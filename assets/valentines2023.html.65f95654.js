Did anything about that seem strange to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Strange?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It all happened so naturally that I didn&#39;t really register it, but now that you mention it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There may have been some Servants mingling who don&#39;t normally get along with each other.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But that&#39;s probably just because this celebration only happens once a year, so everyone&#39;s very excited about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I guess that could be it...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Hmm, I&#39;m not so sure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> This whole mood doesn&#39;t really do it for me. Something about it gives me kind of a bad feeling...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey Gil.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Hi, Master. Hello, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Kiddy Gil!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Ahaha. I don&#39;t mind you calling me that, but maybe out in public isn&#39;t the best place for it.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Just call me Gil, like you would if I was your precocious little brother.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-a little brother, huh... All right. Anyway...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Does all this seem off to you too, Gil?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> It does feel like the atmospheric magical energy density is a little higher than usual.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> But then again, there are lots of magecraft experts here at Chaldea, and they don&#39;t seem too concerned...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> So it could all just be in my head.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> High magical energy density? That&#39;s odd. Sheba&#39;s readings are still within standard parameters...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Gooooood morning! How are you today, Master and Mash?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Oh, and a good morning to you too, young Gilgamesh. You&#39;re looking clever as ever today!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Hmm, this works out nicely.

If we weren&#39;t sure something strange was going on before, we certainly are now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Come on, Senpai, let&#39;s go to the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Something strange is definitely happening here at Chaldea, just like you suspected, Gil!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ve gotta let Da Vinci know about this!</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Nnn, you know, I&#39;m not sure we should be making more work for her.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I mean, even with Edison and Tesla back there...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Couldn&#39;t it just be that their long and bitter rivalry finally came to an end?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I mean, I haven&#39;t experienced this myself, since I&#39;m not my grown-up version...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> But I have heard that the more you dislike someone, the better friends you become with them after having a knock-down, drag-out fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know. That seems...unlikely with them...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Come to think of it, one of your Noble Phantasms has the power to see through everything, right, Gil?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that why you had a bad feeling about this? Because you noticed something we couldn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> You mean Sha Naqba Imuru? Unfortunately, it&#39;s not working very well...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...thanks to an even more powerful omnipotent being messing with humanity.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...and there are still some residual imbalances in humanity.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...since you can&#39;t be omnipotent when the entire Earth&#39;s future has been wiped clean.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> So this is really more of a hunch.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Anyway, why were you two at the cafeteria, anyway? Was there something you wanted to do there?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Maybe you were waiting for the right time to give a certain special someone a gift?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I... Um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, that can wait until later. Right now, I think we should investigate this hunch of yours.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. It was mean of me to ask that.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> You&#39;re right. Important things should be saved for the right time and place.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> You shouldn&#39;t do it now, right when it seems like something big is about to happen at any mo\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru! Oh good, you&#39;re there too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sorry to bother you when you&#39;re off duty, but I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ve got something of an emergency here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Do you guys think you could help me out?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course. Actually, we were just on our way to the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s the emergency this time? A Singularity?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, it&#39;s not that. This abnormality is taking place right inside Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Apparently, we&#39;ve got Shadow Servants running around the place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Shadow Servants!? And they&#39;re inside Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Nnn...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Da Vinci?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, the thing is, they definitely look like Shadow Servants...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But their existence is so...fuzzy that we can&#39;t get a firm reading on them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So I was hoping you could go investigate and/or take care of them directly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, and don&#39;t worry about coming to the Command Room. There&#39;s no need.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So what do you say, Fujimaru? Will you take Mash and go look into this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Then I think I&#39;ll go, too. You don&#39;t mind, right, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, hey, Kid Gil! You&#39;re there too, huh? Of course not! That&#39;d be a big help!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> See, I tried asking other Servants around there to help deal with this as well...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But for some reason, they all said they already had plans or just didn&#39;t feel like it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really? All of them?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yup. But anyway, there&#39;s no point laying into them about it now.

You don&#39;t mind, right, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, if it isn&#39;t Kid Gil! You&#39;re there too, huh? By all means, I&#39;d be grateful for your help.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> See, I tried asking other Servants around there to help deal with this as well...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But for some reason, they all said they already had plans or just didn&#39;t feel like it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really?

And they do look like Shadow Servants.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> It&#39;s okay if we take them down, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm. Yeah, I guess it is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We still don&#39;t know how they got here, but there&#39;s no upside to letting them run around doing whatever.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm. Yeah, I guess it is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We still don&#39;t know how they got here, but there&#39;s no upside to letting them run around doing whatever.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So yeah, go ahead and take care of them now, and we&#39;ll figure out where they came from later.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I couldn&#39;t agree more. Well then, here goes nothing.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Gate of\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wait! Stooop! No Babylon! No Babylon!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m sure yours wouldn&#39;t be as bad as your grown-up self&#39;s, but we still can&#39;t have Servants just slinging around Noble Phantasms all will-nilly in the halls!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Hang on. Did you just say I&#39;m weaker than the adult me? Ouch.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I know I&#39;m a kid, but my Noble Phantasm still works fine. I know how to control it, too.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I was only going to use it to restrain them, anyway.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> \u201CBeating\u201D your opponents just by killing them is the kind of shortsighted thing grown-ups who are too lazy to think big picture do.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> There, see? I&#39;m just going to neutralize them one by one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> C-classy as the legendary king you are...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s working! Gil&#39;s chains just captured all five Shadow Servants!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right, Master, let&#39;s go deal with these potentially hostile entitie\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Look out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Khh... There are even more than we realized!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll handle this shadow, Master! You help Gil\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> What happened, Master? You and Mash are usually way more careful than that. You get sloppy &#39;cause it&#39;s a holiday or something?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Times like this are exactly when you&#39;ve gotta pay attention to your surroundings!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> C\xFA Chulainn!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> C\xFA Chulainn! Thank you for helping us!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Don&#39;t bother thanking me. I was just getting warmed up.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> If anything, I&#39;m sorry I took so long to get here. Didn&#39;t realize you guys needed help at first.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Anyway, this works out nicely. I was just looking for something to do.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Really?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I&#39;d say if anyone here&#39;s being sloppy, it&#39;s you. Shouldn&#39;t you be more on top of things, being a grown-up and all?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Me? Shouldn&#39;t you be telling your own grown-up self that, too?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Next time you&#39;re at a mirror, why don&#39;t you pass him a message that he should try to hang on to at least a tenth of the wisdom and modesty you&#39;ve got as a kid!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Well, I do agree with that, but unlike you, I&#39;m just as wise no matter what age I am.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Yeah? That your way of saying you&#39;ve always been this dumb!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Ah, but never mind. This ain&#39;t the time to be arguing. C&#39;mon, Fujimaru and Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh... R-right! I&#39;m good to go at any time!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Dammit, they just keep regenerating as soon as you cut them down! We&#39;ll never get anywhere like this!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> These things are as tough as Clan Calatin! We&#39;ve gotta figure something out before they destroy all of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Excuse me, Command Room? Is there any way we can get rid of these things for good?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sorry! I wish I could tell you, but we&#39;re still analyzing these things! We&#39;ve never seen anything like them!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All we know so far is, they don&#39;t have Spirit Cores, their Spirit Origins disperse, and your attacks make them disappear!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sorry! I wish I could tell you, but we&#39;re still analyzing these things! We&#39;ve never seen anything like them!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All we know so far is, they don&#39;t have Spirit Cores, their Spirit Origins disperse, and your attacks make them disappear!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The only thing is, they&#39;re not staying that way! Man, I wonder why they keep coming back!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...She&#39;s really enjoying this, isn&#39;t she? Whose idea was it to put her in charge, anyway?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Hey, I think it&#39;s great that we&#39;ve got someone so enthusiastic about her job backing us up. In the meantime, we&#39;ll just have to do the best we can to wrap things up he\u2013</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Hang on. Is someone there!? I just got some major chills down my spine!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, well, your senses are quite refined. I wish my assistants had that kind of sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Aah! I&#39;ve never felt chills like this before! No, wait. It&#39;s actually kind of familiar!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Buon giorno. Don&#39;t worry, I mean you no harm.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Allow me to explain why those things refuse to stay gone.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> They are not actually Shadow Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> There is no point in using violence against those born in the depths of darkness.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> No, there is only one way to truly make them disappear.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hehe. Only one way, huh. That&#39;s pretty bold, even for me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But I&#39;m not embarrassed at all, since it&#39;s the unvarnished truth.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You see, the only way to get rid of them is something that is of utmost importance to all humans...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Love.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Love? Did she really say \u201Clove\u201D?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...You&#39;re not very sensitive at all, are you? Are you sure you&#39;re the ultimate Celtic ladies&#39; man?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The very same who jumped into bed with every beautiful woman he met on his travels even after he gave his true love a castle?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Ugh, just saying it out loud irritates me all over again. Are you just that selfish, or does your \u201Clittle spear\u201D actually have a mind of its own?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You&#39;d better apologize to A\xEDfe the next time you see her.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I know, I know! It was all my fault, okay!? Now would you mind keeping your nose out of my business!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (That&#39;s a hell of a way to talk to someoneyou just met... Who is this girl, anyway?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (The ultimate Celtic ladies&#39; man, huh.)</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Hehe. I only got the broad strokes but those were some lovely thoughts.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You pass. I officially recognize you as a Master worthy of being hoisted into the air.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hello, and good day. Your fortune this morning is five out of five stars.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Your romantic outlook for today is, \u201CPrepare for unexpected encounters.\u201D Put another way, \u201CTrust the goddess before you rather than the person next to you.\u201D</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That&#39;s right. I have deigned to descend from on high to raise your fortun\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...I suppose I should have known they wouldn&#39;t be polite enough to let me finish. Oh well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I usually make it a point never to provide help without an explicit agreement, but in this case, I suppose I can consider it part of my sales pitch.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Feel free to command me as you see fit, Master.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This is your chance to test your power as a Master and the power of my love to your heart&#39;s content.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh!? Did she just form a temporary contract with you, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like she did!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> All right then, let&#39;s get to work!</p><hr><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> All right, let me show you what I was talking about. Just sit back and enjoy the show.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This is the light of love that banishes darkness...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The light of love that will fill the entire world!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> God Bazooka. Die.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Phew...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Was it good for you, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Back up. Did you just tell them to die!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Who, me? Don&#39;t be silly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Also, that was clearly just a bazooka blast. Where did love come into it!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Er... That said, the, uh\u2013non-Shadow Servants? \u2013do seem to have disappeared now...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...(She&#39;s bad news, isn&#39;t she?) (*Conveyed to Kid Gil via subtle wink)</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...(Oh yes. Very bad news.) (*Conveyed to C\xFA Chulainn via subtle wink)</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...Hey, kid. She&#39;s a friend of yours, right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> So go on, get her out of here already. And make sure she never comes back.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Hahaha, don&#39;t be ridiculous. This is the first time I&#39;ve seen such a person around Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> If anything, you&#39;re the one who seemed to recognize her.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Are you sure she&#39;s not from your neck of the woods? Maybe you used to date her or something.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Now who&#39;s bein&#39; ridiculous!? Trust me, not even the Celts go in for love that crazy!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> No, I&#39;ve never seen her before, either. She looks vaguely familiar, but that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Besides, no way would I forget such an evil face.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> There, you see? I&#39;m sure she remembers you even if you don&#39;t remember her.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> (Slaps)</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Yeowww!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Quiet, both of you. When did you two become such whiny little mongrels, anyway?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Careless words lead to disaster, and vague memories lead to confusion. So if you&#39;re ever unsure whether you should say something, here&#39;s an easy rule of thumb: don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, um... I appreciate you helping us out here... but you&#39;re not a Chaldean Servant, are you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Who in the world are you, anyway?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My name is Amor. The god of love.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong> I&#39;m a beautiful, dainty Divine Spirit where what you see is what you get. A pleasure to make your acquaintance\u2661</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Amor?

Given that most people who get chosen as vessels for gods tend to not exactly be...well, normal...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I wonder where you&#39;ll fall on that spectrum...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> All right, that&#39;s enough fan service. I&#39;m going to go back to my regular outfit now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh wow, your outfit is beautiful! Are you a student, Amo\u2013er, Caren?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Your clothes are very chic, of course, but I especially love your hat! It&#39;s so cute and elegant!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> No, I&#39;m not a student per se... This is just the new outfit I had made up for this occasion.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I&#39;m glad to hear you like it, though. Collecting hats is one of my few hobbies.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Your few hobbies...?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Thank you, Mash\xE9rie. May I give you an arrow of love as a token of my appreciation?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-that&#39;s all right, thank you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Also, it&#39;s \u201CMash\u201D not Mash\xE9rie!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I see. How very selfless of you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It&#39;s too bad you won&#39;t take a treat when it&#39;s offered. (For one thing, it&#39;s so much more boring...)</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> All right, what if I played you a song on my organ then? Perhaps Bach&#39;s Cantata BWV 147, in honor of getting to know one another?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It&#39;s one of the few things I&#39;m proud of.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Only a few, huh?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> (Slaps)</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Ow, ow, ow!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> What was that for!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Pardon me. I sensed you two were slandering me for no good reason.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> As for you, I&#39;ve noticed you haven&#39;t so much as batted an eye at anything I&#39;ve said or done since I arrived.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> You must be either extremely important, or just extremely easygoing.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Which means...you must be Fujimaru, the Master of Chaldea. Right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...Hehe. That&#39;ll be another thing worth testing, then...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> You&#39;ll have to forgive me for pressuring you to accept that, um, temporary contract earlier.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It was just a means to an end to let me receive orders from you...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So if you ever find our connection to be a burden, please feel free to sever it at any time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Caren C. Hortensia?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Hm? ...Oh, you mean me. Well, that certainly is a lot to say every single time, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s okay, you can just call me Caren.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-all right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Caren, do you know anything about those not-Shadow Servants?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Ah, those? Let&#39;s see... I think the simplest way to describe them is...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong></p><h1 id="ectoplasm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ectoplasm" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ectoplasm.</h1><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Hmm, that took a bit of a strange turn, didn&#39;t it? Let me try that again.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Think of them as evil spirits drawn to the wickedness that lies in people&#39;s hearts.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> You could also call it animosity, or impurities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see...I think.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right, now that we know what they are, why did they suddenly show up here at Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Good question... Unfortunately, I can&#39;t think of a simple explanation for that.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I expect it probably has something to do with Valentine&#39;s Day, though. Especially since I&#39;m here, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, can you elaborate on that?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It wasn&#39;t Fujimaru that summoned me here.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It was this festival of love you call Valentine&#39;s Day that called me here temporarily.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Valentine&#39;s Day is the cause of all of this.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It was Valentine&#39;s Day that birthed those evil spirit creatures...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> And it was Valentine&#39;s Day that summoned me here as a missionary of love.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Now do you get it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I really don&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not even a little.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Right? I don&#39;t even know what the hell you were trying to say.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I do wish you wouldn&#39;t try to make arguments with foregone conclusions.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Ahem. I was explaining the reason I was summoned here.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I am a missionary here to save Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I sensed the encroaching threat that Valentine&#39;s Day posed\u2013by which I mean those evil spirit creatures...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...so I was sent here in the Lord&#39;s name to save you all from that threat.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Well, it may not have happened exactly like that, but you understand what I am saying, yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (So, how does the bazooka fit into all that...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (So Valentine&#39;s Day is a threat, huh.

That&#39;s much more in line with the whole Valentine&#39;s Day thing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, they&#39;re pretty tough\u2013well, immortal, really, which makes them dangerous.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At least we were able to eliminate the ones you found there with that, um, unusual ordnance (read: bazooka)...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But am I right to assume that those Bitter Shadows are going to show up again, Caren?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...Say it again.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Huh? Say what again? Do you not care for the name \u201CBitter Shadows\u201D?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Not that. My name. Say it again, please.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> U-uh, okay...Caren. (You know, for a missionary of love, I get the feeling she&#39;s kind of starved for it herself.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At any rate, those weren&#39;t the last Bitter Shadows, were they?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> No, they weren&#39;t.

We can&#39;t let her down.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> As Servants who&#39;ve been around much longer than she has, don&#39;t you think the manly thing to do is to live up to her expectations?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...(Sigh) I&#39;ve never cared one way or another for doing things because they&#39;re \u201Cmanly.\u201D That seems like a stupid, self-defeating way to approach life.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> But, if Mash needs my help, then I guess I&#39;ll just have to step up.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Attaboy!

Could&#39;ve fooled me. You look like you can&#39;t wait to tell us.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> All right, what is it then?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Well, you see...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> My bazooka requires a very particular type of cartridge...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...which means I have to charge a...modest usage fee for every shot I fire.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It comes to about this much.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Are you freaking kidding me!?!?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Yikes.

But, I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s going to be a problem.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> We can&#39;t defeat the Bitters without the bazooka, but I simply won&#39;t pay for its cartridges myself...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Hmm... Hmmm... Oh, I just had an idea.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> What if we did something like this?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Instead of paying me directly to use my bazooka, you could all collect materials I can exchange for mon\u2013</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Ahem. I mean, which I can use to make more godly cartridges.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> What&#39;s more, as luck would have it...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> There&#39;s plenty of small bits of magical energy floating around that can&#39;t become Bitter Shadows.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> You won&#39;t need my bazooka to handle them, and as they say, a penny saved is a penny earned.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So I&#39;d like you all to work tirelessly to eliminate those bits, collect materials, and donate them to me.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> You don&#39;t mind doing that, right? It&#39;s all to restore peace to Chaldea, after all.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Good. Then I&#39;ll be counting on all of you to keep those donations coming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, I guess Valentine&#39;s Day&#39;s isn&#39;t gonna save itself.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...Yeah, all right. I&#39;m not gonna back out now after coming this far.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Something tells me just getting rid of the Bitter Shadows isn&#39;t going to be the end of this, though.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> It can&#39;t be a good sign that both our warrior&#39;s intuitions are telling us this is a bad idea.</p><h2 id="section-3-lost-sheep" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-lost-sheep" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Lost Sheep</h2><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I was given knowledge of this place when Amor chose me for his vessel...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...but it&#39;s still a surprise to see the Chaldea Security Organization up and running.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> All these different Heroic Spirits coming together to face a threat to the very world and restore humanity...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Well, it&#39;s all very inspiring.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Any chance you might want to join them, Caren?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You know, we could really use your help, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Of course. I would never have become a Pseudo-Servant if I weren&#39;t interested in helping.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Truly, it is all thanks to the Lord that I was given this opportunity.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Not to mention that, with all of these fine Heroic Spirits...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...I should be able to realize my dream of an ideal world filled with love.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Hmm.

It&#39;s as though we&#39;re bound by unbreakable diamond chains.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you sure you&#39;ve never met them before?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Oh yes, absolutely.

Oh, yes. I have a very clear mental picture now.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Erice, was it?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I can tell that you must have respected me\u2013 I mean, this other Caren, a great deal.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> What a beautiful teacher and student relationship you must have had.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> That goes for the rest of you, too. Thank you for adoring the me you knew in your worlds.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong> N-not at all, um, God Caren!

Do you have an idea, Miyu?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong> Well, um, it&#39;s probably not that big a deal...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong> But there is a new kind of chocolate being sold here that&#39;s been all the rage lately.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong> It&#39;s so hard to get ahold of that everyone calls it elusory chocolate.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Gotcha. So it&#39;s the kind of thing where stores make up some special limited edition item to drum up interest, right?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Come on, C\xFA Chulainn, you don&#39;t have to put it like that.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> It may be something of a last resort, but these struggling small businesses need to spread the word somehow, right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...At least I didn&#39;t call it a \u201Clast resort\u201D...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Anyway, what about this elusory chocolate struck you as being out of the ordinary?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Well, we&#39;ve only heard rumors ourselves, and we&#39;re not sure how credible they are...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> But they say that the merchant selling this chocolate comes and goes in the blink of an eye...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> ...And that they wear a paper bag over their head.

No, seriously, what the hell&#39;s that all about!?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I-I do have a hard time seeing how that could have any connection to this Bitter Shadows incident...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Are you sure it&#39;s even someone from Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong> Everyone says it&#39;s probably just the kykeon lady or someone from the Servantverse...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong> ...and they don&#39;t seem concerned at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Guess it&#39;s possible to get TOO used to stuff like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Erice:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong> Those guys seemed like they were anxious about something today, too.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong> I wonder if that had anything to do with these Bitter Shadows...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Did you sense something amiss too, Ms. Erice?</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t be that specific really.

Since you&#39;re Eros, the god of erotic love...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong> I bet you&#39;ll have no problem turning this place into a world positively dripping with love, just the way I like...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong> ...even with all these Goody Two-shoes fighting you at every turn.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong> (...Hehe.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong> (Yes, that&#39;s right.

Wait right here and I&#39;ll prove it!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong> I can easily handle some fake Shadow Servants by myself!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong> Come on, you idiot!

I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re still ignorant of such a basic fact.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Our definitions of love are different.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Your love is all about building you and your loved ones up together, with their consent.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> The very fact that you talk about \u201Cproviding\u201D love proves that it&#39;s very different from my kind of love.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> God the Father&#39;s love simply exists.

I guess you can&#39;t really say \u201Cthemselves\u201D there.</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon:</strong> Exactly, K.G.</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon:</strong> But, now that there&#39;re two of them, all their problems should be solved!</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon:</strong> Now, even Kama-cho can ask someone for help when it comes to matters of the heart!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> R-really?

You can&#39;t go prying into other people&#39;s business just because it&#39;s fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You guys actually do get along pretty well, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Hahaha, can you undo this spell now, Medea? It reeeally hurts having my hands twisted behind my back.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Sleep!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (Zzz...)</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Phew, he certainly put up a fight. But at least that should take care of that...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Now, what are you all doing here?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I was just curious about the bloodbath I was sure we were headed for.

Not you too, Master?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Well, I guess it&#39;s okay. I was planning to talk to you about this, anyway.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Take a look. This is why Jason was acting so strangely.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Is that...chocolate?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Specifically, it&#39;s the elusory chocolate that&#39;s all the rage in Chaldea right now, even though it&#39;s very hard to get hold of.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> And its name is...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong></p><h1 id="god-love" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#god-love" aria-hidden="true">#</a> God Love.</h1><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Well, that ain&#39;t fishy at all.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Anyway, after a while of hearing about how amazing this chocolate was, I finally managed to get my hands on some.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> But as it turns out, it also contained trace amounts of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I tried to ask the woman selling it about that, but she ran off before I had the chance.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> What did this woman look like?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Huh? I don&#39;t know. She was wearing a paper bag over her head.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Honestly, I figured it was just more Servantverse nonsense.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> (We&#39;re all definitely too used to this sort of thing...)</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Anyway, she might have gotten away, but I still had the chocolate I bought from her...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> ...so I decided to examine it more thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> In doing so, I found out that it definitely has some kind of effect on whoever eats it...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> ...but I still didn&#39;t know exactly what that effect is.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> That was when Jason happened by...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you used him as a guinea pig, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong> After that, well, you all know what happened next. Jason turned into a weirdly...nice version of himself.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Hang on.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> You telling us this chocolate has the power to change people&#39;s personalities?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> So that&#39;s what&#39;s been going on here.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> That explains why all those other Servants were acting so much friendlier than usual.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Well, in Jason&#39;s case...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> ...there&#39;s a part of me that wouldn&#39;t mind just leaving him like this...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> But seeing him be THIS nice is actually turning out to be sort of creepy, right?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> How wonderful.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Finding forgiveness in your heart even for someone who has hurt you over and over...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Now that is true neighborly agape. I love to see it.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> That said, it would certainly have been more fun to watch if she&#39;d been willing to sling a little more mud...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> What do you think my life is!? Some kind of reality TV show!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Oh gosh. Did you just read my mind!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Hehehe. It&#39;s a little embarrassing to have my private thoughts revealed, but I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, seeing as you&#39;re a mage from the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I must say, true Mystics really are a wonder to behold. You&#39;ll have to teach me your magical telepathy secrets sometime.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> What are you talking about!? You were blabbing your \u201Cprivate thoughts\u201D for all to hear!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I get it. Sometimes, you can&#39;t help but want to point out the sheer craziness in things she says.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Tell me about it. Half the time, I can&#39;t even tell whether she&#39;s joking.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I&#39;ll say!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I don&#39;t know who the hell you are, but you&#39;ve got a lot of nerve talking to me like you know anything about\u2013</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Do I know you from somewhere?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Hmm, I couldn&#39;t tell you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> My name is Caren C. Hortensia, but please, call me Caren.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I&#39;m also serving as a vessel for the Divine Spirit Amor.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> That&#39;s Amoooooor, not amour.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Amor...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> As in Eros!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Oh my, that was frightening. Why are you attacking me?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I suppose you have some history with this god of love.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> You bet I do!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Do you have any idea how much you all messed up my life!?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I never imagined I&#39;d get a chance to take my revenge on you here...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> But you better believe I won&#39;t let it pass me by now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What did you do to her, Caren?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Well, um, strictly speaking...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It was Eros and Aphrodite who did it, not me.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Aphrodite... She&#39;s one of the major Greek gods, right? I remember hearing she had strong ties to Eros as well.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> A long, long, very long time ago, back when the earth was still awash in Mystics...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Aphrodite, with Eros&#39;s help, bewitched gods and humans alike.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Of the many such schemes she came up with, one of them was named something like:</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> \u201CMake Queen Medea Fall Head Over Heels for Jason.\u201D</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I trust you can see where this is going now?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Eros, under orders to help Jason obtain the Golden Fleece...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...nocked an arrow filled with Aphrodite&#39;s blessings and curses on his prized bow...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> And boom, it just worked.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Don&#39;t you talk about the worst time of my life like it&#39;s some kind of damn infomercial!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Did you just jump INTO her line of fire!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Um... Yes, but, uh, I didn&#39;t have a choice... Eros&#39;s crimes are, um, mine to bear as well, you see...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So even though being punished definitely isn&#39;t my thing\u2013not...not at all\u2013I, uh, have to take it all the same...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Hmph. So you&#39;re at least aware of what you did, Pseudo-Servant or not.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> That&#39;s right, Eros! If it wasn&#39;t for that damn arrow of yours...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> My whole life could have been completely different!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh-oh.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Crap! That&#39;s Bitter Shadow magical energy!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh no. It looks like it&#39;s attracted to...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...Medea&#39;s anger!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Oh my, how terrible.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Now the Bitter Shadows have got Medea, too. Oopsies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You could at least pretend to be worried!</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Well, I guess it just goes to show what happens when you let anger take the wheel.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> All right, everyone, you&#39;re up.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Now that Medea&#39;s unconscious, you need to stop her before she goes on a wild rampage throughout\u2013</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I&#39;m still perfectly conscious, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I&#39;m a witch from the Age of Gods, remember!?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> This is nowhere near too much magical energy for me to control.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> In fact, this is perfect. I&#39;m going to use all this new power now at my command...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> ...to hit you with a spell powerful enough to blow all of Chaldea away!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, um, could you maybe NOT do that, please!?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Hey. Whose side should we take here?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Don&#39;t ask me.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Besides, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s our place to say anything, since it&#39;s not really any of our business.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> And on that note, I just remembered some urgent business of my own, so if you&#39;ll excuse me...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Oh no, you don&#39;t! You&#39;re not leaving me to deal with this alone!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Ohhh noooooo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> C-Caren!?</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Well...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I do feel a little better now.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Really? I&#39;m surprised.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I didn&#39;t think you would be satisfied until you tore five, maybe six limbs off me.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I&#39;m pretty sure you only have four!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Just when I thought she went down like a punk, she springs back like nothing happened...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Seriously, what is her deal?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I could tear every one of you limb from limb and I doubt that goddess would so much as bat an eye.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I don&#39;t know what it is you&#39;re up to here...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> But I&#39;m not about to waste any more of my time on a doll.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> So let&#39;s just say this trip down memory lane is over now, shall we?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Medea...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Don&#39;t look at me like that, Master.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> As I just said, I won&#39;t get in your way any longer, but I&#39;m not going to help you, either.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> You&#39;re going to have to deal with this mess yourselves.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Here&#39;s the chocolate I told you about.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I suggest you give it to Da Vinci so she can take a closer look at it.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about Jason lying on the floor there. I&#39;ll take care of him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks, Mentor.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> That reminds me... Don&#39;t you think you have a few too many mentors these days?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t kill you to show me just a little more in the way of deference, you know.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Huh?

Drunk? And yes, I mean you, not the Servants who ate the chocolate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hahaha. I can see why you&#39;d think that, but no, I&#39;m not. Just hear me out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You know how eating something yummy can make you feel really good?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s basically a mild state of euphoria, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, when a Servant eats this chocolate, that state is heightened considerably.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;d guess they probably become very easygoing and content.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That by itself isn&#39;t a problem, of course.

No matter what our culture or environment, we all feel revitalized by a good meal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, this chocolate is kind of turns that concept up to eleven...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But in addition to its euphoric effect, we also know now that it causes a Servant&#39;s Spirit Core to give off an unusual kind of magical energy.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Magical energy... So then, is that\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yup. It matches the data from our analysis perfectly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That very magical energy the chocolate induces is what&#39;s responsible for these Bitter Shadows spawning in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I see. Caren said that something was drawing the Bitter Shadows here...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> But in fact...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> They spawned from Servants who ate this God Love chocolate without the Servants realizing.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Do I have that right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> You&#39;ve gotta be kidding me. So you&#39;re telling me the chocolate didn&#39;t so much have something to do with all this...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...as it was the cause of the whole thing!?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Looks that way.

I&#39;m having Mash run a trace on it even as we speak.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How&#39;s it going, Mash? Find anything yet?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I&#39;ve been checking each of the energy supply lines one by one, and I found where power&#39;s being siphoned off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s the unoccupied staff room at the end of the western corridor in section B.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It didn&#39;t look like there was anything out of the ordinary there on the security camera...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...but when I looked at it with Sheba, it said the room&#39;s interior was impossible to measure.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...I see. Then like Kid Gil said, that pretty much clinches it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> All right! Nice work, missy!

It must be all the thoughts and feelings her chocolate represses leaking out from their hosts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Then all those negative emotions turn into magical energy, and form the Bitter Shadows when it comes together.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Right. That&#39;s why you can&#39;t eliminate them with violence, and especially not with lust.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> The only way is to purify them with agape before eradicating them.

Now do you understand?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The only problem with that is, as long as people remain people, they&#39;ll never be rid of negative emotions completely.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Which means that the magical energy they&#39;re leaking will eventually spread through all of Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...until the whole place is basically overrun with Bitter Shadows.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I swear, that God Love stuff should&#39;ve never been brought to market!</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong> But we make it with painstaking care.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong> It shouldn&#39;t have any adverse effects on anyone&#39;s health.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> And our aftercare regimen is flawless.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> God Love is perfectly safe, and starting today, we&#39;ll be distributing it for free!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Are you freaking kidding me!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> After all the work you made us do, you&#39;re just gonna give that crap out for free!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Yes. And it&#39;s all thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> With all of you gathering bazooka round materials, and me using them to destroy the Bitter Shadows...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> We&#39;ve been able to keep Valentine&#39;s Day sweet and peaceful for everyone.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I call that a win-win, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I, uh, I see...?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Don&#39;t let her fool you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> The only reason the Bitter Shadows showed up and ruined Valentine&#39;s Day in the first place...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...is because of this harebrained scheme of hers.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Heck, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she&#39;d known about the Bitter Shadows thing from the start.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Oh my... Are you saying I knowingly sold defective product to my customers!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Well, okay, I DID, but still.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Originally, I thought I could handle any incidental messes on my own...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> But all their negative thoughts and feelings turned out to be much stronger than I expected.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> All I can say is, it seems Chaldea&#39;s working environment leaves a lot to be desired.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re not wrong.</p><p><strong>Mash &amp; Da Vinci:</strong> Senpai!? Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not much room to talk, given how you treat your employees.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Oh, are you sure you want to say that, when you still haven&#39;t yet tasted my whip for yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong> At any rate... (Sigh) I should have known you&#39;d do something like this, Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It&#39;s clear everyone here distrusts me now, and it&#39;s all thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Why, before you said that, C\xFA Chulainn there trusted me so much he would have given me the shirt off his back.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> The hell you say!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I haven&#39;t trusted you for one second of this mess which, lest we forget, YOU MADE!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> It&#39;s true. And I said you were definitely up to something the first time you showed up, too.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Which reminds me, Amor: What is it you&#39;re really up to here, anyway?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Oh my, how terrible. I had no idea that&#39;s how you&#39;ve seen me all this time.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> And after I&#39;ve been showering you with all this love, too.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Hmph. You mean your agape? Nope, not buying that selfless love routine.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Anything that spreads itself thin enough to reach anyone and everyone may as well not even exist at all.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...That was a pretty cutting comeback for a mongrel.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Still, mutual understanding was never one of my goals, so you&#39;re welcome to argue till you&#39;re blue in the face.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> The Lord&#39;s love is given freely, while asking nothing in return.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It is the ultimate gospel that illuminates the world, blankets the whole of the earth, and brings salvation to all people.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So by mass-producing delicious and nutritious God Love...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I&#39;ll use love to bring salvation to everyone at Chaldea, and eventually, all of humanity.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> That is my plan.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I&#39;m Amor, god of love. I have a purpose to fulfill.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So if you mean to interfere with that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We definitely do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You better believe it.</p><hr><p><strong>Amor:</strong> Ahh, how deplorable...</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong> Ahh, how delectable... Whoops. I mean, deplorable...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Well said. Oh, but not you, Eros. I&#39;ll have to give you another hundred lashes later.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> But yes, this truly is a pity. What a shame that we were evidently destined to fight after all...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Oh, what a crock! You don&#39;t look sad about this at all! You look positively eager!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> But, nonetheless, if this is the trial the Lord has set before me, then the struggle is the glory.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> C\xFA Chulainn, Gilgamesh. Mash\xE9rie. Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Defeating you will help me grow even more as a Divinity, so that&#39;s just what I&#39;m going to do.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> After that, it won&#39;t be long before you see me dominate the world with love!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Now she&#39;s even starting to sound like a final boss!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Come on, Fujimaru! Let&#39;s finish her off!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> You know... I can&#39;t remember anything about it, but I&#39;m sure I know her from somewhere.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> And what&#39;s more, I can tell she was exactly like this back then, too.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> So maybe it really is fate that I get to help stop you here.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> By the time we&#39;re done with you, you&#39;re gonna wish you&#39;d never even heard the word \u201Cplan\u201D!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no.

All relationships eventually end.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> That&#39;s why love tainted with lust is a far cry from true love.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong> Eeek!</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong> Please forgive me, Lady Caren! I really don&#39;t think I can take anymore!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Um, do you mind if I say something?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Yes? What is it, Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Well, I couldn&#39;t help but notice...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...that you tend to treat Kama and Eros pretty harshly.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> It actually reminds me of the God Love.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> You&#39;ve been using it to try and suppress lust, along with other negative emotions.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> You clearly consider sexual desire to be, well, vulgar...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> So I can&#39;t help but wonder why Eros, the god of sexual desire, would want you as a vessel.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Really, there&#39;s something...contradictory about your whole existence.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey, yeah... There is, isn&#39;t there?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Not necessarily. From what I know about Amor, or Eros, or whatever you call him...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He may well have had a reason for choosing his polar opposite for an avatar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Not necessarily. From what I know about Amor, or Eros, or whatever you call him...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He may well have had a reason for choosing his polar opposite for an avatar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s got something to do with one of Eros&#39;s more well-known stories.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In it, Eros has been spending his life wandering around firing his arrows of love at whoever catches his fancy, just like his mother ordered him to do.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But then, one day, he meets a human girl... and falls in love with her.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The rest of their story plays out about how you expect.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Extenuating circumstances, overcoming adversity, happily ever after... You get the gist.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, the girl&#39;s name was Psyche, something close to \u201Cheart\u201D in Greek.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And of course, I don&#39;t have to tell you that Eros means &quot;love.&quot;</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So when you think about what this story of a union between heart and love is saying...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...you realize it has some interesting implications.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, if Eros is \u201Clove\u201D... and Psyche is \u201Cheart\u201D...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That would imply that love and the heart are separate things. Which would mean... Oh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, you&#39;re saying Eros doesn&#39;t possess a heart?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...Aha. Now I get it. Since he doesn&#39;t possess a heart...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s willing to carry out any order given to him, no matter how cruel...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...and to accept any punishment, no matter how cruel? Is that it?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> No. I treat Eros that way because he likes it.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong> No I don&#39;t. That&#39;s your thing, not mine.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Shut up. I was just getting to the good part.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Ahem. Here&#39;s the deal. Eros, or Amor, or whatever you call him, is a tragic god.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> He had the power to control love, but no heart to understand it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I knew it!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> One day, he came to me in a dream...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...and asked me what true love is.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> But that is very difficult to put into words...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So instead, I decided to show him a sample case.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> A sample case?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> The hell kind of sample case did you show to a freaking god?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I told you, it&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I showed him the form love should take.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...And what was that?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> A world without conflict. A world where people cherish their neighbors, and no classes divide society.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I showed him an ideal world...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...where I, as its benevolent dictator, control all things.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> The hell!? That&#39;s just another dystopia!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So what? What&#39;s wrong with a benevolent dictatorship?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> My duty is to use this power to guide the world where it&#39;s meant to go...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> To make the ideal world I showed him a reality.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. Since people alone are incapable of being truly happy...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I must use the Lord&#39;s love to bestow happiness upon everyone equally!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...a Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What, was it formed by Valentine&#39;s Day power or something!? Then again, with all these Heroic Spirits around, I guess that&#39;s totally plausible!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, if there&#39;s a Holy Grail involved, that&#39;d explain how she showed up without anyone summoning her!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> That&#39;s right. The Holy Grail was first drawn here by all those couples and their lecherous affections.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It then summoned the god of love, who in turn sought someone with a heart: me.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> That is the chain of fate that led us here.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> And now, I&#39;m sure that what I am about to do...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...is only a fulfillment of God&#39;s will.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That chocolate... Is that God Love!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> God Love amplifies the love within anyone who eats it, and represses their negative emotions.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So I wonder. What will happen if I, a true believer of love, eat it instead?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I think the time has come to find out.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong> No, Lady Caren, don&#39;t! You mustn&#39;t push yourself any further!</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong> (Sigh...) I knew you&#39;d end up going down that route eventually, Caren.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Why the hell didn&#39;t either of you try to stop her, then!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Seriously, don&#39;t do this, Caren! There&#39;s no way anything good&#39;ll come of it!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Hehe...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> As they say in Rome: Porca miseria, why don&#39;t you mind your own business, Lancer!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh? Where are we!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The chocolate factor seems to have transformed into something...else.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hehe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Caren? Is that you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This is quite a surprise. Even I wasn&#39;t expecting to gain this much power.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I can feel both powerful love and irresistible desire swirling inside me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> By accepting that desire, and forgiving it...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I have now embodied true agape.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> So I will no longer go by a name as simple as \u201CGod Caren.\u201D</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Now that I am even holier than God...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You may call me...</p><p><strong>Devil Caren:</strong></p><h1 id="super-god-caren" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#super-god-caren" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Super God Caren!</h1><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn &amp; Kid Gil &amp; Mash:</strong></p><h1 id="that-s-not-what-your-name-says" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#that-s-not-what-your-name-says" aria-hidden="true">#</a> That&#39;s not what your name says!</h1><p><strong>Devil Caren:</strong> Oh man, this feels so gooooood!

If you&#39;re so eager for punishment, I can make you cry without making you die.</p><p><strong>Devil Caren:</strong> You&#39;re all going to be drowning in my God Love soon enough, anyway...</p><p><strong>Devil Caren:</strong> So if you&#39;d like to get a head start by having my love lightning zap you down to your soul, that&#39;s fine with me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Khh...

Talk about live and let live, huh?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Everything&#39;s gone back to the usual Valentine&#39;s Day routine, like nothing ever happened.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That goes for everyone who ate the God Love, too. They&#39;re all back to normal now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They sure are. I&#39;ve checked.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Honestly, part of me is impressed that Caren got her chocolate to catch on as much as it did.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She might have been a great marketer in a different life.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Not that it made our lives any easier. Eesh...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Do any of the other Servants even have any idea how hard we worked to get everything and everyone back to normal?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Maybe not, but that just goes to show how peaceful it is again. I&#39;d say that&#39;s a good thing.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> What about you, C\xFA Chulainn? Are you sure you want to be here right now?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I hear Medb is running all around Chaldea looking for you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I know. Why do you think I&#39;m hanging out here, of all places?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u201COf all places\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh right, I just remembered.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Jason was freaking out about some prized collection of his having gone missing earlier.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You guys wouldn&#39;t happen to know anything about that, would you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Whoops. I completely forgot about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> That rare Heracles memorabilia collection?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> You still have that stuff put away? No wonder it still stinks of testosterone in here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hehe. Still, I&#39;m sure Jason will be thrilled when we return his collection.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m glad you think so, because I was about to ask you to do just that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about the rest of the aftermath. I&#39;ll take care of that. Great work, guys.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, and Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just so you know, I don&#39;t have any assignments for you at the moment...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So now&#39;s your chance to make the most of Valentine&#39;s Day.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They sure are.

Thank you, Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Oh, hey, uh...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I just remembered I have to do...something. Gotta run.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Come on, kid, you too.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Huh? I don&#39;t want to go.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I&#39;m going to stay right here so I can see how this all plays out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, how what plays out...?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Just come on already! You and I&#39;re going to go make the arounds in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> What!? I never signed up for that!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, that sounds perfect.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> ...What did you say?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I didn&#39;t had the time for a nice, relaxed exploration of Chaldea before.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Would you mind if I joined you on your rounds?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Gaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> C-Caren? What are you doing here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, what about your dramatic exit?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Yes, well, that&#39;s what I was planning to do...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> But then I figured I may as well recombine with Eros and Amor. And when I did...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> ...I ended up with just enough magical energy left over to rematerialize.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So that&#39;s what I did. It was pretty easy, too. It seems interpersonal bonds truly are powerful.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Still, I didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go, and it looked too cold to camp out...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So since we already formed a temporary contract once, I thought I&#39;d come back so you could hire me on full-time\u2661</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> No! No chance!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> For once, I agree with you! Don&#39;t do it, Master!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Keep her around, and there&#39;s no telling when she might try and kill you in your slee\u2013</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> (Slaps)</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Yeowww!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> If you have enough energy to protest, then you must also have enough to show me around, no?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> So come on then. I want you to tell me all there is to know about Chaldea&#39;s various facilities.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I intend to stay here for quite a long time, you know.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Nooo freaking waaay!!!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> As for you, Master, I look forward to working with you again.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Now please, don&#39;t mind us. Back to what you were doing. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take care of the rest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-um... Caren?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Aha! There you are, C\xFA!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Who&#39;s that woman with you, and why do you two look so chummy!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Stay right where you are! You&#39;re not going anywhere until you&#39;ve told me everything I want to know!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> Hmm. That must be the famous Queen Medb I&#39;ve heard so much about.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I see. So you&#39;re making passes at people even after being summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> It seems you&#39;re more of a stallion than a ladies&#39; man, C\xFA Chulainn. Or should I say, you dog.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Now you&#39;re outright slandering me!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong> I&#39;m just stating an objective fact. Now, go on. Start running before she catches you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Dammiiiiiit!!!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Why am I still mixed up in this!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Get back heeere!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-so, um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s certainly been an eventful few days, hasn&#39;t it, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know you&#39;ve been through a lot this year thanks to chocolate...again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> B-but, um, they do say that sweets are the best remedy for exhaustion, so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hope you like it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-not at all! It doesn&#39;t even come close to expressing how grateful I am to you for everything you do for me all year, so if anything, I should be the one thanking you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In that case...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Here. This is for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Does this mean...you had a gift prepared for me all this time, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I mean, it is Valentine&#39;s Day, so.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hehe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you, Senpai. This was a wonderful surprise.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that all&#39;s said and done, I think this year&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day turned out wonderfully as well!</p><p></p>', 2390);
