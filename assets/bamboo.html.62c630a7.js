Noel wakes up in a world where she got to know some boy with sharp eyes \n\nin a student uniform, stuff happened, and for whatever reason they became a vampire-hunting duo. \n\nBasically Tsukihime if she was the heroine. In the simplest terms possible, this is the Noel route.\n\n//Noel accepts the fact she isekai-reincarnated without thinking twice.\n\n//She encourages her partner, the guy in student uniform, \n\nwhile they beat big name vampires they weren&#39;t supposed to be able to defeat, \n\nbeat the Toono family head who is (speculated to be) Roa&#39;s incarnation, \n\nbeat the actual Roa when he shows up, and in the end, \n\nbeat the random Red Arc that hadn&#39;t showed up in the story until that point. \n\nHappy end.\n\n//... Except not really. \n\nPartway through the story, Noel starts noticing something was missing.\n\n// In the end, Noel notices Ciel&#39;s absence, rejects this world, and returns to the original world where she&#39;s just a side character... that&#39;s the gist of it\n\n*OP\n\n# Black screen\n\n//He&#39;s represent by Shiki&#39;s sprites and talks like Shiki, \n\nbut he&#39;s somewhat cold. Doesn&#39;t wear glasses.\n\n//His name will always be displayed as &quot;Guy in student uniform&quot;.\n\n@ ???:\n\n... up!\n\nWake up, Ms. Noel!\n\nIf you don&#39;t wake up right now, you&#39;ll die!\n\n@ Noel:\n\n... Whawhat?\n\n#Opening CG_NoelWakesUpAtopTheRubble. \n\nVlov appears as the bad guy in the back of the screen. \n\nShiki is with his knife ready, shielding Noel from Vlov.\n\n-&gt; Quick exposition to get to the Vlov fight already.\n\n* 1st fight - Vlov\n\nAn alternative ending to Noel&#39;s Arcade Mode.\n\nThe guy in student uniform intervened when Vlov was about to beat her.\n\nBut the student can&#39;t fight for multiple reasons. \n\n(He actually just broke up with Arc before coming here. \n\nHe can&#39;t fight because Arc injured him too much there.)\n\nShe defeats Vlov with some help from the understanding young boy \n\nand rides the hype of being on her heroine route.\n\n* 2nd fight - Nega-Noel\n\nHowever, Noel&#39;s self-demotivation was too deep-rooted, \n\ncausing her to develop an evil alter-ego who tries to prevent her \n\nfrom putting any real effort to anything... Nega-Noel. Why?\n\nNega-Noel is a decently capable Noel who can use infinite Black Keys. \n\nNoel cries that she has no chances of winning, \n\nbut the boy supports her saying \n\n&quot;With projectiles, you just need one well-timed hit. \n\nBesides isn&#39;t it cooler to see an expert winning with limited resources?&quot;, \n\nso Noel beats Nega-Noel.\n\n* 3rd fight - Kohaku\n\nNoel infiltrates the Toono residence as a housekeeper. \n\nBut she fails to deceive the real housekeeper.\n\nShe attacks with a Kohaku-ryuu battou while Noel is distracted microwaving her lunch.\n\nMeanwhile, the student who was supposed to be her safety line is chatting with the other maid in the library.\n\n* 4th fight - Akiha\n\n&quot;Perhaps your research wasn&#39;t thorough enough?&quot;,\n\nargued the lady speculated to be Roa&#39;s incarnation, in the coldest tone she could muster.\n\n&quot;(Oh. It&#39;s not her. This girl is not a vampire. She&#39;s something worse.)&quot;\n\nNoel&#39;s natural danger sense told her to get away from the mansion fast.\n\nThat&#39;s when the boy in the uniform appeared.\n\n&quot;Huh, you&#39;re leaving already? Then I&#39;m going with you. \n\nYou don&#39;t have the key, do you, Ms. Noel?&quot;\n\n&quot;Is that all you want written in your testament?&quot;\n\nThe lady completely dropped her intellectual act \n\nand her attack was heated as Hell. Elegantly.\n\n* 5th fight - Roa\n\nAfter some troubles, Noel manages to escape the Toono mansion \n\nand comes face to face with a suspicious individual.\n\n&quot;Excuse me. You forgot to button up your shirt.&quot;\n\nThe suspicious man was insulted by the student&#39;s casual comment.\n\nHere&#39;s starts the battle with the suspicious moving at lightning speeds.\n\n* 6th fight - ??\n\n//Noel discovers the suspicious man was Roa and earns her happy ending. But...\n\n@Noel:\n\nIt&#39;s all over now?\n\nWhat? Really?\n\nI feel like something is wrong, something is missing...\n\nSince this is my story, the villain of the last chapter should be...\n\n//This is where she finally remembers Ciel.\n\n@Noel:\n\nI haven&#39;t seen her anywhere!\n\nEven if I&#39;m the main character of this word,\n\nwe can&#39;t have my story without her!\n\nNone of this had any point!\n\n@Student:\n\nSo, what are you trying to say here?\n\n@Noel:\n\nThat this is all fake!\n\nEven if my life here is happier than in the real world,\n\nand I got a great boyfriend in you!\n\nSomething is wrong!\n\nThis is not my world!\n\nI didn&#39;t even put any work into earning my heroine spot, to begin with!\n\nOh, no, no, I do want to be a heroine!\n\nBut that&#39;s a different matter!!\n\n@Student:\n\nYou&#39;re not making much sense.\n\nI can&#39;t see what you&#39;re getting at.\n\n@Noel:\n\nIt&#39;s a matter of feeling,\n\nno logic or interest involved!\n\nWe&#39;re breaking up!!\n\n@Student:\n\nThen I guess we must fight.\n\n-&gt; Battle against the student (if possible, give him different voice clips)\n\n-&gt; When she wins, do the classic &quot;they say goodbye as the world fades to white&quot; trope\n\n@Student:\n\nBye. Stay well.\n\nI know this is not your not your thing, but work as hard as you feel like you can.\n\n//Down to the last moment, Nanaya is always a cold but very caring younger boyfriend.\n\n//Noel is a bit sad but walks toward the light of awakening.\n\n//In the light, the students fades in the distance. And in the end,\n\n@Noel:\n\nOh, that&#39;s right. Why wasn&#39;t this the first thing I said?\n\nHEY! WHAT&#39;S YOUR NAME?\n\nTELL ME YOUR NAME BEFORE THIS IS OVER!\n\n//The students gives a discontent response as he walks away. \n\n//&quot;Saying that would ruin the mood.&quot; The screen turns white after he answers.\n\n*Epilogue\n\nEnding epilogue.\n\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div

was a priority.</p><p>Noel has many illuminating character moments in Tsukihime&#39;s story, but the most major and poorly conveyed point was the conversation in the underground lair in Ciel&#39;s route.</p><p>While feigning a half-crazed state, Noel questions Shiki if he was really going to go that far for a girl he didn&#39;t even know.</p><p>The reason why Shiki&#39;s answer put Noel at a momentary loss for words was because this forced her to see difference between him and the boy who was with her at that time.</p><p>The 14-year old girl wanted the boy she liked to have given her the same answer.</p><p>But since this could never happen, she embraced these ideal words with calm affection and gloomy jealousy.</p><p>This is a story that could have happened.</p><hr><h2

enjoying this series of hot days, people?</p><p>While it&#39;s still hot, it&#39;s still summer. September is summer. Swimsuits are summer. My point is, summer is coming.</p><p>It&#39;s right around the corner, just a wait bit longer for your ticket to paradise to be issued.</p><p>It&#39;ll be a wonderful summer where you&#39;ll get plentiful materials... No doubts about it... Seriously, I have no Grails. I can&#39;t even raise one Servant to 120. Gimme Grails!</p><p>(Those are the harmful effects of thoughtlessly raising every Servant he loved to 100)</p><p>And I&#39;m very glad to see you&#39;re all respecting Tsukihime&#39;s no spoilers period.</p><p>Thanks a bunch for preserving the joys of facing the unknown for the players who are still reading and the players who want to read but are too busy right now!</p><p>I&#39;d appreciate if you preserved this mood for one more week, talking about the game with your like-minded friends in your personal chat spaces, using Fusetter to talk about it in public spaces, etc.</p><p>Tsukihime is a visual novel, so the fun of it is not in moving your character, like it is in action games. Its plot is its life.</p><p>That&#39;s why I had to ask you not to post spoilers on these two weeks.</p><p>I must mention that we discussed the matter with Fusetter beforehand and they gladly offered their cooperation.</p><p>Thank you very much, Fuseta.</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Sorry for the abrupt change of topic but let&#39;s talk about the Solomon movie.</p><p>It&#39;s already been a month since the debut, so I&#39;ll give some little behind-the-scenes stories and exposition on the parts that were difficult to understand.</p><p>(I&#39;ll touch the plot without any vagueness, so if you haven&#39;t watched the movie yet, please skip this section)</p><p><strong>Seventh Heaven Mystic Code</strong></p><p>Each of those seven bolts were the exact amount of fuel (magical energy) for one Servant summon.</p><p>The wearer can do simple summons without it, but that would put a lot of stress on their body, so the safety breaker on the suit&#39;s chest restricts them into being unable to summon without using the bolts.</p><p>As long as the breaker is there, the wearer can use all the bolts and that won&#39;t interfere with their vital functions (because they&#39;ll stop summoning before it can).</p><p>In the Lev fight, when Lev pointed out that all systems that try to do the impossible have flaws and shot his magecraft, he was aiming at the breaker.</p><p>Fujimaru guarded it perfectly though.</p><p>And that&#39;s why Lev begrudgingly praised his &quot;competent imitation (of a warrior)&quot;.</p><p>Now to the Goetia fight.</p><p>By the time of the Throne Solomon fight, he had already used 6 bolts and was down to his last one.</p><p>Mash&#39;s shield protected Fujimaru and Chaldea. (Goetia&#39;s Noble Phantasm was, you know, aiming at the actual Chaldea base behind them)</p><p>The doctor comes to close the match.</p><p>It&#39;s a situation where Fujimaru has to look for a way to beat Goetia with the last summon, but thanks to his fond memories of Mash and Romani in the Singularities, the Master faces &quot;the most intense moment of his life&quot;.</p><p>No matter how ordinary and commonplace he is, as a person who passed Singularities 1 through 7, his boiling determination reflects his gratitude to everyone he met along the way and his pride of having survived that far.</p><p>The Master, as the one human standing there, recites the &quot;What is Human Order Security?&quot; speech Goetia got when he joined Chaldea&#39;s personnel... The first piece of flavor text the Masters got in FGO.</p><p>At the same time, instead of summoning from the bolt, he destroyed his own safety breaker and made the most daring move he could:</p><p>A new summoning spell consuming his entire being to safeguard Human Order.</p><p>In response to this sacrifice, all Heroic Spirits erased by Nega Summon appear again as a meteor shower covering the entire sky.</p><p>Goetia answered to Fujimaru&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s you and me now, Goetia&quot; with &quot;Then come, Chaldea&quot;.</p><p>He said &quot;come, Chaldea&quot; instead of &quot;Fujimaru&quot; because he accepted Fujimaru&#39;s will.</p><p>Fujimaru&#39;s will here being &quot;I&#39;m not defeating you. These Heroic Spirits were called by the merits and feelings of the Chaldea personnel that was already safeguarding Human Order long before I was born&quot;.</p><p>That&#39;s was I told Nobunaga during the recording, at least.</p><p>I told him that speech was a line Fujimaru always repeated to himself in his room during his daily training, with how unexperienced he considers himself to be.</p><p>Adding to that, Fujimaru said &quot;We of Chaldea...&quot; in the movie, but in the original draft, he was going to say &quot;They of Chaldea...&quot;.</p><p>During the first test recording, I requested Nobunaga to put a special feeling in this line. Quoting myself:</p><p>&quot;Fujimaru really wants to say &#39;we&#39; here. He wants to present himself as a proud member of Chaldea. But knowing how long the staff persevered before he got there, he can&#39;t include himself just one year after joining. &#39;It&#39;s not me defeating you. It&#39;s the fruit of the labors of everyone in Chaldea. I&#39;m just representing them.&#39;.&quot;</p><p>Respecting this request, he delivered a most wonderfully heartfelt &quot;They of Chaldea...&quot;</p><p>But seeing the whole scene confirmed that this intent is hard to convey in a movie, so we changed that into &quot;We of Chaldea&quot;.</p><p>And Shimazaki&#39;s perfectly delivered &quot;We&quot; convey the same nuance with opposite words. He was not the only one trying his hardest... Everyone in Chaldea was... What a wonderfully passionate performance.</p><p>When the studio first sent me this line, I thought to myself &quot;Oh... This Fujimaru can go beyond LB6.&quot; It was a heartwarming experience.</p><p>As you can tell, the Solomon movie has a lot of dialogue not present in the source material.</p><p>Many parts were cut for length, so I hope I can publish the raw script one day.</p><p>That&#39;s all I have to say about Time.</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Sorry for the even more abrupt change of topic but I&#39;ll advertise Tsukihime now.</p><p>It&#39;s been one week since launch.</p><p>I believe a lot of people must have already beat Arcueid&#39;s route by now.</p><p>If you did, check this out.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iTCUZxi9_c</p><p>A disc with all openings and endings in Tsukihime is coming out!</p><p>In September 1st! Real soon!</p><p>Every time I sent Kegani a request to compose an OP song, he also got the then-current version of the script to use in the songwriting.</p><p>These are the results.</p><p>Kegani&#39;s song and lyrics make me feel like he&#39;s now made of Tsukihime, and ReoNa&#39;s singing voice has the power and the emotion to reach inside the hollow moon. Combined, their songs are a delight...</p><p>Seimeisen in particular can only be described as Arcueid&#39;s route in song form.</p><p>The track has three verses, and the C hook is really got me thinking... &quot;Kegani, you really love Arc, don&#39;t you...? Are you trying to join the 27 Ancestors...?&quot;</p><p>The link has the trial version of all songs, so you&#39;ll only hear the A hook. If you&#39;re really interested, buy the disc and read the lyrics sheet while you listen.</p><p>With my creator privileges, I first listened to Seimeisen in early 2020, and listened to it on replay during the entire debug process for Arc&#39;s route.</p><p>As a result, I figured that a remix of Seimeisen was the only option for that scene in Arcueid&#39;s route and made urgent request for Kate to check Kegani&#39;s schedule. The extra request went well and that&#39;s how that moment got the way it was.</p><p>I&#39;d appreciate if you players who still haven&#39;t finished Arcueid&#39;s route would get your ears used to Seimeisen before the big moment.</p><p>That&#39;s all I have to say about the Moon.</p><hr><h2 id="_2021-8-12-untitled-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2021-8-12-untitled-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2021/8/12: Untitled. (Kinoko)</h2><p>Note: Contains LB6 Spoilers</p><p>It&#39;s been a week since the release of the Collapse Arc of Part 2, Chapter 6.</p><p>This has turned out to be the longest main chapter we&#39;ve published so far.</p><p>Once again, allow me to thank all of the development staff at DelightWorks,</p><p>the creators who designed the Servants and drew the backgrounds,</p><p>and of course, the staff of TYPE-MOON who for the past 3 months were like, &quot;We already knew this would happen, so what do you need us to do?&quot; and still put their heart and soul into making this happen.</p><p>It&#39;s been a grand dream, and it couldn&#39;t have come true without every single one of you.</p><p>Now, then. Since it seems like many players have completed the story, I&#39;ll spill a bunch of details even if it might be a bit early.</p><p>First, I know you&#39;re probably asking why I&#39;m calling it the Collapse Arc.</p><p>Chapter 6 was structured into three parts: the First Arc, Second Arc, and Collapse Arc.</p><p>During the stream right before the First Arc was released, it was compared to Kara no Kyoukai:</p><ul><li>First Arc: &quot;Garan no Dou&quot; from Kara no Kyoukai</li><li>Second Arc: &quot;Paradox Spiral&quot; from Kara no Kyoukai</li><li>Collapse Arc: &quot;A Study in Murder (II)&quot; from Kara no Kyoukai</li></ul><p>...are what was meant by that. The supposed final boss also similarly left the stage in medias res.</p><p>We intended to focus our resources on making the Collapse Arc, but the First and Second Arcs ballooned in volume,</p><p>and we kept making more and more assets and stills for them until all three arcs grew to be impactful on their own.</p><p>Also, I figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt to turn to the guy (company president) sitting next to me, whose hands were already full with the main work, and say,</p><p>&quot;I waNT BRidE poSES for Mash.</p><p>In TWO wEEks FRoM Now, IF yOU COuLD.</p><p>FOrGivE ME. foRgiVE mE. FoRgIVe me THE sInS OF kInoKo.&quot;</p><p>I sent that message using (physical) telepathy and in reply, he stunned me with entirely new portraits instead of just pose variations, and a huge amount of facial expressions too.</p><p>&quot;Well, that worked...</p><p>Maybe I could ask for the three fairies and Mike, too...</p><p>I&#39;ll ask BLACK-san to do the trio, and Simoshi-kun to work on Bogard!</p><p>Oh yeah, I can ask Shimoshi-kun to squeeze in Mike, too! They designed Da Vinci, after all!&quot;</p><p>And that&#39;s what we got.</p><p>In the plot, Mike was only to have a faceless mob fairy portrait, but I wanted him to leave more of an impression.</p><p>For Mike&#39;s design, I asked for &quot;lines that make him feel like a mob even though he&#39;s not. He shouldn&#39;t stand out during the First Arc, but it&#39;ll be really meaningful during the Collapse.&quot;</p><p>Thank you, Shimoshi! I&#39;m really looking forward to swimsuit Da Vinci-chan!</p><p>The musical score this time was nearly three times that of a typical main story chapter,</p><p>and KATE-kun fought until the very end to get that done.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d like individualized battle themes for each Fairy Knight.</p><p>The ____ in the Collapse Arc should have an arrangement of that... speaking of which, ____ should get the complete version.</p><p>Try to think of the Fairy Knight battles as only the starting skirmishes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm, hm. The motifs of Lancelot and Gawain are easy enough to understand, but what about Tristan?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A girl&#39;s hysterical thoughts. A blood-drenched stage. A dance musical, a brilliant stage, the girl herself is hell, something like that. In the style of CCC&#39;s Alter Ego battles.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Should I make ____&#39;s theme orchestral since it&#39;s a boss battle?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to. It&#39;s supposed to be a girl&#39;s happy (dancing) dream, so it should be a cheerful melody with some tempo. The stage is part of the climax, so it should enrapture the audience and make them wish they were happy to have been born! Or something like that. Think like, the most exciting moment of your life. Even if it was all a dream.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s why the stage spins round and round! I get it now! But can I say something? Why are you giving me such an awful job?&quot;</p><p>By the way, speaking of the track &quot;Land of Hope,&quot; it&#39;s actually the initial map theme that was submitted for Saber Wars 2.</p><p>When KATE-kun gave it to us, I thought it would be too perfect for the end of Chapter 6, so I said,</p><p>&quot;I want to use this in Chapter 6, so please keep this one under wraps for now.</p><p>I think we should arrange it for Castoria&#39;s Noble Phantasm; give the players a taste of it so it&#39;ll sound familiar to them.</p><p>At the very very end, I want to use an emotional arrangement of it. Thanks.&quot;</p><p>And that&#39;s how, for the past 2 years, I&#39;ve listening to &quot;Land of Hope&quot; and thinking about Spring Memories whenever I was moving around.</p><p>To me, that song is about seeking stars.</p><p>Okay, at this point people are going to start accusing me of rambling too much again, so I&#39;ll explain a bunch of trivia off the top of my head.</p><h3 id="more-lb6-story-trivia" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#more-lb6-story-trivia" aria-hidden="true">#</a> More LB6 Story Trivia</h3><p><strong>____ in the Garden of Lost Will</strong></p><p>Regarding [the name of the imprisoned] in the Garden of Lost Will, the person that appears at the end is generally a person that you unconsciously feel is pointing out &quot;the very hardest thing, the first thing that you yourself avoid confronting.&quot;</p><p>The Oberon that shows up at the end isn&#39;t the real one.</p><p><strong>Vivian of Orkney</strong></p><p>The leader of the Rain Clan recognized their sins and offered the Fairy of Paradise their love and affection.</p><p>These were Vivian&#39;s warm childhood days.</p><p>A dimly lit yet warm castle sunroom, where the rain never stops.</p><p>The girl dreamed of a fairytale-like kingdom where she had no duty to Avalon, where everyone could live in peace.</p><p><strong>Caster of Avalon</strong></p><p>Caster has no Spring Memories because, as the Fairy of Paradise, she had no fun memories to look back on. She wasn&#39;t allowed to have any.</p><p>But, Vivian might have experienced the same thing if she had returned to Paradise.</p><p>Still, Morgan had her memories of being lovingly raised in Orkney,</p><p>while Artoria had her memories of meeting her very first... traveling companions (friends), who had nothing to do with her duty as the Fairy of Paradise.</p><p><strong>Oberon&#39;s Retrospection</strong></p><p>The person narrating Oberon&#39;s origins in Verse 30 is A.A.</p><p>Oberon is the one talking during the parts about day and night, &quot;can you understand how ~~~ feels?&quot;</p><p>but the third-person narration afterward is A.A. after becoming the Guardian of the Holy Swords and learning everything about Britain.</p><p><strong>The Star in the Hole</strong></p><p>There&#39;s a scene in verse 30 about the Star in the Storm.</p><p>That was her final sprint, in the moment she vanished from the throne and became a Guardian.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve hit my goal if I just quit thinking and be a ____, right? If I keep trying, then they&#39;ll keep me working forever and ever, won&#39;t they?&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s the choice she made after asking herself that question.</p><p>And the result, as you can see, was space-time jumping shenanigans.</p><p><strong>Merlin</strong></p><p>If this guy ever teaches you magic, it&#39;ll only be in your dreams.</p><p>I know this sounds cruel, but to Merlin, the only Artoria is the King of Knights.</p><p><strong>About those red-colored choices</strong></p><p>It isn&#39;t the case that either one of the answers is correct.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to have a big schism where the reader keeps noticing things that the protagonist doesn&#39;t.</p><p>So, all I did was make your choices have a tangible result in the end, if earlier in the story you thought, &quot;wait, that doesn&#39;t sound right&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s not really it, is it?&quot;.</p><p>I colored them red to make that easier to understand, but I picked the color red to make it a bit more ominous, too...</p><p><strong>Oberon&#39;s Final Readvent</strong></p><p>I also leveled Oberon up to his final form last night, and I had them stop the ascension fanfare from playing while he says his line. I think the late-night update on the 11th patched that in.</p><p>&quot;More importantly, why does my flavor text suddenly change after bond 6? Why, I wonder? Why do you think? Make sure you read the prince&#39;s flavor text before then, okay?\u2606&quot;</p><p><strong>By the way, regarding his remarks to Nursery Rhyme:</strong></p><p>With a smile, he offers, &quot;After those ____ and readers are gone, why don&#39;t we find a nice, quiet world where everyone&#39;s perspective is equally important, and have a tea party together?&quot;</p><p>To which she gently smiles and declares, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, my wonderful prince. But, I love to see all of our readers radiant and happy.&quot;</p><p>As he watches her turn to leave, he would reply &quot;yeah, go figure&quot; with a sardonic laugh and narrowed eyes.</p><p>Some final notes on the chronology</p><h3 id="more-lb6-chronology-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#more-lb6-chronology-notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> More LB6 Chronology Notes</h3><p><strong>1000 B.C.</strong></p><p>A Returned A-Ray is born among the Fang Clan - Wryneck the Brave, inheritor of organs of the waste heat of the planet.</p><p><strong>800 B.C.</strong></p><p>Tonelico fights and triumphs over Waste Heat Lord Wryneck.

Tsukihime - A Piece of Blue Glass Moon, the one and only Tsukihime Remake, comes on August 26th.</p><p>http://typemoon.com/products/tsukihime/</p><p>I gave it my current max. The trailers are available on this website, so check them when you have the time. Captions aside, all screenshots in the trailers are from the final version of game. Assume the screen composition will be like that all the time.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Hello again. It&#39;s been two weeks since the release of chapter 6 part 2. We still have one week until the ending, but I want you to put that aside for a moment to prepare for the daily festivals.</p><p>Yes. The Fate/Grand Order Fes 2021 started.</p><p>Even if we can&#39;t do a IRL event, we still have the internet...! I think having these intense shows every day can get a bit heavy, but I hope you enjoy these 6 days of 6th anniversary.</p><p>I&#39;ll participate in the Fes only as a regular FGO player. I know the titles of each project but nothing beyond that. (...because producing chapter 6... took me a lot of time...)</p><p>Despite thinking the Grand Exam is an insane idea, I&#39;m taking the challenge. I don&#39;t think I can get a 100/100, but a 90/100 sounds doable. That&#39;s the creator of this franchise talking.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Grand Temple of Time: Solomon.</p><p>I got to watch the movie before everyone else. I just have one brief comment.</p><p>Everything I wanted to see was there!</p><p>The screenplay had a special format (Nasu writing the full story first and then they adapting that into a proper movie script), so some scenes were obviously omitted due to time constraints, but the final product was a movie good enough to make those cuts not matter in the bigger picture. It successfully adapted the game into a movie through a different approach from the Camelot movies. Not only that, but it also became a 90 minute traditional blockbuster everyone should watch. Anyways! Everyone who beat Part 1 needs to give it a try! Really!</p><p>The first 7 Singularities were missions to explore and return alive, but the Final Singularity is a mission to exterminate and win. The need to prioritize the Master&#39;s life is no longer applying. The Master uses his body and Magic Circuits to become a Servant-summoning weapon even if it kills him...</p><p>This is Fujimaru Ritsuka&#39;s role in the Final Singularity and Chaldea&#39;s responsibility in preserving Human Order. Chaldea was supposed to be a research facility but had to operate as an army for one year out of necessity. Make sure you don&#39;t miss their final mission.</p><p>The movie really made me wish you were required to watch it before you played the Garden of Lost Will in chapter 6 part 2.</p><p>Oh, by the way, the official English names for the &quot;saccharine dream&quot;, &quot;dusky abyss&quot;, &quot;despondency&quot;, and &quot;those without sin&quot; are New Home, Horizon, Lost Will, and Heavenly, respectively. &quot;Heavenly&quot; being from the scene where Merlin gets trapped.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Note: Contains LB6 Spoilers</p><p>Since we already got in the subject of chapter 6, time for some inside stories. One of the authors who inspired Nasu to write his doujins was CHOCO, Fairy Knight Lancelot&#39;s designer. I can never forget 1999. Takeuchi said &quot;Doujins come in all shapes and forms. Take a look at this one.&quot;, and showed me his thickest book, CHOCOLATE GEOMETRY #0002. It was a shining star even for today&#39;s standards of quality, and it taught the young Nasu that there were a multitude of wonderful doujin magazines he didn&#39;t know about. Still, this volume was my own fateful encounter. The cover forced anyone to admit it had a high level of artistry and composition. Uncompromised design, stunning visuals, and refined book design... Everything about it shattered my views about the differences being pro and amateur. It was an astonishing accomplishment for the Nasu from the ages before internet, before computers, and when the closest convenience store was a 30 minute walk away.</p><p>&quot;If people can make books this good and have a place to distribute them, I want to see what I can do.&quot;</p><p>CHOCO&#39;s earnestness encouraged me when was somewhat skeptical about doujin activity. After that, my luck and my bonds blessed me with the opportunity to produce a game, and I spent the whole process dreaming of one day working with CHOCO, my dear father... And as usual, my bonds blessed me. I was having lunch with MahoHako&#39;s designer Imaizumi, when he suddenly dropped a &quot;I have CHOCO&#39;s number&quot;.</p><p>&quot;What... No way... (thunk)... But I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s busy with Xenoblade Chronicles 2 right now... Despite everything, I&#39;m an industry insider, so I know how things go... I want to meet him... I want to hire him... I want to make this long-standing dream come true... But I also don&#39;t want to meet him because I&#39;m fangirling too much... I want to watch him from a distance...&quot;</p><p>After about 6 seconds of fan anxiety, I took action and asked Imaizumi to introduce me because I wanted to hire him. Yes. That&#39;s how life goes. Opportunities never last forever. Throw away your shame and honor and eat the carrot dangling in front of you. That&#39;s the story of how I connected myself to CHOCO, my dear father.</p><p>&quot;Fate has this dragon named Albion, and she has to look like she&#39;s the one thing that doesn&#39;t belong to that world. Something like a sci-fi character in a fantasy land, perhaps. Like really out of place, really extraneous.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Could you be more specific. How extraneous, exactly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm, if every other character were Mobile Suits, this one is a Getter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Got it. Just to make sure, you&#39;re the real Kinoko Nasu and I will design a Fate/ Servant, right?&quot;</p><p>Lancelot started from this explanation. A few years later, I was finally set to start producing chapter 6, and I could request the long-waited CHOCO design. I want to take this moment to thank CHOCO for cheerfully accepting my unreasonable requests, and Imaizumi for tying us together. By the way, when I request a FGO Servant design, I take a lot of ideas from the illustrator. This includes ideas for weapons, facial expressions, dialogue, and Noble Phantasms. In Lancelot&#39;s case, I took CHOCO&#39;s ideas for all the things I just listed, but the finest example of this comes from his NP image boards. Lancelot&#39;s 3rd Ascension NP had already achieved perfect beauty since the earlies design stages.</p><p>\u25C6</p><h3 id="lb6-part-2-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lb6-part-2-notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> LB6 Part 2 Notes</h3><p>Whew, that was long. Here are some quick chapter 6 bits that had to be kept out of the final script.</p><ul><li>Beryl&#39;s Command Spells:</li></ul><p>Beryl didn&#39;t use his Command Spells on Tristan. They didn&#39;t have a proper Servant contract, after all. For special character reasons, Beryl can use Command Spells on himself, and was planned to do so in the Black Wolf fight. But that had to be scrapped... for programming difficulties... We even got the voice lines recorded...</p><ul><li>The cause of Woodwose&#39;s death:</li></ul><p>The CG didn&#39;t make it clear enough, but Woodwose was finished off by Morgan&#39;s magecraft dagger. After taking a hit she could dodge from Woodwose, she realized it was too late for him (he was turning into Mohs) and stabbed his abdomen with a point-blank dagger. That&#39;s what that stab sound effect was about. Later, figuring out everything Morgan did, he regained his senses but became Mohs. Here he was supposed to aimless attack everything like normal Mohs do, but his love and respect to Morgan... his heartfelt sense of guilt and repentance... freed him from the Mohs curse and allowed him to vanish without violence.</p><ul><li>FGO Radio - Nemo&#39;s secret:</li></ul><p>Don&#39;t tell anyone, but here&#39;s what I wrote for the original version of Nemo&#39;s Valentine&#39;s scene.</p><p>Nemo Marine D: &quot;Really?!

Let\u2019s get into the main topic.</p><p>Oberon. Umino Chika.</p><p>I\u2019m sure everyone is aware of \u201CHoney and Clover\u201D and \u201CMarch comes like a lion\u201D, right?</p><p>For those who are, I&#39;m sure explaining won\u2019t be necessary at this point.</p><p>For those fortunate enough to not have encountered them I won\u2019t say anything mean, just please get running to the bookstore right now.</p><p>Whichever one of the two is fine. Though if possible I\u2019d like you to start reading from \u201CHoney and Clover\u201D.</p><p>Umino Chika&#39;s manga contain all the trials and tribulations of (a nerd\u2019s) life. They are simply fun, charming, enviable, heartrending, bitter and sad... but also inspiring.</p><p>Thinking back to it, it was 3 years ago, after an FGO livestream (Surprise Birthday).</p><p>It was the first time I talked to this scary fellow wearing sunglasses and a leather jacket in the flesh.</p><p>\u201CHm, this scary dude, he\u2019s totally nice... practically a master at thoughtfulness...</p><p>Also... his eyes... are kinda beautiful... (heart racing) not that I can see them\u2026</p><p>He really loves games... and can talk about Chrono Trigger all legit... damn dude\u2026\u201D</p><p>Before I&#39;d noticed, almost 2 hours of intense conversation had passed. Though we split up as the it was around time for the last trains of the day, we did manage to talk about \u201CHoney and Clover\u201D at this point.</p><p>For me, \u201CHoney and Clover\u201D is a very important work.</p><p>I can\u2019t simply categorize it as an interesting work.</p><p>It&#39;s one of the mental pillars of support that lets me work hard when I\u2019m struggling with my creativity.</p><p>(I get a little choked up at the episodes where Hagu is making things on all her lonesome)</p><p>Mafia: \u201CIf that\u2019s that case, then how about meeting her? I might be able to set up a meeting.\u201D</p><p>What do you mean \u2018if that\u2019s the case\u2019, Muramasaaaaa!</p><p>He hit me with a direct attack out of the blue, as if he\u2019d be ready to charge in right there and then.</p><p>And with that, before I knew what was happening, I&#39;d managed to meet with Umino Chika, as blessed by fate as I was.</p><p>I talked\u2026 a lot.</p><p>I splurted out 20 years of all my thoughts onto her.</p><p>\u201CI&#39;ve been a fan since CUTiEcomic. I created this game called Tsukihime and then when we have the fandisk for it one of our staff-members called OKSG introduced me to this one manga, saying it would totally be up my alley and so I fell in love at first sight (volume). And with that, I looked around the bookstores for the previous magazines and managed to enjoy myself up to volume 2 but then the magazine it was published in was suspended... I mean what the heck\u2026! As I despaired, it restarted serialization in YOUNG YOU and so out of sheer happiness, the three of us - me, OKSG and Takeuchi - went drinking while talking through how beautiful the world was. Humanity was alright after all. Yamada is so beautiful. Seeing as I am a wordsmith, I poured my attention over the line delivery and the monologues, like man Chika\u2019s monologues are just so... keen... and heart-wrenching\u2026 yet so sincere and vulnerable, you write it so beautifully I\u2019m afraid my heart as a creator is gonna break, it\u2019s like your words as sharp as a knife powered up into words as sharp as a katana with \u201CMarch comes like a lion\u201D, I mean really take care of yourself... Still\u2026 I wanna see how it the continues, I want Shizuku to become happier than ever before! (snip) Perhaps one day we could work together on something... even if it gets me killed...&quot;</p><p>\u201COkay~ (warm smile). It might be a bit inconvenient as making adjustments to my schedule is quite difficult right now.&quot;</p><p>That\u2019s no inconvenience at all, Muramasaaaaa!</p><p>That was around the time FGO Part 2 was starting.</p><p>It was already decided that Chapter 6 would be my responsibility so in my head I was just like,</p><p>\u201COberon... Oberon! I\u2019m gonna ask her for Oberon.</p><p>I\u2019m gonna have Umino Chika draw me a fairy-tale character.</p><p>Is it okay to be this happy? It\u2019s not.</p><p>Are you telling me this kinda chance happened in my lifetime? It seems so.</p><p>Oooooooohhhhhhh, Oberooooooooooooooon!\u201D</p><p>It was nothing but that, essentially.</p><p>And so Umino said</p><p>\u201COh Chapter 6 is going to be a fairy world you say? I wanna draw a cute girl\u2606\u201D</p><p>While cackling and giggling to herself... but...</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s... a male character...</p><p>I want the kind of... this and that... of a Umino character... with that kinda blunt expression\u2026\u201D</p><p>And so I destroyed the dreams of an innocent little girl in all but 3 seconds. I apologize.</p><p>And with that, I had decided on how Oberon was to be introduced.</p><p>The instant the offer of Oberon went through, the way he was to be depicted had already been decided inside of me.</p><p>\u201CSomeone with a different presence from the usual Servant.</p><p>A guide to this fairy-tale world, who embodies the themes of Chapter 6.\u201D</p><p>In order to carry out this concept I also requested this from Umino:</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s no need to try and fit in with FGO\u2019s style. In Britain, I want Umino Chika\u2019s drawings to be just as they are.\u201D</p><p>And with that selfish request, Umino came back to me like a blazing fastball.</p><p>Though she was so, so busy, she arduously adjusted her schedule and lent us her help.</p><p>So I once again offer my gratitude to you, Umino.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>It was the work that gave me strength as I was making the original Tsukihime.</p><p>That I could work together with its creator, and also</p><p>that it could be released in the same year as when Tsukihime R is being sold,</p><p>I really makes me feel like my life has become quite good... still...</p><p>There\u2019s actually one more person in Chapter 6 who I\u2019ve admired ever since the original Tsukihime\u2019s production.</p><p>Or rather, one of the creators who served as the impetus for its creation is joining us now.</p><p>\u201CIs this really a doujinshi!? It\u2019s so big, cute and cool\u2026!</p><p>To think there is a person who\u2019d put out such a book on all their own...!\u201D</p><p>This is already ages ago, I\u2019m talking around the year 2000.</p><p>When the latter part of Chapter 6 is released I\u2019ll talk about this once more.</p><hr><h2 id="_2021-5-13-showing-gratitude-as-a-representative-of-the-round-table-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2021-5-13-showing-gratitude-as-a-representative-of-the-round-table-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2021/5/13: Showing gratitude, as a representative of the Round Table (Kinoko)</h2><p>Long time no see.</p><p>I&#39;m back from a private showing of the second Camelot movie.</p><p>What a freaking masterpiece.</p><p>The first Camelot did as good as it could on its mandated role of providing the bare minimum explanations on what FGO is about, but other hand, it had to keep its momentum and flash on the low side, among other problems, all caused by the larger problem of the swirl of Corona messing the entire production schedule... (Thank you to the entire staff, including the director, for holding on until the very end...) With all that happened, I think the movie managed to shift into the second gear but never get to the third.</p><p>The moment the baton is passed to the second Camelot, things get ghastly.</p><p>90 minutes of pure &quot;The prequel already all the base exposition. Now it&#39;s we just run with a nonstop sequence of all the scenes everyone was wanting to see.&quot;</p><p>And they did it right. Every single was done with refined taste &amp; super quality...!</p><p>Everyone who played the game will go there thinking &quot;I want to see this scene&quot; and watch a scene 100 times better.</p><p>Despite my initial shock at their bold decisions on what to cut from the story, but on the first 5 minutes it already hit me that they cut all that because the viewer would be able to imagine what happened off-screen, and because they had a lot better things to show instead.</p><p>It&#39;s a huge sequence of scenes I wanted see, they exact way I wanted too see them from start to finish, but the real amazing part is the last 60 minutes. The war in the holy city.</p><p>They look good. All of them look good.</p><p>(Every character was highly reflective of their original designer&#39;s artstyle. To an almost uncanny level with Tristan in particular. I couldn&#39;t believe they could reproduce the complicated delicated of a Morii character)</p><p>On top of that, they&#39;re in a constant sequence of high-octane scenes that leave you with no room to breathe.</p><p>They go all out with the flashiness, but an earnest devotion to the original tone, without ever forgetting the main focus of the plot.</p><p>My honest opinion is that <strong>the entire movie is a theme park where you to an exciting new attraction every 5 minutes and pretty much every attraction feels like the main attraction,</strong> but if I had to pick just one, it&#39;d be the final battle against the Lion King.</p><p>The dialogue confronting the Lion King was <em>scripted so specifically for the game format</em> that I honestly had already given up on the idea of <em>finding a way to make that look good in the movie.</em> And yet, their fantastic direction and cinematography managed to <strong>materialize the excitement of playing the game.</strong></p><p>They did better than the game, to an extent, even.</p><p>As someone who has been following Arthuria since /stay Night, all I can say about the Lion King fight is... &quot;I saw something beautiful.&quot;</p><p>A spoiler warning here... although people who didn&#39;t watch it wouldn&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about.</p><p>No line in the Lion King fight&#39;s script says &quot;This scene goes with this image.&quot;</p><p>That means all the beauty of the that fight comes from the raw power of the director and the animation staff (the director personally storyboarded this one!).</p><p>All his creativity and the good sense necessary to make it real!

All kept in strict conformance with the original.</p><p>The PSP version of /EXTRA was a story structured the way it was because it was a RPG.</p><p>That&#39;s why I gave Record the role of being a visually improved /EXTRA and composed the anime adaptation as something different, an what-if that could never be same as its source.</p><p>A good x years back, /EXTRA&#39;s remake was first planned alongside the /EXTRA anime.</p><p>Ideally, they&#39;d both be released at the same time, but... well, a lot happened, including it taking a lot of time to talk about it with all the related parties and FGO eating up more of Type-Moon&#39;s time than anyone could&#39;ve imagined, so well, you&#39;ve seen the results.</p><p>But thanks to these circumstances, we managed to announce Record just in time for this joyous /EXTRA 10th anniversary.</p><p>Studio BB is completely in charge of creating the gameplay and making any changes to the continuity they find necessary. My only involvement in the remake is supervising the very few new strings of text they&#39;re adding to the original script.</p><p>I&#39;m constantly getting news about the new gameplay, what&#39;s happening in the game, the design sheets of the Master and Servants redesigned into a more 2020 style, etc (although I still hold the designs from 10 years ago very dear to me).</p><p>I&#39;m already extremely emotional about this, but the best is yet to come.</p><p>I&#39;m looking forward to the the new Fate/EXTRA Record, revived by Kazuya Niinou and the BB Staff, as much as you are!</p><p>But damn, I wasn&#39;t expecting to see those development screens on the livestream.

Having shilled some of the things I like I feel a bit better. From hereon I\u2019m gonna talk about work.</p><p>One week has passed since the release of the latter half of FGO Chapter 5, Olympus.</p><p>I think there\u2019s a high amount of players who have beaten it so I think I wanna do some small talk about it, spoilers included.</p><p>I referenced this in an interview but up to Chapter 1~5 I asked each writer to do the lore of their lostbelt.</p><p>I had them each freely consider and create a \u2018what-if world\u2019 with the theme of \u2018a dead end human history different from ours\u2019 in mind.</p><p>Still, even within these, Olympus has connections with Extra.</p><p>\u201CWithin TYPE-MOON\u2019s mythos, the source of the Gods of Olympus are a migratory fleet from outer space (only machines) who built Atlantis.\u201D</p><p>So with just those words set in stone, and with it as a model I had their respective writers think of each Machine-God\u2019s background setting.</p><p>The background setting of having each respective god\u2019s Authority be their function/role required for interstellar travel was an unorthodox element as one might expect. I think it lent the presence of an unusual enemy, something never before seen in Fate.</p><p>Having received these background settings, I-IV did the design drafts of the Machine-Gods, and then DW did the designs and animations.</p><p>Machine-God Ares\u2019 design was done by Huke on account of his connection to Altera, with it being the Divine Core that crossed over to Rome and all.</p><p>He&#39;s got an orthodox approach different from the 12 Machine-Gods of Olympus, rustic and militaristic, on top of being stylish and super cool...!</p><p>I\u2019m sure there were many players who didn\u2019t notice that you could use him as a type of Master Skill during the final battle.</p><p>That war-god can, because of my own little request, hit Zeus up and down, and remove his dumb annoying defense buffs, you know?</p><p>Great Full Armor - Kumano was designed by RAITA, on account of his connections with Kintoki.</p><p>Black Barrel - Round was designed by Hirai Yukio, who we are much indebted to for his work on Shadow Border, among others.</p><p>They were not able to sortie onto the battle screen but both were wonderful designs. Thanks as always!</p><p>Well then. Let&#39;s talk about this &quot;Greece arc&quot; then.</p><p>As usual, the Chapter writer\u2019s role was everything from the landing and until the defeat of the Lostbelt King, as before.</p><p>My role then was taking that and doing general re-writes, adding the introduction and ending - the plot details and stories that bridge the Chapters and so on.</p><p>Still, this time around I was also allowed to participate as a writer.</p><p>The climax of Part 2\u2019s turning point... As it\u2019s the script where the story of the Crypters briefly comes to an end, that final conclusion is the duty of the script supervisor.</p><p>That\u2019s right. Olympus was the end of the Crypter arc.</p><p>(The truth of the Crypters has yet to be revealed but what I mean is that they\u2019ve been released from their roles as the current enemy)</p><p>What in Part 1 was Chapter 4, around the point when Soloman appears.</p><p>Chaldea\u2019s journey still has a ways to go, so I\u2019d like it if you&#39;d think of it as their direction changing a bit.</p><blockquote><p>The Alien God who has finally revealed itself (?).</p><p>The mischievous Disciples who have started doing whatever they feel like.</p><p>The remaining Crypters. The two remaining Lostbelts.</p><p>The records of Bluebook.</p><p>What exactly lies past the Wiped Blank Earth?</p><p>As always, please look forward to more \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D</p></blockquote><hr><p>Right, from hereon I\u2019ll talk behind-the-scenes for some characters I\u2019ve hand-picked.</p><ul><li>Caenis</li></ul><p>It\u2019s been two years since their appearance in Part 2\u2019s Opening Animation. Our Mr. Ms. Caenis has finally been added!</p><p>...Caenis was actually delivered to us in 2015, so we\u2019re not even talking about before the start of Part 2, in fact this illustration has been here since Part 1. Among the FGO characters, they&#39;re actually part of the old-timer gang, rivaling Red Hare.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry for making you wait so long, Azusa! Not only did you wait so long with a smile on your face, but also happily undertook some sprite additions in the eleventh hour. My greatest thanks to you...!</p><p>I left the background setting of Caenis to the other writers but</p><p>They were a servant of a special pattern, as I took charge of them within each script.</p><p>As their relationship with Kirschtaria was an element that spans across the various Chapters, it&#39;s true that only I, being the general supervisor, could do it.</p><p>As for this crude and violent Caenis, I think you can guess at their true feelings now that you know their conclusion and can look back.</p><p>This was especially strong when they lost during Atlantis. Who was it they could not afford dying because of?</p><p>Caenis\u2019 screams were not a plea for their life, but rather a plea in order to save him.</p><p>Also, I had to have some exclusive lines for the last battle and so after testing the waters in asking for a supplementary recording session, it turned out we were blessed by the voice actors schedule being open and got an OK!</p><p>In that sense, a super luxurious Servant. Hey, are you really a 4-star?</p><hr><ul><li>Kirschtaria</li></ul><p>Everyone&#39;s favorite apple-providing bigger brother.</p><p>Why did he introduce himself when the earth was Blank Slated in the Prologue with \u201CI am Kirschtaria Wodime\u201D?</p><p>I mean usually at that point there\u2019d be no need to do so.</p><p>Putting aside that he\u2019d basically already secured victory, it goes without saying that remaining anonymous would be to his advantage with his greatest enemy in Chaldea still remaining.</p><p>Yet, Kirschtaria did not do so.</p><p>That was a declaration of intent concerning the Editing of Human Order, and also a proclamation for the purpose of making it clear that the responsibility of destroying Pan Human History laid with him.</p><p>Also, the reason why Kirschtaria\u2019s 6th and 7th skill are like that is because,</p><p>\u201CBeyond there I was always alone\u201D and</p><p>\u201CThere were no memories sufficient in supporting my body from my journey there.\u201D</p><hr><ul><li>Pino (the boy under the bridge)</li></ul><p>Pino is a moniker that I secretly added as I was writing. This name does not appear in the main story.</p><p>I asked Takenashi Eri to do the design and sprites. Indeed, I used my connections to the fullest!</p><p>Someone who doesn\u2019t give off a presence of more than just a background character, fundamentally creepy and menial, yet that final expression...</p><p>A character with a very difficult, yet important role, and so I just had to get Takenashi\u2019s touch.</p><hr><ul><li>U - Olga Marie -</li></ul><p>Sorry for keeping you waiting. So we have finally arrived here.</p><p>The U is the U of Ultra.</p><p>\u201CIf - just what if - I turned into a being that rules over the earth, then what title would I give myself\u2026?</p><p>Super... Hybrid... No, not that, it\u2019s gotta be Ultra, right!\u201D</p><p>Whether she thought this or not is unclear, but I at least think it\u2019s entirely possible.</p><p>(Look it up)</p><p>So I requested for her design to be ultra monster-ish. No, not that kinda ultra.</p><p>Also, that single sword stroke was the end of Muramasa\u2019s job, and so that appearance comes from her own disposition.</p><p>\u201CSeems I got some more work to do\u201D as per Muramasa.</p><hr><ul><li>The protagonist\u2019s feelings.</li></ul><p>During the latter half, from the part where you hear about Kirschtaria from Pepe (about them being equals, both in terms of ability and circumstances) a spark lights up in the protagonist\u2019s feelings, becoming one of fighting, rather than one of restoring.</p><p>With the words imparted as the team-up with Caenis ended after the battle with Chaos, this spark has clearly erupted into a flame, going from fighting for the sake of the Human Order, to wanting to beat Kirschtaria as a fellow Master.</p><p>In being recognized more so than anyone else by an opponent who they thought they had no chance against, they can give it their all more so than ever.</p><p>This loosened the protagonist\u2019s heart who previously fearfully froze up thinking they had to repair the Human Order, to now being returned to the same state as in the finale of Part 1 of just wanting to defeat what&#39;s in front of them, with all their might.</p><p>They believed in themselves, for the sake of someone who believed in them more than they did.</p><p>With that in mind, I requested that the battle with Kirschtaria in Atlantis be balanced not as to be an overwhelming show of power, but one strong enough where it\u2019s winnable if the players pulled out their everything so they\u2019d feel like \u201Cdamn, he\u2019s strong, but this is it!\u201D.</p><p>So when players who really managed to win popped up I smiled in satisfaction, while also thinking \u201C3 turning it is overdoing it, Medb!\u201D</p><p>So. At the time, there was a Kirschtaria defeat voice-line just in case of players winning but I decided to scrap it as it would give away Kirschtaria\u2019s true nature if used in Atlantis.</p><p>It\u2019s not much but I present this to those of you who have beaten Olympus.</p><p>(I&#39;ve already gotten permission from DW)</p>', 766);

It turned out to be another manuscript packed with lines, but through the abilities of storyboarder Takao and director Akai it turned out just suuuuuper emotional\u2026 and interesting... reborn into a wonderful animated piece.</p><p>I think my feelings after seeing the completed episode 0 were the same as everyone else at the venue.</p><p>Kind of a gradually emerging warmth like, man... we sure went through a great journey coming all the way here.</p><p>Nonetheless, only episode 0 min-maxed into being emotional.</p><p>From episode 1, it will start as just purely \u201Cgreedy entertainment\u201D.</p><p>I think it was almost unilaterally conveyed from episode 0 just how much all of the anime staff love the main story of FGO and so from that, please look forward to the broadcast starting in October.</p><p>Of course, not just to Chapter 7, but also to \u201CDivine Realm of the Round Table Camelot - Theatrical Edition\u201D as well.</p><p>Chapter 6\u2019s production is also proceeding smoothly, with the material I receive meant for supervision being wonderful, with a quality worthy of the movie medium.</p><p>This is coming out after Chapter 7, so I cannot provide any information about it but, it\u2019d be great if you could look forward to it all the same.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>By the way, about Gawain\u2019s Nightless Charisma.</p><p>Please think of it as\u2026 the result of him having the Gift given to him by the Lion King and what happened in the holy land inscribed into his Saint Graph.</p><p>He did not abandon his sins.</p><hr><h2 id="_2019-5-16-untitled-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2019-5-16-untitled-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2019/5/16: Untitled (Kinoko)</h2><p>The second mystery-festival, \u201CA Meihousou Most Foul\u201D, has started!

If you\u2019re asking why we\u2019re using this kind of method its because we want to further employ the differences between the novel version and the game version.</p><p>If I am to give a concrete example as to what part is different then...</p><ul><li>In the novel (original) version, the starting requirements were having arrived at Part 2 Chapter 3 (SIN).</li></ul><p>In order to make the requirements for playing a bit broader, us on the writing team decided to change it to Part 1.</p><p>To go with this change, we had to swap out a certain character with a different one. The swapped in character\u2019s role and text was given as Nasu\u2019s responsibility.</p><ul><li>As there weren\u2019t just scenes from within the play this time around, the other servants that appear were supervised and rewritten by their respective writers.</li></ul><p>Something like that.</p><p>By changing the starting requirements, the character of the script changed but the atmosphere and logic of the original is still the same.</p><p>I hope you\u2019ll wholeheartedly enjoy the 7 days of this thinking game.</p><p>\u201CUh, that\u2019s good and all but isn\u2019t there something out of place?

This here is a game where the simple answer to that question is contained.</p><p>Console games are a way of intervening in another world on your own initiative.</p><p>How do you collect the texts contained within it, and how do you build up the story? That kind of elements is a type of enjoyment not present within either movies or novels.</p><p>There&#39;s something highly enjoyable about the moment when there&#39;s a conclusive, yet natural payoff to this build up.</p><p>This wonderful game achieves not only that enjoyment of the revelation that, wow everything is connected, but also takes the current limitations of VR - where something is right in front of you but you can&#39;t touch it, or not being able to talk despite being right there, basically only being able to just shake your hands - and implements as something core to the story.</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna talk about the contents of the game, as that&#39;d be spoilers but either way, it was a beautiful story.

Please watch over me warmly.</p><p>I have nothing more to add for the Xmas event that finished without any troubles, but I will answer the unexplained question of &quot;Why was there a Xmas boom happening?&quot;.</p><p>At that time, the Underworld had the gates closed by malice and traveling into it was impossible.</p><p>So we should assume there was someone, a specialist of the underworld, who modded the rule of &quot;If you give a sacrifice (or the equivalent), the gates will open&quot;, spread the concept of xmas, and invited Santa Claus, right?</p><p>Yes.

While I can destroy my enemies alone, I cannot perform the Holy Selection. I need knights that will become my hands and feet. However. I understand that this act violates your beliefs.

Look, Helena-kun, the stars are out tonight! By the way, Helena-kun, what do you think of the Nazca Lines?&quot;</p><p>Olcott-kun was really hig- I mean, he was drunk.</p><p>He was frolicking about like a child while he started to draw a crop circle. I let him be because I&#39;d already gotten used to how weird Edison and Bell were.</p><p>&quot;Why don&#39;t you try shooting a beam for an instant at the lower part here? Look, doesn&#39;t it look like a titan of light? Maybe this is the Hierarchy you saw, Helena-kun. By the way, what&#39;s this silver disc hovering above my head?&quot;</p><p>Lemuria! (definition: I done goofed!)</p><p>It was all over when, sensing danger, I reached for my coat.</p><p>I lost consciousness to a dazzling light, and when I woke up I was lying on a bed with white sheets.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t freely move.</p><p>But I knew how to take advantage of the situation. It&#39;s gotta be my sixth sense.</p><p>&quot;Just our luck. I hate it when something obstructs our warp-out....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dude, this planet&#39;s a real drag. Wanna destroy it?&quot;</p><p>I had no idea what they were talking about.</p><p>I just vaguely grasped &quot;oh, the Earth&#39;s ending?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Before that, what about this native? Should we return it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. Then we&#39;ll blow up the planet. Oh, but first, try that. C&#39;mon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mean that? The Galactic Big Bang Gacha? Good idea, we might as well celebrate!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright, let&#39;s just push the button with the native&#39;s finger. Not like we&#39;ll roll- SAY WHAT!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You got something!? You got a SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSR rare character!? The odds are even lower than a Big Bang happening!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Damn, this native&#39;s luck is insane... that&#39;s just terrifying, rolling a Universal Genesis tier...</p><p>And it&#39;d be A B S U R D to destroy this planet now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have to guard it carefully. But other intelligent beings won&#39;t let this chance slide. When&#39;s the next Big Bang Gacha going to be held?&quot;</p><p>&quot;56,600,000,000 years from now, apparently. Until then, we have to protect this planet... And we can&#39;t let the other intelligences find out... And we can&#39;t let it evolve in a way that&#39;s self-destructive...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...This adorable native... No, now she&#39;s an angel to us... Should we grant some of our wisdom to this angel?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let us teach her. We&#39;ll let her contact the Root, but stop just short of letting her touch the Galactic Arts. Even if she&#39;ll never understand the theory behind magic and superpowers, she&#39;ll be able to practice them. There we go.&quot;</p><p>They were working on something incredible that didn&#39;t concern me... that&#39;s the feeling I got.</p><p>Their technology sent my consciousness somewhere around Alpha Centauri, and I managed to touch something amazing before I came back.</p><p>When I came to, I was in the Nevada desert again.</p><p>I told Olcott-kun what I experienced , but he just prattled something about &quot;Rolling that on the first ticket is an urban legend lolololol&quot; and when I fired a Mahatma ray at him (it actually worked when I tried it. Wow.) he passed out.</p><p>Then I stripped off his clothes as punishment, and walked 20 km to the next town on my own.</p><p>There were lots of falling stars that night.</p><p>I stifled my beating chest while I increased the speed of my new flying saucer.</p><p>-No matter what, I have to publish my story in a book.</p><p>I was wrapped up in that dream, and a sense of duty, you see.</p><p>\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0</p><p>Helena: &quot;Just kidding!

(Kinoko)</h2><p>Once, we said &quot;What&#39;s wrong with just this one club?&quot; about the ultimate general-purpose blunt weapon Chicken Wing, but that&#39;s ancient history.</p><p>Of course, the longsword is supreme. An all-purpose weapon weapon that can deal with any situation. That it&#39;s plain-looking is but a fly in the ointment.</p><p>If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, just skip this part.</p><hr><p>Now. FGO is finally about to begin its fifth chapter.</p><p>Chapters 1 to 4 have been released as we first produced them, but chapter 5 has benefited from seven months of popularity, and has some additional scenarios.</p><p>Kinoko topped off the stuff the writers submitted, and some extra spice was added after hearing user feedback. That&#39;s what Chapter 5 is.</p><p>If you open the lid, you&#39;ll find twice the jar&#39;s original capacity, and it&#39;s mainly become something like a collaboration... but what&#39;s done is done.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this action-adventure story the two writers worked so hard on, that is the voluminous chatper so far.</p><p>And so, the white-robed angel&#39;s identity is finally clear. Angelic... I guess she&#39;s angelic? Let&#39;s talk about the angelic Nightingale. When one mentions Nightingale, you imagine a white-clad angel, like Mentholatum&#39;s symbolic Little Nurse on their logo, right?</p><p>Me too. Until I researched the esteemed lady&#39;s lifetime!</p><p>I can say this now -- during the development of Fate/EXTRA CCC, Miss Nightingale was a candidate Heroic Spirit for a new enemy Servant all the way up to the end. Going with CCC&#39;s theme, I wanted to make characters almost exclusively female. Smells like a fetish.</p><p>In the end we only got enough budget to add Elizabeth, but I always wanted to show Nightingale&#39;s steel conviction one day.</p><p>And when it was decided that FGO&#39;s fifth chapter would take place in America, it felt like destiny and I was really happy.</p><p>Immediately I decided that she would be the navigator heroine.</p><p>You might protest &quot;but she isn&#39;t white-robed at all!&quot; I assure that you&#39;ll forget all about it once you start Chapter 5.</p><p>&quot;Clothes a priestess wears become priestess&#39; robes. If a priestess can wear it, anything can be priestess&#39; robes.&quot;</p><p>Like a certain shady fox priestess might say, this is a spiritual matter.</p><p>If an angel can wear it, anything can be a white robe! She just happens to be an extremely unhinged angel!</p><p>Anyway, Chapter 5, the Mythic North American War, is jostling with new characters. And, it finally starts tomorrow.</p><p>Pay attention to Helena, Nighting, and ______&#39;s relationship that I don&#39;t really understand.</p><hr><p>That said, let me follow up on the inappropriate remark in the AnimeJapan collab event.</p><p>She said &#39;FGO in its latter half,&#39; but of course that&#39;s only the first portion of the stories. There are seven chapters in all so they have to wrap up, right?</p><p>As for what comes after that, to put it bluntly we&#39;ll continue as long as we can continue, so we&#39;ll manage if we can!</p><p>Like Hollow after Fate, and CCC after EXTRA,</p><p>something definitely awaits you after the first part.</p><p>&#39;What do we do after we beat the last boss?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Didn&#39;t you know?</p><p>The next last boss will come.&#39;</p><hr><p>That said, who&#39;s my personally recommended character this time? I think I&#39;d have to pick that pink-haired woman.</p><p>A naive smile (with lips that can&#39;t hide her ill nature)</p><p>A white fur coat that embodies innocence (nice, Nrvnqsr Chaos)</p><p>And of course her weapon isn&#39;t something as barbarous as a sword, but a more compact rod-like implement (a... whip?)</p><p>This is the Super Bitch that birthed ___. The explosive introduction of Super ___ Bitch ___-chan.</p><p>Did you really think we could leave such a wonderful, perverted character to anyone other than Takayama Masai?</p><hr><h2 id="_2015-6-27-final-episode-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2015-6-27-final-episode-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2015/6/27: Final episode! (Kinoko)</h2><p>&quot;Wow, a new character showed up even though it&#39;s the last episode (monotone).</p><p>I wonder who she is, that beautiful, splendid, blonde drills pro wrestling rich lady!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, she&#39;s in Prilya too. It&#39;s not that surprising.&quot;</p><p>&quot;D A M N Y O U H I R O Y A M A H I R O S H I !&quot;</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Did you enjoy the last episode of Fate/stay night UBW?</p><p>Impressive, ufo managed to cram new settings and character designs into the last episode like it was nothing.</p><p>I think you&#39;ll see why the stage moved for #25 if you watch it.</p><p>To our viewers who have followed us for two seasons, it&#39;s not because &quot;we&#39;re shifting to the Sakura route next,&quot; but because we wanted to give you &quot;the continuation of UBW.&quot;</p><p>I watched it a little ahead of everyone else (SHIROBAKO came out on the morning of the 27th), but I humbly submit that this experiment was quite an achievement.</p><p>This past half year has been a wonderful experience.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;ve returned to my younger self from 10 years ago.</p><p>Again, thank you and fantastic work on the part of Director Miura and all of the staff at ufo!</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>So. While directing my feelings of gratitude to Kouenji,</p><p>I will now give you an inside scoop, per Kinoko custom.</p><p>I began by thinking that #25&#39;s script was &quot;mostly original, so I should write this as a side story to the original [the VN] story.&quot;</p><p>And so I, Kinoko, was at my wits end trying to write something approximating a screenplay.</p><p>That&#39;s right. You know what I mean. In other words, I bit off more than I could chew again. Fuck!</p><p>Thus we drastically cut the parts that weren&#39;t needed for an anime... but the generous people at Aniplex said, &quot;It would be a waste if all of your Nasu-san&#39;s work was cut, so let&#39;s include it as a special in the second box set.&quot;</p><p>Those of you interested in what was cut (Luvia&#39;s turn to shine and Luvia&#39;s turn to shine and Luvia&#39;s turn to shine, etc.) should check out the second box set.</p><p>I&#39;ll take this time to comment on two scenes:</p><ul><li>About Glastonbury</li></ul><p>That&#39;s but one of the many supposed graves of King Arthur dotting England. There are many more.</p><p>Rin: &quot;It&#39;s one of King Arthur&#39;s graves. There are many others so its authenticity isn&#39;t certain, but it at least has a connection to her, right?&quot;</p><p>This line was cut down for the anime.</p><p>That said, Glastonbury was a really beautiful place.</p><p>I can&#39;t quite put into words what I felt when I went through the gate and saw that meadow.</p><p>To put it in game terms, it was the emotion of leaving Kokiri Village for the first time in Ocarina of Time for the N64 + the world of ICO (PS2) in reality.</p><p>If you ever plan on traveling to England, by all means take the time to go there.</p><ul><li>The very final scene</li></ul><p>It&#39;s a scene that you&#39;ll understand if you review it again, but it was easily misunderstood so here&#39;s the excerpt from the script.</p><ul><li>Wasteland scene</li></ul><p>&quot;After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland.</p><p>Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt.</p><p>Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone&#39;s footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking).</p><p>Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope.</p><p>Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait.</p><p>The camera stops at Archer&#39;s trail, and the scene ends on Shirou&#39;s back, shrinking in the distance.</p><p>(To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it&#39;d be best if you didn&#39;t)&quot;</p><p>He&#39;s not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>On that note, the &quot;stay night&quot; aspect of Fate concluded with a splendid final episode.</p><p>But, I&#39;m afraid to say that the Fate anime won&#39;t end yet. We&#39;re almost there, just a bit more, etc etc.</p><p>First, the unprecedentedly out-of-control &quot;Prisma Illya Zwei Herz!&quot; starts on July 24, so you should excitedly wait for that.</p><p>According to reports from the people at Yomiuri Land, it&#39;s rumored Zwei is going to be even more powered up in various, well, you know, that\u200B sort of way!</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Please wait just a bit longer for FGO... almost... almost...</p><p>We&#39;re making the final tweaks...</p><h2 id="_2015-05-23-last-stardust-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2015-05-23-last-stardust-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2015/05/23: Last Stardust (Kinoko)</h2><p>So, did you enjoy episode 20?</p><p>In the Newtype interview, I answered, &quot;they let us detune #20.&quot; This is what I meant by that:</p><p>To take boxing as an example...</p><p>The game version followed a full round to the end with a victory by judgment,</p><p>while the anime version was a play that ended with a burning knockout in the first round, or something.</p><p>---Proceed ahead not by dwelling heavily on the past, but by comparing each other&#39;s states of mind.</p><p>Evolving circumstances are nothing other than the selection of functions.</p><p>In exchange for discarding many components, we investigate a single one thoroughly, and update the maximum speed.</p><p>In the pursuit of making a pleasant visual production, we do away with following the text word-for-word, and lightly run towards our goal.</p><p>That is the UBW anime&#39;s answer.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>So. Enough about all that story writing stuff.</p><p>This time, there\u2019s something even more important to discuss, you know?</p><p>That\u2019s right, why don\u2019t we talk about the extraordinarily powerful background song!</p><p>When Shirou does xxxxx, the background music is by Aimer, who also did the opening theme \u201CBrave Shine.\u201D</p><p>The name of that song is \u201CLAST STARDUST.\u201D</p><p>Actually, both of these songs were submitted by Aimer as candidates for the opening theme of UBW\u2019s second season.</p><p>They\u2019re both great songs that elevate the themes of UBW, so frankly, we were writhing with indecision over which one to use.</p><p>As a result, we strategized that the opening needed a feeling of speed, so we went with \u201CBrave Shine.\u201D</p><p>As a theme song, \u201CLAST STARDUST\u201D was outstanding in my mind.</p><p>\u201CUnfortunately, it breaks our hearts to have to pick only one\u2026 but we\u2019d be happy to see \u201CLAST STARDUST\u201D used in Sakura\u2019s route, so plan for that, please!\u201D</p><p>Is what we insisted to Aimer.</p><p>Three months later, somehow a recording of \u201CLAST STARDUST\u201D that was more polished than the demo version reached my ears.</p><p>Nasu: \u201CHow!? No, I\u2019m incredibly happy though! I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that I can taste UBW just by hearing this! But why did they spend so much time making it!?\u201D</p><p>Director Miura: \u201CAh, about that. I requested it as a background song because I really wanted to attach it to episode 20. But, we didn\u2019t know if it would go well, so we didn\u2019t tell you until it did. Tee-hee.\u201D</p><p>Nasu: \u201CDammit man, you kept quiet about something this important\u2014</p><p>Don\u2019t mind me, just keep doing this\u2014\u2014!\u201D</p><p>And so we got the best possible result.</p><p>Who would\u2019ve thought that it would become a scene brilliant as only an anime could be?</p><p>It was Director Miura\u2019s idea to play \u201CLAST STARDUST\u201D during the farewell scene in the internal world.</p><p>This didn\u2019t come out of the scriptwriting stage.</p><p>Making the story of an anime is like a baton relay.</p><p>The continuity of the script is handed over the the continuity or production, ultimately resulting in many times more good things.</p><p>One such miracle is this episode\u2019s background song, which came out of this process.</p><p>Both \u201CBrave Shine\u201D and \u201CLAST STARDUST\u201D being in the same production distinguished the power that came out of this series of events.</p><p>The full versions of both songs are an even deeper experience, so please buy the single if you like them. They\u2019re really good.</p><p>What? There\u2019s no release date yet?</p><p>You\u2019ll just have to believe in the courage of Sony Music\u2026!</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>And now, please enjoy the five remaining episodes of the TV anime UBW.</p><p>My gratitude to Aimer for their wonderful compositions and songs, and their cooperation that showed a deep appreciation of our work.</p>', 174);
