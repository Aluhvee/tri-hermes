I-I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re mistaken, Master. I&#39;m not Lady Mash.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Does this mean you two are, um, \u201Cinvolved\u201D after all? I don&#39;t suppose you could tell me any more about\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, what am I saying!? This isn&#39;t the time for that! Please wake up, Master! I need your help!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where...are we?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m so sorry! I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know any more than you!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Still, I&#39;m relieved to see you finally up and about.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> As far as I can tell, we&#39;re somewhere outside Chaldea, and it seems you and I are the only ones here.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Did we Rayshift at some point and I simply wasn&#39;t aware?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think I know what&#39;s going on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Looks like it&#39;s happening yet again.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> S-so you know what&#39;s going on here? I&#39;m glad you seem so accustomed to this sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...Aha, I see. So we&#39;re inside a dream you&#39;re having.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> And for some reason as yet unclear to both of us...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...I ended up coming along with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What about before I woke up? Do you remember anything?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you remember anything from before you woke me?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Before you woke up? Let me see...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> The last thing I remember was after dinner last night.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Lord Paracelsus, Lady Circe, Lady Semiramis, and Lord Asclepius were all walking together.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> They were talking about some sort of newly developed ultimate chocolate that they planned to use as their main Valentine&#39;s Day product this year.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> They asked me to bring a sample to your room, so you could try it for yourself.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I was planning to leave shortly after giving you the chocolate...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...but instead, I ended up sharing half of it at your request.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, that solves that mystery.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Seems pretty clear how we got here now!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> What? That is all you needed to figure out what has happened!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I see... So it was the chocolate. You think it must have contained elixirs from all four&#39;s respective places and eras of origin?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> And this is why you&#39;ve been so concerned by the four of them spending time together lately? I see...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Aah, I&#39;m so sorry! I had no idea that chocolate was so dangerous!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s not your fault, Murasaki. You couldn&#39;t have known.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Master... Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I promise I&#39;ll make it up to you after we have resolved our present predicament.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> In the meantime, regardless of how we ended up here, we should try to look for a way to get back home as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> To begin...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Why don&#39;t we head towards that town over there? Maybe we can learn something of value about where we are...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Whoa now, hold it right there, you two. You were just talking about chocolate, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Huh!? Who are you!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Me and my boys here got a real sweet tooth, you see, so it was a stroke of luck running into you two like this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Now why don&#39;t you just hand over the goods and we&#39;ll be on our way, yeah?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> And by goods, I mean chocolate, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, great. This again.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> You mean this sort of thing happens regularly in your dreams, Master!?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Huh? What do you mean, \u201CThis again\u201D? Ain&#39;t never seen either of you before.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Look, save the small talk for the small-timers. We know what we&#39;re doing here. Just give us what we want, and we won&#39;t kill you.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> We heard you talking about chocolate, so just put it down nice and slow and we won&#39;t have any trouble.</p><p><strong>Bandit A:</strong> Hehehe... It&#39;s chocolate time!</p><p><strong>Bandit B:</strong> I can&#39;t remember the last time we &#39;ad fresh chocolate!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Master...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, we don&#39;t have any chocolate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I hate to tell you this, but...we don&#39;t have any...</p><hr><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Huh? You don&#39;t have any chocolate!?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Tch. So you&#39;re just a couple of outsiders then. Could&#39;ve led with that instead of getting our hopes up.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> All right, never mind then. Go on, get out of here.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> And be careful! It&#39;s dangerous around here!</p><p><strong>Bandit A:</strong> Watch out for monsters!</p><p><strong>Bandit B:</strong> Just follow that road there, and it&#39;ll take ye straight ta town!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I-it looks like...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...they&#39;re putting their guns away.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> And that leader of theirs is obviously Lord Teach. Perhaps we could find out more about this place from him?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Hm? What&#39;s up? There something you two need help with?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Wanna ask me for advice? I&#39;m a better listener than I look.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;d be happy to assist. In particular, milady, I couldn&#39;t help but notice your most impressive chest\u2013</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Oops, pardon me. Let me rephrase that.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> I&#39;m speaking, of course, of your dress, and its incredibly intricate embroidery.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> As a man of culture, I find it both intriguing and magnificently easy on the eyes... Huhuhu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, I guess we can talk for a little...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Hwachaaaaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Mwachaaaaaa!?</p><p><strong>Bandits:</strong> Chaaa!? I mean, Chieeef!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hiya! Next, I use my rebound from the flying kick to do a triple midair backflip...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...with a perfect, ten out of ten landing! That. Was. Awesome!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Man oh man, that was a close call for you two, wasn&#39;t it!? Good thing for you I showed up to help!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Wait. IS it a good thing?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Meh, who cares? Wahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Talk about making an entrance...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Is that...? Could it be...?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> H-hey, I don&#39;t know who you are, but were you really paying attention?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> &#39;Cause if you had been, you&#39;d know we were all getting on pretty well.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Hell, my gentlemanly social skills were about to land me a new girlfriend in just a few seconds before you showed up.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Back it up with the moral hazards!</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Bwuh!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hwacha! Whacha! Come on, bring it on!</p><p><strong>Bandits:</strong> Guh-whaaa!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We should probably get them to stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You good to go, Murasaki?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Y-yes, I&#39;m fine!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Master. I promise I&#39;ll put a stop to this squabble!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> This overwhelming abundance of cheerfulness! This rejuvenating party girl power!</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> And above all, these weird movements that are making my head hurt in more ways than one!</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> I can&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve always prided myself on being a gentleman, and so able to endure common attacks...</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> But there&#39;s something about those sparkly attacks that makes me feel like it would be wrong to dodge them... Gurk.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Woohoo, I won! I think I&#39;ll snap a quick pic to remember this by.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um...who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> May I ask who you are?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Heh. Me? I&#39;m nobody important. But, if you insist on calling me something...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> How about...Mysterious Pretty Sailor Girl? No, wait, calling myself \u201Cpretty\u201D is kind extra, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (She&#39;s obviously trying to come up with something on the spot...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t interrupt her, Murasaki.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> There, I&#39;ve got it! I am none other than the shining\u2013</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Sei Shounagon!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> You&#39;re obviously Sei Shounagon, daughter of Kiyohara-no-Motosuke, one of the Nashitsubo, the Five Men of the Pear Chamber! Right!?</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> Uh... Who, me?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I saw you avert your gaze! Don&#39;t think I didn&#39;t!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sei Shounagon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> As in THE Sei Shounagon?</p><hr><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> No, really, I have no idea who you&#39;re talking about. Nope. No clue at all.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Master...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Do you know who Sei Shounagon is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not very well.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Sei Shounagon is an author from Japan&#39;s Heian period, much like myself.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Of course, we had quite different taste in genres. My focus was on narrative, while she preferred essays...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> But, she was still the only other woman besides me who managed to hold her own in the harsh world of the old imperial court...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> A world quite thoroughly dominated by men.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> What&#39;s more, she trounced every single opponent who challenged her to a lyrical Heian MC battle...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...so I know she was very...skilled.</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> Kinda getting the vibe that I&#39;m getting a backhanded compliment.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Of course, Sei Shounagon is best known for \u201CThe Pillow Book\u201D! Have you ever read it, Master!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> It&#39;s said to be the first collection of essays ever written in Japan...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...and it details her singular thoughts and feelings on daily life in the palace court using a wide variety of colorful prose.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> At the time, the first passage from her essay \u201CIn Spring the Dawn\u201D was so shocking that\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, that&#39;s enough for now, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Ah...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I-I&#39;m so sorry. There I go getting carried away again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I take it you&#39;re a huge fan of hers?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> No, I&#39;m not!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I-I-I do think her work has historical value, but that doesn&#39;t mean I care for it!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Not to mention that there are many passages where her attempts to show off her knowledge only demonstrate how little she truly understands!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I can&#39;t tell you how many headaches I got from trying to make sense of all of her anecdotes where she was clearly just bragging about how great her life was!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> In modern parlance, the phrase that best describes my true opinion of her work would be, \u201COh NO she didn&#39;t!\u201D</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> You don&#39;t say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She&#39;s usually much more reserved than this, I promise!</p><hr><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> Wahaha!</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> Hey, I don&#39;t got a problem with it.</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> Hell, I appreciate that kind of candor!</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> I&#39;ll take that over talking about me behind my back any day of the week!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Huh? U-um...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> You mean...you&#39;re not upset?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I thought for sure you were going to say something like, \u201CWhere the hell do you get off talking about me like that, bookworm nerd I&#39;ve never met before?\u201D</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...You ARE Sei Shounagon, right?</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> Well, you know...</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> I may or may not have been called that at one point or another...</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> See, I&#39;m retired now. I decided I wasn&#39;t gonna be Sei Shounagon anymore.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> So I don&#39;t have any plans to write anything new anytime soon! If ever!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...Say what?</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> I&#39;m a new party girl now, full of possibilities! And I&#39;m looking for some new hobby to catch my eye!</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong> So just call me \u201CNagiko\u201D and don&#39;t sweat the rest.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Something tells me it&#39;s not a coincidence that we ran into each other out here like this...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ...so now that we have, we may as well make the most of it!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Wha...?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Wha... Wha...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> What in the world are you talking about!?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Um... Sorry to interrupt your little chat...</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> ...but would you mind hearing me out?</p><h2 id="section-two-wretched-things" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-two-wretched-things" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section Two: Wretched Things</h2><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> A Servant? As in with a capital \u201CS\u201D? What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Uh...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I know my memories are all kind of fuzzy...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> And I have no idea why I&#39;m here in this foreign country I&#39;ve never seen before...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> But it&#39;s not like any of that&#39;s slowing me down, so who cares!? Wahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s certainly, um, free-spirited, isn&#39;t she...?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> It&#39;s not that, Master. She just isn&#39;t thinking. About anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What about your Taizan Commentary Fest?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe your Taizan Commentary Fest could help us out?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I&#39;m afraid not, Master.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I&#39;ve tried to use it numerous times, but it seems like it just doesn&#39;t work in this world.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Maybe the fact that it&#39;s a dreamworld has something to do with it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh well, if you can&#39;t use it, you can&#39;t use it.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I swear, all those times it showed up just when I didn&#39;t want it to, and now that we could use it, it&#39;s nowhere to be seen...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Sigh) I really do need to train more...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Hey, hey!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> So what should I call you two?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> You know a lot about me from when I was still writing as Sei Shounagon. Have we met before or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is Mura\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> My name is Kaoruko!

What&#39;d I ever do to you?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> You mean besides the jump kick to the face!? Just be glad we&#39;re not tying you up and throwing you in the back with the rest of the dangerous animals!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is this place?</p><hr><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> Just a little bar we started hanging out in after the owner ran away and abandoned it.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> I can&#39;t serve alcohol to minors, of course, but otherwise, feel free to make yourselves at home.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Ooh, dibs on the sofa!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Hey Beardie, can I get a nice cold soda over here?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong> For one thing, you&#39;re getting WAY too comfortable.

Ahem. Nice to meet you, you two.

We&#39;re basically the chosen warriors\u2013the last guardians, if you will.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So...you&#39;re not pirates?</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Huh? Pirates? What are you on about? Who&#39;s heard of pirates lubbing it up on land? Nobody, that&#39;s who!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I guess this Lord Teach really is a different person from the Lord Teach at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> So what about you two? What&#39;s your story? Thanks to our scuffle, I can tell you know your way around a fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Huh... So you came here from another world, did you?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> We talking getting spirited away? Isekai&#39;d? Using your modern-day knowledge to give your ordinary ass all sorts of advantages in this new world?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> That sort of thing popular in your world lately or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not just lately. It&#39;s been around since ancient Rome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Only since the time of ancient Rome.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Really? Humanity&#39;s something else, eh? Can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve been fighting culture wars for that long...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Anyway, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m familiar with these kind of stories. It&#39;s just like a summer fling, only with adventure instead of romance, right?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> So, if we take you at your word...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> ...then I guess that means you aren&#39;t working with them.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Hey, Beardie. Beardie. Beardie!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Huh? Weren&#39;t you listening to me? Didn&#39;t you hear me introducing myself?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Who is this \u201Cthem\u201D you last guardians (lol) are fighting?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Do they have anything to do with why you brought us here?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> That&#39;s right. Now that I&#39;ve seen how strong you guys are, I want to ask for your help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tell us more.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> First off, this city&#39;s divided into five districts.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Each district is run by an administrator, and let me tell you, these admins are all real pieces of work.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> They all run around doing whatever the hell they please like they own the place, not just run it.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> The worst part is...they don&#39;t even see us as human.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> If they did, they&#39;d never be capable of such cruelty!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Oh my, that sounds terrible. What did they do, Lord Higekuro?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> (Ahh, Kaorucchi... You&#39;re like an angel come down from the heavens...)</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> They came up with a seriously messed up custom, is what.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> And we can&#39;t get rid of it on our own, which is why we need your help.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Our goal is to rid the world of the most twisted holiday ever...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Valentine&#39;s Day!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Oh, yeah, I know what that is.

Yeah.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> And since it&#39;s all dishonorable to refuse one of these duels, the guys gotta choose to either kill their opponent or love them forev\u2013</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Stop. Just...stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Really reaching for a laugh there.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Besides, we already know what Valentine&#39;s Day is!

No, Valentine&#39;s Day here involves\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u2014, \u2014!!!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Huh... Anyone else hearing that commotion outside?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> It sounds like some sort of argument... What would you like to do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s go check it out.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong> Wait! Valentine&#39;s is still a ways away, right!?</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong> I promise I&#39;ll find some chocolate before the fourteenth! Please, I just need a little more time!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahahaha! Do you really expect us to believe that!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You had a whole year to prepare for this day! If you couldn&#39;t attract anyone by now, you never will!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Exactly, losers!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The only thing guys like you are good for is doing whatever guys like us tell them to!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> What&#39;s with those guys? They&#39;re being real jerkfaces.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Those guys...are the Lonelyheart Police.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The lonely what now?</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> They track down poor saps who don&#39;t get any chocolate and punish them.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> As far as guys like us are concerned, they&#39;re basically grim reapers.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I, um... Oh goodness, I don&#39;t even know what to ask about first, but for the moment...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> What does this punishment involve?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> In this city, it&#39;s a crime to be unpopular and single. If you can&#39;t attract a girl, no chocolate for you.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> And any guy who fails to get himself some chocolate by February 14 is sentenced to being a Lonelyheart:</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> A third-class citizen who has to pay heavy taxes, undertake forced back-breaking labor, and is subject to all kinds of restrictions on their livelihoods!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> And they have to live through that hell for at least a year!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is there no love in this world anymore?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This is awful even for a dystopia.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Oof... That got me right in the feels. I&#39;m so glad you understand. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d swear you and I&#39;ve known each other for years.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Uh, but I digress.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Rumor even has it that every year, some poor saps are taken to the central district, where they&#39;re never seen again.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> That&#39;s just what life is like here in this city... And now, you know the truth about Valentine&#39;s Day.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Well then, I&#39;m gonna go greet them with a dynamic entry: flying kick to the face.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> W-wait!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Just because we now know what&#39;s going on in this city doesn&#39;t mean we should just rush in! It could be dangerous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, we should go. In fact, we have to go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t allow oppression like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Heh. Now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about. I knew you and I were birds of a feather.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> There&#39;s just something about arrogant holier-than-thou types that really makes you wanna throw hands!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> All right, I understand. We certainly can&#39;t stand back and do nothing when we see someone in trouble!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> If this is what you&#39;ve decided, Master, then I&#39;ll be with you every step of the way!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong> Higekuro! You didn&#39;t have to stick your neck out just for me!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;re comrades in arms, right?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> There&#39;s not much time left till Valentine&#39;s Day, so we&#39;ve all gotta stay on the chocolate prowl.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong> Higekuro!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> If there&#39;s a girl you&#39;ve got your eye on, just keep lavishing her with attention until you creep her the hell out. Do that, and you can&#39;t fail!</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong> Yeah... You&#39;re right! Okay, I&#39;ll give it a shot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, you tried to give good advice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think I figured out why these guys don&#39;t have any luck.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Also, what&#39;s a chocolate prowl, anyway?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Phew... Thank goodness we managed to save that poor man.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Though if what you&#39;ve said is true, Lord Higekuro, it would seem that is a common occurrence here.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Yeah, it is... All I want to do is help those poor lonelyhearts out.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> That&#39;s why me and my boys have been going around stealing chocolate from normies with plenty to spare...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> ...and sneaking it over to the lonelyhearts.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> But that&#39;s just putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> We need to take down Valentine&#39;s Day for good, or late-blooming gents like us&#39;ll never have a shot at a happy ending.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> So while I doubt you can turn back at this point, let me ask you again anyway:</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Will you help us?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Master, I don&#39;t have any evidence I can point to in order to support this hypothesis...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> But my intuition is telling me that for this city to have reached this point...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...there must be something here that&#39;s responsible for twisting the world in this way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You mean, like...a Holy Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Yes, I think so.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> So if we can find the Holy Grail&#39;s owner...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...and take the Grail into our own custody...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We should be able to escape from this dreamworld?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...Lord Higekuro.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> We would be glad to help you free this city from the clutches of this Valentine tyranny!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Yeah? I&#39;m thrilled to hear that.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> &#39;Course, I knew that anyone with eyes as clear and pure as you two would have to be good people.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Not to mention you actually bothered to hear what we had to say even when we&#39;d only just met... (Sniff)</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Whoops, sorry &#39;bout that! No tears of joy for me until we&#39;ve won this battle for good.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> All right then, from now on, we&#39;ll all work together to kick those smarmy jerks out of our city!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Heh... Not so fast.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I just came up with a brilliant idea that&#39;ll solve aaall our problems! Wanna hear?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Nope. Not interested.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Why not?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> &#39;Cause whatever it is, I can already tell it&#39;s gonna be anything but brilliant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now, now, let&#39;s give her a chance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It can&#39;t hurt to hear what her idea is.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Heh... Hehe...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Glad to see someone here gets it, Chan-mas. I give you extra affinity points for that\u2606</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Gag!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> All right, Beardie, hear me out.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Stop calling me \u201CBeardie\u201D already!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I&#39;ll admit, this city&#39;s way of celebrating Valentine&#39;s Day is seriously jacked...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ...but what if WE were able to take advantage of that?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I see. And how would we go about this?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> According to this city&#39;s rules, it doesn&#39;t matter who you get chocolate from as long as you get it from someone.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Which means...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ...all we have to do is make a bunch of chocolate and hand it out to all the lonelyhearts ourselves!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> What? You all so blown away by my genius idea that you&#39;re at a loss for words or something?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> That&#39;s right. Once everyone&#39;s got chocolate of their own, they&#39;ll all get to live ultra happily ever after.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> And that&#39;s before you get into the bonus happiness of getting it from a beautiful babe like myself.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> It&#39;s perfect! Completely foolproof! This way, anyone and everyone can be happy!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Anyway, that being said...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> How come you&#39;re all facepalming like there&#39;s no tomorrow?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> I knew you weren&#39;t the sharpest tool in the shed, but I didn&#39;t think you couldn&#39;t even do basic math...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> You calling me stupid or something?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Handing out chocolate of our own is all well and good in theory...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...but where are we supposed to get that much chocolate in the first place?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ...Oh, yeah.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> That is not a helpful answer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is there any way we can get some?</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Frankly, no. Chocolate is an extremely precious resource for guys like us.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> The only ones in this entire city who can get their hands on it are the women who live here.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Ugh, what a waste of time that idea turned out to be! I knew we should never have listened to her! Hmph!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ve never seen you like this before, Kaoruko!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Putting aside how happy it may or may not make everyone, that idea is useless without actual chocolate.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> And seeing how chocolate neither grows on trees nor rains down from the sky, where are we supposed to get that much\u2013</p><p><strong>Underling A:</strong> Boss! Sorry to interrupt you, Boss, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Underling B:</strong> It&#39;s an emergency!</p><p><strong>Underlings:</strong></p><h1 id="we-ve-got-a-golem" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#we-ve-got-a-golem" aria-hidden="true">#</a> We&#39;ve got a golem!!!</h1><p><strong>Underlings:</strong></p><h1 id="yeaaah" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#yeaaah" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Yeaaah!!!</h1><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Keep your voices down, dammit! What&#39;s the big idea!?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> You&#39;ve all seen golems before, right? Just gang up on it and it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p><p><strong>Underling A:</strong> Y-ye don&#39;t understand, Boss... This ain&#39;t a normal golem.</p><p><strong>Underling B:</strong> It&#39;s way bigger, an&#39; stronger, an&#39; it&#39;s got a color I ain&#39;t never seen before.</p><p><strong>Underling B:</strong> So we thought maybe, jus&#39; maybe, it&#39;s the legendary\u2013</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Chocolate...Golem...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Chocolate?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Golem?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Um, I suppose I should ask what sort of creature it is we&#39;re talking about?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> The Chocolate Golem&#39;s a legendary golem that&#39;s said to only appear once every few hundred years. I never thought I&#39;d get the chance to see one for myself...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> True, if we can find a way to defeat it, that oughta give us plenty of chocolate to work with.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> But if the rest of the legend is also true... that would mean it&#39;s a powerful Demonic chocolate!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Dammit! If only we had a way to combat it!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> All right, I see how it is.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Looks like this is my time to shine then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not you, Nagiko.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nope. It&#39;s Kaoruko&#39;s.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I, um... I suppose I&#39;d better get going then...</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s like a literal mountain of chocolate.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Whoooa. I didn&#39;t even know you could have this much chocolate in one place!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Yes, well, with a name like \u201CChocolate Golem\u201D...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...I would honestly have been more shocked if it dropped anything that wasn&#39;t chocolate...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Hot damn, Kaorucchi, I can&#39;t believe how easily you took down a Demonic creature. Thank goodness I&#39;m not Demonic myself.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Then again, seeing how opposites attract and all, maybe we&#39;d end up happily ever after if I WAS Demonic...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;d probably end up as ash, assuming there was anything left at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I doubt it. Kaoruko&#39;s not the type to hold back.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Whoops. I was so overcome by her beauty that I almost forgot myself.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Anyway, now that we&#39;ve got all this chocolate, we should be able to hand it out to every guy in town!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> And when Valentine&#39;s Day comes and goes without any third-class citizens, it oughta bring down the admins&#39; reign once and for all!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Heh... Does that mean we&#39;re doing this?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Yeah, it does.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> We&#39;re going along with your stupid plan after all!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> All right! Now that that&#39;s settled, let&#39;s all pitch in to make enough chocolate for everyone!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> We&#39;re all in on the hijinks now! Yeaaah!</p><p><strong>Underlings:</strong> Aw yeaaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m surprised they&#39;re hitting it off so well...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, um... I don&#39;t really feel comfortable in that sort of atmosphere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does it have something to do with her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you not get along with her?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> In her case...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...I think she was probably meant to be summoned as a Caster.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> But since she was summoned as a class that doesn&#39;t suit her, that might be why she&#39;s so, um, free-spirited.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So she was supposed to be a summer Heroic Spirit (read: party girl)?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> N-not necessarily! That&#39;s only a guess on my part! Nothing certain!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Murasaki?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Master, I...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Before I served Lady Shoushi, the Empress, I used to serve Lady Rinshi.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> It was during that time that I first saw Sei Shounagon back in the palace.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> But she, well...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I don&#39;t think she so much as looked my way.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Not that I can blame her, for I had yet to write anything of note at the time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Her world was so entirely different from mine. She was so strong and seemed to sparkle with energy...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> She was also proud to a fault, immodest, and so spiteful it almost seemed to seep out of her pores...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um... Murasaki?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> This Sei Shounagon doesn&#39;t quite fit the image I always had of her.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I can&#39;t say why that is, though perhaps it&#39;s due to her class. At any rate...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Master.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Writers like Lord Andersen, Lord Shakespeare, and even myself...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> We write because it&#39;s the only way we know how to live.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I especially don&#39;t see how anyone who owes their becoming a Heroic Spirit to their accomplishments as a writer could put down their pen so easily.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> So I can&#39;t help but wonder what could have caused her to\u2013</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Hey hey.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Eeeeeek!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hi, Nagiko.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I thought you were yeah-ing it up over there.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Beardie and his gang said they wanted to bring the chocolate mountain back to their hideout, so I came to get you two.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> What&#39;s up, Kaorucchi? Something on your mind?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> N-no, it&#39;s nothing. Come, Master, let&#39;s go help them.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> You heard the lady, Chan-mas!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you just link arms with me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Wha... What are you doing!? You&#39;re standing much too close to [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her]!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Aww, what&#39;s the matter, Kaorucchi? You jelly?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> All right, don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t leave you hanging.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Why are you linking arms with me now!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> There! Now we can all go back together like the besties we are!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Th-that&#39;s what you meant by \u201Cjelly\u201D!?

Now every single sad sack in town&#39;s got chocolate of their own!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Which means there&#39;ll be zero third-class citizens this year!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> And that, in turn, means there won&#39;t be anyone left who has to suck up to you just to make ends meet anymore!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Hmph, that&#39;s what you think. I don&#39;t know how you got your hands on that stuff...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> ...but if you think that weird chocolate can fool my subjects, you&#39;ve got another thing coming!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> No, seriously. (Nom, nom, nom) This stuff&#39;s way better than it looks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re having even more!?</p><hr><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Wha...!? What&#39;s with this chick? Why is she eating the chocolate instead of handing it over?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Don&#39;t ask me! I don&#39;t know what her deal is, either!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Lady Medb\u2013I mean, Aoi.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> We didn&#39;t come here looking for a fight. Is there any chance we could simply discuss this rationally?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Oh good, so at least one of you&#39;s not a total screwup. What, did you want advice on your love life or something?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Well, too bad. I&#39;m already booked solid for the next six months.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> And even if I did have the time, I wouldn&#39;t waste it talking about anything with losers like you!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> All right, my Lonelyheart Police, it&#39;s time to clean up this city. Go confiscate all of their chocolate.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> The only place for worthless pigs who can&#39;t find love or produce anything of value is at the bottom of my society&#39;s totem pole.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> If you don&#39;t like that idea...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> ...then your only choice is to get down on all fours and beg me for chocolate!</p><p><strong>Slaves:</strong> You rock, Aoi! You rock, Aoi!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yup, that&#39;s definitely Medb.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s obviously Medb, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Yes. I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s also just an illusion given form and a purpose by the Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> A kind of Shadow Servant, most likely.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> All right then.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I don&#39;t really have a reason to go wild right now...but I&#39;m also at that age where people like to go wild even if they don&#39;t have a reason.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> It&#39;s okay if I don&#39;t hold back, right, Chan-mas?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> By all means!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Go for it, Nagiko!</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> You got it!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> All right, you bastards, let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got! &#39;Cause now, you&#39;re going up against...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Higekuro!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Say what!?</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Ugh. This wasn&#39;t supposed to happen...</p><p><strong>Slave A:</strong> I don&#39;t believe it... Lady Aoi lost!?</p><p><strong>Slave B:</strong> Then there&#39;s no one ruling this district anymore! We&#39;re free!</p><p><strong>Slave C:</strong> Three cheers for the lonelyhearts! The lonelyhearts shall inherit the world!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best long-term plan...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Lady Aoi&#39;s Spirit Origin is on the verge of disappearing.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I suppose this means the fabric of her being was too unstable to withstand the damage we inflicted.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> You guys know each other or something? ...No, doesn&#39;t look like that&#39;s the case.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Anyway, I don&#39;t know why you feel bad for her, but don&#39;t bother. This is just what happens when a bad guy kicks it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Yes... I suppose you&#39;re right, but...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Hwachaaaaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Gaaaaaah!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Wh-wh-wh-what do you think you&#39;re doing!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Well, she didn&#39;t look like she was doing so hot, so I thought I&#39;d cheer her up with something sweet.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> ...! ...!!!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> What...did you do? You... You... Idiot!!!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Can&#39;t you tell that calorie control is crucial to keeping this bod so perfectly proportioned!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> U-um, excuse me, but...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I think your Spirit Origin has stabilized...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, I&#39;ll be damned.</p><hr><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Grr...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Besides, you and I are enemies, right?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> What were you even trying to do by saving me?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> And please say it&#39;s not &#39;cause you&#39;d have trouble sleeping if you let me die, or something cheesy like that.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Uh, no.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I just remember Kaorucchi said she wanted to ask you something, so I thought it&#39;d be better if you stuck around.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> THAT&#39;S the only reason you saved me!? Seriously!?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Couldn&#39;t you come up with anything better than that!? Anything at all!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I mean, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got, so...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Well... I guess if I had to choose something else...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> It&#39;s your hair, Aocchi.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u201CAocchi\u201D? Huh? You don&#39;t mean me, do you?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> A-and what about my hair?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I&#39;ve been wondering how you got it so silky smooth ever since you showed up.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> What kinda product do you use?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Are you kidding me? You want me to tell you my hair care regimen?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> And how you keep your skin so smooth, and how you do your nails hidden inside those gloves...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> There&#39;s so much about your beauty routine I&#39;m dying to know about!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Q-quit staring at me, will you?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Th-those are trade secrets, all right? Why would I tell you about them? We&#39;re not even friends.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Aww, come on.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Okay then, let&#39;s say that chocolate I gave you was friendship chocolate and that we&#39;re friends now. Sound good, pal?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Hey, don&#39;t look at me. I can&#39;t help you out of this.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Let me get this straight. This girl I was fighting to the death just a few minutes ago is now saying she wants to be friends because she loves my hair, right?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Is this normal now? Am I the weirdo for not getting it?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Well, look.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> You can&#39;t go back to the way things were here anymore anyway, so you might as well enjoy yourself, right?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Yeah... Good point. This all seems real silly when you stop to think about it.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Besides, there&#39;s no point to me running this district without any third-class citizens to subjugate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aocchi...</p><hr><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Don&#39;t call me that.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> So, uh... You there, with the beard. Take me somewhere I can blow off some steam.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> We can have tea or something while I manicure the hell out of this nutjob&#39;s nails.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Really!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> You really really mean it, for real!? Yeaaah! Come on, guys, let&#39;s get out of here!</p><p><strong>Underlings:</strong> Aw yeaaah!!!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> ...I almost feel bad for you guys.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> You must have your hands full with her, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Oh my! I didn&#39;t know Medb\u2013Er, Aoi was even capable of looking at anyone with such overwhelming pity!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> And you know, while we&#39;re at it...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> I honestly thought this city&#39;s rules were kind of messed up, too.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> I mean, where&#39;s the fun in breaking a hot guy&#39;s body and spirit when all it takes is a piece of chocolate to make him do whatever you say?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Lady Aoi...?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> So if you guys reaaally want my help... I guess I could think about offering it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I... Yes! Absolutely! That would be wonderful!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You sure this is a good idea?</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Didn&#39;t I already tell you not to ask me!?</p><h2 id="section-four-thankful-things" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-four-thankful-things" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section Four: Thankful Things</h2><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Heehee. Teeheehee.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Please stop that, Shounagon\u2013</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I mean, N-Nagiko. It&#39;s starting to creep me out.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Check it, Kaorucchi! My nails are sooo shiny!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I know because you showed them to me yesterday! And please call me by my proper name already!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Just to be clear, you need to take care of your nails every day if you want them to stay in good shape. You can&#39;t go slacking off just because it&#39;s a hassle.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I got it. Thanks a bunch, Aocchi!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Would you stop calling me that!? We only just met, you know!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> When did this turn into a slumber party?</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Well, as long as she doesn&#39;t turn on us, I don&#39;t have a problem with it. That&#39;s not to say all of our bad blood&#39;s water under the bridge now...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> ...but personally, I&#39;m always ready to welcome another girl to the team.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Hey, you with the beard. Stop ogling me this instant.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Just because I&#39;ve got time on my hands now doesn&#39;t mean you get to take my helping you out for granted.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Really, you should be bowing and scraping and throwing yourself on the ground to thank me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You rock, Aoi!</p><hr><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Exactly. That&#39;s more like it.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> ...Do I know you from somewhere?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> You know, you do make a good point, Aocchi.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> We wouldn&#39;t have known much about this district&#39;s admin if you hadn&#39;t told us.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> You said most of this district is made up of a black market run by the admin herself, yes?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> So if their primary product is chocolate, does that mean their main customer base is\u2013</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Yup. Lonelyhearts who&#39;ll pay whatever it takes to avoid getting demoted to third-class citizen status.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> I can see you&#39;re wondering what could possibly be so fulfilling about chocolate like that, Kaorucchi.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> True, there might not be much to gain from the chocolate itself, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s meaningless.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Suffice to say, there are some gents out there for who that fact alone has to be enough to get by.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Hmm, I gotcha. Well, don&#39;t you worry about a thing, Beardie.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I&#39;ll make sure to save every single purehearted guy here with my special handmade chocolate!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Uh, first off, you didn&#39;t make it; Kaorucchi did. Second, there were way more guys who wanted to get chocolate from her than you.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Wahahaha hwacha.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Yeow!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Well, before we start handing out chocolate, we&#39;ll need to do something about this district&#39;s admin.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> After all, she wouldn&#39;t be selling her chocolate for such exorbitant prices if she wasn&#39;t also spending lots of money to buy out the supply.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> So if we don&#39;t disrupt her hold on the market before handing the chocolate out, it&#39;ll all just end up being sold back to her.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Damn, Aocchi, I didn&#39;t know you were so smart! We didn&#39;t even think of that!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Speak for yourself. I already knew that was going to be a problem.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Say, what was this admin called again?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Whenever I meet someone who&#39;s not worth my time, I forget their name instantly.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Higekuro, and Aoi...)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (...I&#39;m probably just overthinking it...)</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Oh hey, this looks like a different part of town. We must be at the black market by now.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Make sure you all watch out for pushy salespeople.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> If one thinks you&#39;re a sucker, they won&#39;t ever leave you alone\u2013not for a second!</p><p><strong>Street Merchant A:</strong> You there, the man with the lovely beard!

Seriously, my poor glass heart can&#39;t take jokes like that.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> No, really, Beardie, are you sure you&#39;re not popular with the ladies?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> &#39;Cause it seems to me like you&#39;re just pretending to be a hopeless old man.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> La la la, I can&#39;t heaaar yooou! You can&#39;t put one over on me, wily high school girl!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Aw crap, it&#39;s the Lonelyheart Police.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Then, does that mean\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Teehee, it&#39;s quite all right, I promise. They all work for me at my shop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That voice...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh my, you&#39;re a much more austere older gentleman than you seemed from a distance, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Might you be here looking for chocolate, by any chance?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Then you&#39;ll definitely want to stop by my shop. Our chocolate is the genuine article, unlike some other stores here I could name.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And needless to say, it&#39;ll pass the Lonelyheart Police&#39;s inspection just like that!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> So, what do you say? Care to sample one?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Every Oboro brand chocolate is guaranteed to melt both your heart and your body, you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s Moolah!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Oboro...?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Oh, yeah, that sounds right.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Oh? What&#39;s this now?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Let&#39;s see... You run the neighboring district, right? Now what was your name again...?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Hehe, sorry, I forgot. When I meet someone who&#39;s not worth my time, I always forget their name instantly.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> The hell!? How rude can you get!?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you made it this far treating other people like garbage!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Pot, meet kettle.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> My, my, it&#39;s not every day we see an admin here doing her own shopping.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> What happened? Did you get carried away and hand out so much chocolate you don&#39;t have enough to go around anymore?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Well, don&#39;t worry. You&#39;re not the first woman to ruin herself by giving too much away to men.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Yeah, okay.

Did she cross a line?</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> It&#39;s more like, her acting so chummy kind of makes me suspicious...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> I mean, you&#39;ve heard of those phone scams where people pretend to be your relatives to ask you for money, right? Don&#39;t you think they&#39;re terrifying?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Is that what&#39;s going on here? Are you after my money?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Nope, no going-after-money-ing here.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Those ears of yours just reminded me of an old colleague of mine, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Oh... That&#39;s a new one.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> So you once knew someone else with ears like mine? Is that it?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Yup! ...In fact, they looked exactly like the picture you&#39;ve got on those chocolates there.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> That is a cat.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Yeah, a cat.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Wait. Just a moment. Are you saying your old colleague is a cat!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Oh man, this Myoubu chocolate looks reaaal good. How much do these go for?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Wha\u2013That has nothing to do with what we were just talking about! Seriously, what is her problem!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s just...like that. You get used to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> W-well... All right.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> I very much doubt you can afford it, but just for your reference...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> ...this kitty-cat chocolate typically costs as much as an average citizen makes in a year.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> A year!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Um... Hang on. Since Valentine&#39;s Day happens every year...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> That&#39;s right. If you work hard for the whole year, you&#39;ll be able to afford one next year, too.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Well, what do you know. That&#39;s actually pretty considerate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So that&#39;s what an actual demon looks like...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So that&#39;s what actual demons look like...</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Of course, we have very reasonable payment plan options as well. How about it, Bearded Sir?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> You seem like you have no family to support, so you can spend your money as you like.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Really, it&#39;s not expensive at all if you consider it money spent on a hobby. Just sign this purchase form here, and you&#39;ll be on your way!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> No... I&#39;ve heard enough.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> I see now that you&#39;re the cold, heartless personification of Valentine&#39;s Day itself.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> H-huh!?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> People like you have been oppressing and exploiting me for my whole life...and I&#39;ve never had so much as a single date to show for it!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Well, no more! I&#39;ve had it up to here with that depressing reality!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Now get ready to feel the pain of every single sad sack you Valentine bastards have ever messed with!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> So what you&#39;re saying is, there are good Valentines and bad Valentines...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> ...and Oboro&#39;s here is the bad kind, right? Then I&#39;m waaay down to help you destroy it. Also her. Mostly her.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Huh? W-we&#39;re going to fight now!? I was hoping to avoid combat if we could, but I suppose that&#39;s no longer an option.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> After all, if we don&#39;t do something about her now, we&#39;ll never be able to hand out our own chocolate!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> H-h-h-hand out!? As in, for free!? That&#39;s the most horrible thing I&#39;ve ever heard!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Employeeeeees!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Get rid of these malicious customers before they ruin my business model!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Awawawah! My shop! My shop is on fireee!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Nooo! My poor, precious money!!!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Damn, I never expected our Noble Phantasms to hit the shop directly.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Um... I think we may have gone a little too far...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Oopsies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s so darn cute!</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Never mind that!!!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> What am I supposed to do now that I&#39;m flat broke!?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> You really are a dummy, aren&#39;t you? This is what you get for caring so much about money of all things.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> All you had to do was bring a man or three under your heel, and they would&#39;ve gotten money for you.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> That doesn&#39;t strike me as a very, um, nice way to live, either...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Heh. Don&#39;t feel too bad, Obocchi. You still have your... Um...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> You still have those soft, fluffy ears going for you!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> As long as you&#39;ve got fur like that, you can always start your life over, no problem.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Probably.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> How is that possibly supposed to cheer me up!? You just made me sound like some kind of hairy animal!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I mean, it is what it is, you know?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Besides, losing everything you&#39;ve got means there&#39;s nothing to do but try something new, right?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> It&#39;s a lot more fun than you might think.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> You can trust me on that.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Huh? Something...new?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Yeah!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> We&#39;ve got an old bar just laying around. We could rebuild it into a caf\xE9!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> A caf\xE9 where the staff wears fluffy ears. What do you think? I bet it&#39;d be a hit.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> That&#39;s OUR old bar you&#39;re talking about! You can&#39;t turn it into a caf\xE9!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> It&#39;s our holy land! Our safe space! A world of men, by men, and for men!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> A fluffy ear caf\xE9... I think I really like the sound of that...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Now look what you did! You woke the beast in a very literal sense just to get her hopes up for nothing!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Um, Nagiko, maybe you should be a little more considerate towards Lord Higekuro...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Aw, c&#39;mon. Why would he have a problem with a caf\xE9 full of pretty girls wearing fluffy ears?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Okay, so this is not about me having any interest in beast girls. Not one damn bit. Uh-uh. No, sir...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> But if you want to use that old bar to make a caf\xE9 that just HAPPENS to be packed to the rafters with them at all hours...I, uh, guess I can&#39;t stop you.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Wha...?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Hehe, hehehe... You&#39;ve got yourself a deal, Bearded Sir.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Yeah, I feel good about this!

Don&#39;t you remember our promise to never keep secrets from each other!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I made no such promise.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Oh, THAT got your attention, huh!?</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong> You there.

They&#39;re finally gonna round us up and ship us all off to the sanatorium!</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong> Dammit. We were too late...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> A sanatorium? Does that mean you won&#39;t just be demoted to third-class citizens?</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong> O-o-oh man, that sure is a lot of police headed this way!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> It looks like someone&#39;s riding the palanquin up in front. Is that this district&#39;s admin?</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong> Indeed. That is none other than the monstrous, unnamable admin who runs this district.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong> We usually call her...</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong> ...the Gent Killer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> As in, someone who goes around killing gentlemen?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> There you are. So this is where you&#39;ve all been hiding.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Please, just do what you&#39;re told.

No way are we letting you take us!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s okay.

Don&#39;t you mean hotcakes?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> No, she means griddle cakes.</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong> Wait. I thought they were called flapjacks.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I&#39;m sorry to interrupt, everyone, but I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s important right now!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Especially not when we have more immediate concerns!</p><p><strong>Murasaki:</strong> Um, I&#39;m sorry.

I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s going on later. Right now, you all need to get ready to fight. Like, now.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Oh? What&#39;s going on? Somebody having a fight!?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Yeah, you could say that...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> It looks like the final boss came looking for us of her own accord.</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong> Ah...

Nice to see the enemy leader come to meet us of her own accord.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> A lot of good lonelyhearts have suffered at your hands...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Now, I\u2013WE, are gonna avenge them tenfold!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ah, yes, it&#39;s you. The ones who have been the cause of so many disturbances in my city.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Unfortunately for you, I cannot allow any further disruptions to our Valentine&#39;s Day plans.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> No... It can&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> You&#39;re...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I, Fujitsubo, will see that every one of you insolent villains meets the untimely ends you deserve!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Craaap! The leader of the Genji!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe we should just run for it!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> N-no, it&#39;s all right. Both of you, please get ahold of yourselves!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> That is not the real Lady Raikou, but an imposter made by the Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> After all, the real Lady Raikou would never do anything so cruel!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> O-oh, yeah, good point!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I don&#39;t really get it, but, got it!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Right then, Beardie, no need to hold back!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> You know it!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Hey, General Fujitsubo, or whatever you said your name was!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Where&#39;re you taking those guys you just rounded up like they were stray dogs or something?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Why&#39;re you persecuting us like this!?</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> Pitiful lonelyheart... Single though you may be, you are still human.</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> Even you must have received chocolate from one person on Valentine&#39;s Day:</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> Your mother.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Why&#39;d you go and say that!? I only just put that trauma behind me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s rough. Really rough...</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong> Huh? Is it that bad to get chocolate from your mother?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Bad? It&#39;s horrible! Picture this: a young man sets off to school full of hope for the day ahead, only to have that hope dashed when nobody gives him a single Valentine chocolate.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Dejected and forlorn, he makes his way back home... only to find pity chocolate from his mother!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> All at once, he&#39;s flooded with joy and despair in equal measure!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Trust me, there&#39;s no experience more cruel or bittersweet for a sensitive young man coming of age!</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong> Yeah, I can kind of understand that...</p><p><strong>Murasaki:</strong> Not me.

I was still a tender young lad back then, all right!?</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> Exactly. That is how a son receiving Valentine&#39;s chocolate from his mother should react.</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> However...</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> Can you, in turn, picture how painful it must be for a mother giving her son chocolate out of love...</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> ...only to have it spurned because it \u201Cdoesn&#39;t count\u201D?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Oh shit!</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> I gave a great deal of thought as to how best to get sons to appreciate how wonderful chocolate from their mother truly is...</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> ...and one day, I finally arrived at an answer.</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> When people have hit rock bottom is when they begin to appreciate the joys they once took for granted!</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> I knew that once these men had fallen to the bottom rung of society and were utterly starved for chocolate, they would see chocolate from their mother as the ultimate expression of love!</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> From there, my many sons and I would all live together, happily ever after...</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> That...is my Make All Men into My Sons Plan!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I, uh... I see. Well that&#39;s...um... That&#39;s the leader of the Genji for you. Yeah...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Nooobody else could&#39;ve come up with a next-level plan like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No Genji here! Only Fujitsubo!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> And not the real one at that!</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> If you mean to interfere with my plan, then I will show you no mercy.</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> Not even against my fellow administrators.</p><p><strong>All Four:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> That being said...</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> I know that none of you live here in this city.

What is it, Chan-mas!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I&#39;m kind of in a hurry right now, so make it two words or less, okay!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good luck.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Thanks, Chan-mas!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> All right, you lot, this is it!

This is sad enough for me as it is!</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> But even though you&#39;ve managed to defeat me, there will be another mother ready to take my place...</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> If you wish to avoid that fate, then make sure you don&#39;t forget your White Day return gift...</p><p><strong>Fujitsubo:</strong> Urk.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> We did it... We really did it!

Now we can just go back to buying and selling chocolate like normal.</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong> Well, I guess the fact that it&#39;s been so, uh, out there should make it easy to go back to normal...</p><p><strong>Murasaki:</strong> I think it&#39;s a perfectly lovely event, myself.</p><p><strong>Murasaki:</strong> Why do you want to cancel it forever, mister?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> Gaaah! Those piercing, innocent eyes! My poor heart can&#39;t take it!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong> I, um... I&#39;m sorry.

Murasaki...!</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> They&#39;re all responsible for taking Lady Teishi away from you, right!?</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> So what are you waiting for!?</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> You\u2013I...have every right to curse them to hell and back!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Yeah, maybe you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Nagiko!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Hey, Kaorucchi?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Y-yes? What is it?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Sei Shounagon&#39;s role was done when she finished writing \u201CThe Pillow Book\u201D.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I didn&#39;t have any other stories I wanted to tell, and I didn&#39;t feel like coming up with one, either.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I hoped Lady Teishi&#39;s soul would get to rest in peace, but whether it did or not, it was out of my hands.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> So I thought, if I sacrificed \u201CThe Pillow Book\u201D and the name Sei Shounagon...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ...maybe that would be enough to help her, even just a little.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> So that&#39;s what I did.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> So...you gave up everything you had as Sei Shounagon...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...to soothe Empress Teishi&#39;s soul?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Once I did, that was it.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Who I am now is more like the dregs of tea at the bottom of an empty cup.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I&#39;m no longer sad, or resentful, or anything like that.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I still love Lady Teishi, and that will never change...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ...but aside from that, I&#39;m just fake old Nagiko.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> No... You&#39;re wrong! You&#39;re not fake at all!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Believe me, I would have been much more at ease if you had been!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Master...?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The friendship chocolate you gave us...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...and the bonds it helped us form...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...are truly real.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ...Tahaha.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> So that was your game there, huh, Chan-mas? Well, you got me. You got me right in the feels.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> So the opportunity I got from being fake was Valentine chocolate, huh?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I guess friendship chocolate, chocolate from your mom, and chocolate given out of obligation might not be the same as chocolate from your true love...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ...but maybe it&#39;s also okay for them to convey feelings that are just as genuine as true love.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Maybe, even though I&#39;m fake... my feelings can still be real.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Hmm. You know...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> That was pretty sentimental of me just now, wasn&#39;t it, Chan-mas?</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> Are you done?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Rokujou!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Are you still\u2013</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> How touching.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> I think I threw up a little bit, so thanks for that, but...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> Did you really think that was going to change my mind?</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> That I&#39;d be so convinced I was wrong I&#39;d just hand over my Holy Grail like it was no big deal?</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> Well, if so, you were wrong. That&#39;s not happening.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> This resentment and anger are all I&#39;ve got. This grudge is who I am.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> If all of it went away, I&#39;d probably disappear with it.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> So there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to let that happen.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> If I can&#39;t at least curse you to death, Murasaki Shikibu...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> ...then there&#39;s no point in my even being here!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Oh no!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Rokujou&#39;s feelings are resonating with the Holy Grail fragment! This is terrible!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> She&#39;s trying to destroy the entire dreamworld, and us along with it!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Well, I can understand how she feels. She is me, after all.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> And believe me, I used to have plenty of anger myself.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> If I&#39;d held onto them... I could&#39;ve easily ended up like her.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> But, I&#39;m not gonna do that now.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Right now, I&#39;m more pumped up than I&#39;ve ever been before.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> And since you two are here to watch...I think I&#39;m gonna show you just a bit of how badass I can really be!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Is this...Kyoto...?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> It can&#39;t be... Is this... Did you create a Reality Marble!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> What ultimately thawed my sad, frozen heart, were my memories of more brilliant, colorful days...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, young people! Just be happy!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> What you smiled about yesterday will ease your sadness and lead you onward to days yet to come!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Paint over all of them, Pillow Book!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Emotional Engine\u2013Full Drive!!!</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> That&#39;s how I made it through the days.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> I made a beautiful field of flowers in my mind, and I&#39;d retreat to it whenever life became unbearable.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> I really am a pitiful, hopeless fool.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> But for me...the version of me consumed by resentment...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> ...this scenery and feelings...are pure poison.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Rokujou...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> So come on, other Sei Shounagon. Let&#39;s finish this properly.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> I refuse to become a complete fool like you, so I&#39;m going to end this here and now.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> I&#39;ll curse you all to death...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> And when I&#39;m satisfied that I&#39;ve had my revenge...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> ...I&#39;ll disappear along with you.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Fine by me! Just don&#39;t expect me to pull my flying kicks!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Come on, you two, don&#39;t just stand there!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> This is really, truly the final battle!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> R-right! Understood!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come on, you two! Let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> Does this mean I lost?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Yeah...I think it does.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> I see... You know, easy as it might&#39;ve been, nursing a grudge forever was a lot more boring than I thought.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong> Would you believe it?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> The Holy Grail fragment... Ah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did they just stick themselves back together!?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Does this mean that...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...the Holy Grail is back to normal now?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I thought I left it behind, but I guess it came back to me.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Oh well... Wouldn&#39;t be the first time that happened, right?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Okay, Chan-mas, here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Just like that!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> You both wanted this, right? So you can have it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> But, if we take this back with us, then...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nagiko...</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Aah! What&#39;s going on!? It&#39;s freaking me out!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Oh, wait, never mind. This just means I&#39;m getting sent to the Throne...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ...and that everything that happened here is gonna be inscribed in my record...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Hmm... Well, that&#39;s kind of a shame. I was having so much fun.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...Please, make sure you remember at least that much.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> After all, it wouldn&#39;t be fair if we were the only ones to remember, would it?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Bahahaha! That&#39;s a hell of a tall order there, Kaorucchi!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> But okay. I&#39;ll do my best to somehow make myself hold onto it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m surprised that&#39;s even an option...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Nagiko... No, Sei Shounagon...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> There&#39;s one thing I always wanted to ask you if I ever got the chance.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Did you... D-did you, um...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> E-ever happen to read\u2013</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> \u201CThe Tale of Genji\u201D? Yup. The whole thing.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> As for my impressions... It shined so damn bright it almost bummed me out.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> It grabbed my heart and wouldn&#39;t let go, but it always had a warm and familiar feeling to it, too...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> In fact, that might&#39;ve been the first time I stayed up all night to finish a book because I couldn&#39;t put it down.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I mean, I could never write anything like that no matter how hard I tried.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> So getting to spend all this time with its author, well...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> It made me really, really happy.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Ah...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I-I also, um...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Oh, wait, hang on.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> I really hated Hikaru, though.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Would you just go already!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Wahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> And of course, I can&#39;t forget you, Chan-mas! Thanks for everything!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No problem.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> See you again someday.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> ... ...Hehe.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Don&#39;t you remember? I already promised I&#39;d come to see you again.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> All right, you two, take care!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> And don&#39;t forget to say hi to all the others for me!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong> Bye-byyye!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Sei Shounagon... A smug and conceited woman who considers herself the gods&#39; gift to the world...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Even now that I&#39;ve met her, I&#39;m still at a loss as to how to describe her.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> She certainly was...a lot, wasn&#39;t she?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That she was. She was a lot of fun to be around, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, but I still had fun hanging out with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Yes, I...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I enjoyed myself, too.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Oh.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Now that we&#39;ve collected the Holy Grail, it looks like my mind is losing its connection to this world.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I would have liked to have said goodbye to everyone else before leaving, but I suppose I won&#39;t get the chance now...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Master...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Now that this dreamworld has lost the Holy Grail that made it...is it going to simply disappear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just because we may not have the same dream again...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll disappear once we wake up.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> At least, I&#39;d like to think so.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Hehe... Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I&#39;d like to think so, too...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> All right, we should probably be on our way.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> And once we get back, it&#39;s sure to be Valentine&#39;s Day at Chaldea, too!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Afterwards, we woke up in Chaldea without so much as a scratch.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Apparently, we were asleep for a whole week, but the others quickly accepted it as \u201Cmore of the usual dream nonsense.\u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It made me realize once again how much they&#39;ve all been around the block, as they say nowadays.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And now, today is Valentine&#39;s Day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Women and men alike went in to visit Master while [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] was still in bed, and it wasn&#39;t long at all before [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] had a veritable mountain of chocolate piled up in [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] room.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I suppose it just goes to show that what goes around, comes around.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Oh yes, as for the jointly developed chocolate that was in the works, I&#39;m happy to report that the plans have since been scrapped.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Its creators were all disappointed, but I can&#39;t feel too bad for them. Something that dangerous should never have made it to market in the first place.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As for me...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> It should be right around... Ah.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> There it is. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I haven&#39;t read it in a very long time... but I think I can make a special exception today.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> In spring, it is the dawn that is most beautiful. As the light creeps over the hills...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And there you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So yeah, that was another thing that happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. Congratulations on another job well done, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Still, I have to say...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It feels like it&#39;s become a sort of Valentine&#39;s Day tradition for something to go wrong, hasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m only sorry I wasn&#39;t able to help you out with this one. Anyway, this latest world revolved entirely around chocolate, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, knowing you, Senpai, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be able to get along just fine in a world like that, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, I don&#39;t know about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I mean, I guess so...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can see that you&#39;ve already gotten lots and lots of chocolate from everyone else again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is it too late for me to give you some as well?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Or, maybe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...you&#39;re so sick of chocolate by now you don&#39;t even want to look at any more?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Coming from you, Mash...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d be more than happy to accept!</p><hr><p></p>', 2260);
