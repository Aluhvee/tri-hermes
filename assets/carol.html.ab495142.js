Christmas is just around the corner, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And I&#39;ve seen enough in the database to have a pretty good idea of just how crazy Christmas at Chaldea gets.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Captain also certainly seems to have a lot on his plate...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You two. What are you looking so giddy about?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Can&#39;t you see that everyone&#39;s busy getting ready to deal with the Lostbelts?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Get back to your standby positions at once. This is no time to be sitting around twiddling our thumbs.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way, Director Goredolf, may I ask you where you got that cake?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about sitting around with a literal piece of cake?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! Fou is taking strong issue with that proposed course of action!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hm? You&#39;ve got it all wrong, you little bacon thief. My snack here is all part of my emergency preparation regimen.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Thanks to all these bizarre little events that have been taking place on top of the already strenuous Lostbelts, my stress levels are at an all-time high.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> And considering the toll they were found to be taking on me during my last physical before this nonsense, I don&#39;t even want to think about what my next one will be like if this keeps up.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Which is why my technical advisor officially prescribed me a strict sweets quota to aid my mental health.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> If you don&#39;t believe me, go ahead and ask Da Vinci yourself.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Suffice to say, this cake is mine alone. And before you ask, I&#39;ll have you know there was not a single (overt) bribe involved.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou. Fooou? (Sniffing for anything \u201Cunder the table.\u201D)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay... But, um, I have to ask, Director Goredolf: Are you sure you&#39;re okay eating that cake?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, considering that there was that, well...poisoned cake incident...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Oh, yes, that. Naturally, I&#39;m still dealing with some PTSD from that unfortunate incident.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Fortunately, I oversaw every step of making this cake personally, so I have complete confidence in its safety.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Ahahahaha. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever baked with such an...attentive audience before.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> But I&#39;m still happy to do it. Especially if it can help you overcome your cake PTSD.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...(Munch)...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Ordinarily, it would be a tremendous waste of magical energy... (Munch)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...to employ a Servant, who is basically like a familiar, for anything besides combat...(Nom nom)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But considering how few hands we have to spare, as well as the need to let our staff get the rest they deserve...(Gulp)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...I&#39;m afraid I simply had no choice but to have you attend to more menial matters.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Really, it&#39;s okay. Like I said, I&#39;m happy to do it.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Although, speaking of things one&#39;s happy to do... There&#39;s something I wanted to ask you about, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Stare at cake)</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...Did I not just get done telling you this cake is mine!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No fair!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> All&#39;s fair in food and war!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Besides, you don&#39;t look like you&#39;ve ever been stressed out a day in your life!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Now, now, don&#39;t worry about that. I&#39;ll bring you some cake of your own later.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> What I wanted to say was, it&#39;s getting to be that time of year, isn&#39;t it? What was it again...? Oh, right! Christmas!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, it is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s been wonderful seeing all the Servants in such high spirits.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Is that what you call it? It all seems like a bunch of idle frivolity to me. Hmph, some heroes this lot turned out to be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s a little hard to take you seriouslywhile you&#39;re holding that cake, Director.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Everyone knows a commander&#39;s penchant for tea or coffee has nothing to do with their ability to lead. Why should cake be any different?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Nom nom) All that aside, Director</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Boudica, my apologies for interrupting, but would you mind not being so quick to dole out excess calories to our resident Master!?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Oh, sorry. [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She] just looked like [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] wanted it so badly. I couldn&#39;t help myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Anyway, I think it&#39;s great that everyone&#39;s excited about the holidays, but there is something I found odd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Odd, you say?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> We don&#39;t have a Santa.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And by Santa, I assume you mean one of the numerous Santa Servants we&#39;ve had over the years?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (Numerous Santas? Oh dammit. My mustache just lost all its luster.)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (That&#39;s a sign of A-rank danger if ever I saw one. I&#39;d best live up to that Phoenix nickname and fly the coop while I can.)</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Usually, by this point, we&#39;d have a new Santa saving up magical energy for presents...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> ...or the Santa from last year would already be on the lookout for a new one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s true...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come to think of it, I haven&#39;t seen the kid Servants anywhere either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Now that you mention it, I don&#39;t think I&#39;veseen Nursery Rhyme or her friends either.</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong> Hey guys! Oh? I don&#39;t see Gordy anywhere... Guess he made a break for it, huh?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong> Oh well, never mind him. Would you guys mind coming to the Command Room? Like, right now?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ve got a minute Singularity on our hands that needs to be taken care of posthaste.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Right on schedule, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong> You know it!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> So we&#39;ve got an emergency?

It seems resolving this peacefully may be more difficult than I thought.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Master, would it be all right with you if I neutralize them first?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And by neutralize, you mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Fight them.</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Bring it!</p><p><strong>Guardians:</strong> You&#39;re on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why&#39;re they all ganging up on us!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> This is all part and parcel of administering vaccines. First, we start by properly disinfecting the patient!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I never knew Santa had so many enemies!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> How many times must I say it? I&#39;m an ordinary nurse, not Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think we have very different definitions of \u201Cordinary,\u201D but never mind that now! Prepare for battle, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Hey, so, now that that&#39;s all over with...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...do you think you could chalk this up to a bad dream and just forget it ever happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know. It was pretty unforgettable...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Well do your best! I&#39;m begging you here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Forget what ever happened?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Exactly! Thanks for understanding, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Phew. Thanks for snapping us out of that.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> Why in the world was I set on becoming Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> You were sick. Confused. Not in your right minds.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> You were all suffering from...let&#39;s call it \u201CSanta Claus Syndrome\u201D for the time being.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, but how did that happen?</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m pretty sure I was cooking before this all went down, but that&#39;s all I know.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Me too. Though I also get the feeling that someone told me I was going to become Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> Same.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> Oh, I just remembered something else. I also heard a jingling sound, just like the one coming from those.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You mean these bells?</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That&#39;s right. I remember someone said something like:</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> \u201CYou can be Santa too!\u201D</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Once the bells started ringing, I gradually lost consciousness...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...and the next thing I knew, I was Santa. Well, trying to become Santa, anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That sounds like something out of a horror movie.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Indeed, what a horrifying scenario. I didn&#39;t know Santa was contagious...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Just to be sure, you didn&#39;t do this, right, Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I did not.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> That said...I also don&#39;t remember when or how I acquired this new outfit.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I think I may have been talking to someone right beforehand, but I don&#39;t know who it could have been.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> What about you? What are you three doing here?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> We came to tour Santa Island!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yeah! There were some posters on the wall that said, \u201CYou can be Santa too!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I found the posters in question. It wasn&#39;t hard; whoever put them up wasn&#39;t shy about using any available surface.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Now I remember.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I saw that same Santa slogan, got a bad feeling about it, and promptly chose to ignore it.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That&#39;s when it happened. Somebody came up to me and said...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> \u201CHow could you just ignore it? That&#39;s so mean!\u201D</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> And you know the rest.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Right. I remember they sounded kind of...girlish and not girlish at the same time?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> They had a cute voice. At least, I think they did...</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> I can say this much for sure: whoever did this was not a child.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> I also take issue with Boudica&#39;s use of \u201Ccute.\u201D</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> This person&#39;s voice was cute, yes, but I feel like there was also something distinctly...uncute about it.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Aww, come on! It was totally cute!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I&#39;m...not sure what to make of it.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I think it did sound cute, but it also sounded like the voice of a born troublemaker.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (What is this? Ethereal profiling?)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> What about you, um, Nightingale? Do you still insist you&#39;re not Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Obviously.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Santa is a demon who goes around giving out candy in the dead of night. He is the enemy of children and dentists everywhere.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> That&#39;s so far off the mark I don&#39;t even know where to begin!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Santa Claus isn&#39;t a demon at all! He&#39;s...um...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Reindeer! How would you describe Santa?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s hard to put into words...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess I&#39;d say Santa gives people hopes and dreams?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> It IS hard to put into words, isn&#39;t it? In the end, it all comes down to feeling!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yeah. It&#39;s like how we just know when we have the perfect chance to kill somebody.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We&#39;d guess any Assassin probably knows what that&#39;s like.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That sounds like the unconscious feeling I get when I can just tell my next arrow is going to hit its target.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> That&#39;s how I know you must be Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> But you still can&#39;t accept who you are. That&#39;s so sad!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Yes, it is. If you ask me, being Santa Claus is the greatest job in the world.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Trust me! Getting to be Santa is a biiig honor and you should be proud!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yay, presents\u266A We wonder what we&#39;re gonna get this year\u266A</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...What is it you three want for Christmas? Is it sweets?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Sweets would be great, of course, but really, we&#39;d be happy with anything.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> After all, presents are the stuff of love, hopes, and dreams!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Love, hopes, and dreams, huh?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Those are all very important. But presents are supposed to be strictly material things, correct?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> You&#39;re not wrong. Kids do love getting practical gifts.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It&#39;s a conundrum every parental figure has to deal with.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> You think? I&#39;ve always believed it&#39;s the thought that counts when it comes to gifts.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> That holds true whether those thoughts are affectionate or spiteful.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> I do not think I want to imagine a present given out of spite.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> So what you&#39;re saying is, there&#39;s more to the Santa Claus class than going around giving candy to children.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That&#39;s right. A lot more.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Wait a second. Are you uncomfortable around kids?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Are you?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...A moment, please.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I assure you, I do not dislike or otherwise shun children. I have no negative feelings whatsoever toward them.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> However... Um...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I get it. Some feelings, you just can&#39;t put into words.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Anyway, now that we&#39;ve snapped out of it, we should really get back and start getting ready for Christmas.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Sounds good to me.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> How about you three? You can stay and continue your tour if you want, but it could get a little dangerous.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We wanna go home too!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I agree. Every child has the right to wait patiently for presents, whether they&#39;re naughty or nice.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> I was hoping to find Santa Island Mask here, since this place is called Santa Island and all...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> But I guess going back home works too!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Hey, if you two run into a man with a mask, please tell him I&#39;m doing well!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I still don&#39;t believe I&#39;m the next Santa Claus\u2013or at least, I don&#39;t think so\u2013but all right, I will.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Okay Master, now that we&#39;ve successfully eradicated the disease here, let&#39;s go look for the next group of patients.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh... You mean with that umbrella?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Yes, why not? If you like, I would be glad to transport you on my umbrella.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Just make sure you hold on to me tight.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Oh! Wait, Florence. There&#39;s one last thing I want to ask you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> \u201CFlorence\u201D? Very well. What is it?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Would you be so kind as to tell me how you feel about children some time?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I am a hero of children everywhere, after all!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Hey, Jeanne? Are you sure she&#39;s this year&#39;s Santa?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Absolutely!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> As the last-last-last Santa Claus myself, I can spot another Santa with one-hundred-percent certainty!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> So I can tell you for sure that Nightingale is this year&#39;s Santa!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Looks like she still hasn&#39;t come to terms with it, though.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> Maybe not, but it also seems that your words had an effect on her.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Well, I don&#39;t know about that.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> She&#39;s a smart lady. I&#39;m sure she would&#39;ve figured it out on her own at some point.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Ooh! That&#39;s the Santa who came before me!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Followed closely by a war elephant...</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> If I did not know better, I would have thought I was at a zoo.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> (No kidding. Especially with that Demon Boar on your shoulder...)</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Okay, everyone, let&#39;s go back to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> We have to get ready to welcome our new Santa Claus!</p><h2 id="section-3-christmas-present" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-christmas-present" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Christmas Present</h2><p><strong>Bad Guy:</strong> Mwahahaha!</p><p><strong>Bad Guy:</strong> We&#39;re gonna mess this Christmas party up real bad!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Specifically, we&#39;re gonna turn the Christmas cake into a kagami mochi rice cake and the Christmas tree into a New Year&#39;s kadomatsu decoration!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> We&#39;re also gonna turn the hot Santa cosplayers into hot kimono babes!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...On second thought, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter as long as they&#39;re hot!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hold it right there, dammit!</p><p><strong>Bad Guy:</strong> Who&#39;re you!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You wanna know who I am?

No way would I want her sticking me with that!)</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hmm. Unexpected intruders though you may be, it seems we are obligated to welcome you as a fellow Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Then you all claim to be Santa Claus as well?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Absolutely!

You might be.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Perhaps I am the sort of Santa Claus you describe.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> My job is also to deliver hopes and dreams\u2013things that we need to ensure tomorrow will be better than today.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Perhaps you know what I mean, Master? Surely you&#39;ve heard me say the word dozens of times by now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you talking about health?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you mean health?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Health.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> If I am truly Santa Claus, then health is the only gift I will give.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Damn, that&#39;s a good motive... Now I feel bad about mine.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Me too.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Santa Claus as the protector of health! What a wonderful idea!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I agree.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Specifically, I&#39;m planning to give out medicine instead of candy.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAll:</strong> Wait, what?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> That&#39;s right. Medicine.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> But don&#39;t worry. This medicine will still taste perfectly sweet!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Who cares!?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> I-I take it all back! That&#39;s a terrible idea! Nobody would ever dream about getting medicine for a present!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter how sweet it tastes! Medicine and candy are completely different things!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ... ...Really?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Is that true?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Unfortunately... I&#39;m afraid I have to agree with them.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Do you think so too, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s a real conundrum for sure, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, probably most kids would rather get candy, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Ah yes, the classic Santa quandary. Should a present be what the recipient wants, or something the recipient needs?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Truly a dilemma for the ages.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> And you mean to tackle it head-on, do you? Hmm.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I applaud your bravery, Nightingale. The way of the Santa Claus you have chosen may be the most difficult there is.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Does that mean you think my notions about gift-giving are mistaken?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter what I think. Our battle will decide who&#39;s right and wrong.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Go on, A\u015Bvatth\u0101man! Take up your arms!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Uh, okay. I guess Santa Clause can&#39;t back down from a fight, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Something tells me he doesn&#39;t really know what Santa Claus is about, either...)</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Very well, Mr. Caesar.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> It seems you know what lies beyond the way of the Santa.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> So if fighting this battle will allow me to learn that as well...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...then I am happy to accept, one Santa Claus to another!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...So, which one do we root for now?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> G-good luck, you two! May the best Santa win!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Medicine or candy... Medicine or candy... She did say the medicine would be sweet... Oh, which one&#39;s the right choice?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Argh, I can&#39;t make up my mind! Why do I always get stuck with the hard decisions!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Aw crap! I ran outta Santa Power!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...Wait. Why&#39;d I wanna be Santa again?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I think that takes us more into existential questions than we really have time for...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Well, that&#39;s easy enough, A\u015Bvatth\u0101man.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> It&#39;s because I was using my own Santa Power to...encourage you towards that end.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> So you were using me? Huh!? Is that what you&#39;re saying?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But think back on your experiences, and be honest: Didn&#39;t you enjoy being Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Hell no I...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> You know what? I did!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Being Santa was a ton of fun!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I especially liked how the audience got all excited whenever I transformed, though I still don&#39;t know why!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Hey, there ain&#39;t a red-blooded male around who hasn&#39;t dreamed about bein&#39; a transformin&#39; superhero at least once.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...Huh? What about my Golden Huge Bear armor?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> That is a thing, but everyone knows the big mecha is second place compared to bein&#39; able to TRANSFORM!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I can technically transform, but it&#39;s not anywhere near as cool as when you do it.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself, Fuuma Kotarou. We&#39;re still us, no matter what we look like.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> So be proud of what you got, dammit!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> O-okay!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> So what do you transform into, anyway?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> A grotesque, red-skinned monster about two-hundred and sixteen centimeters tall.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I can still think when I&#39;m in that form, but I can&#39;t pull my punches anymore since I&#39;m basically half-mad.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Ah, that&#39;s no problem. There were guys with transformations like that back in my day, too!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> You don&#39;t say!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> (\u201CNo problem\u201D my ass. If Raikou ever catches Kotarou like that, his head&#39;ll be on the floor faster than you can say \u201Cgolden\u201D...)</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Well, Nightingale? Did you learn anything from our little t\xEAte-\xE0-t\xEAte?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...No. If anything, I feel like I now understand Santa Claus less than ever.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Other Santas provide children with hopes, dreams, candy, and gifts.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> But if I were Santa Claus, the only thing I would offer is medicine.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I have no idea what the right answer is.

Then shall I skip over its summary?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d appreciate that, thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why don&#39;t we go over it just to be sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Very well.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Then as you&#39;ll recall, Scrooge has three fateful encounters that inspire him to turn over a new leaf and reconcile with his nephew and clerk...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Of course. It is a fairly old story, after all.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Very well then, here&#39;s the short and simple version.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Ebenezer Scrooge, a rich and notoriously miserly old merchant, is visited by three spirits on Christmas Eve:</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> They show him how he became so coldhearted in his past, the effects his cruel policies are having on his clerk&#39;s family in the present...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...and how the path he is on now will lead to him dying alone and unloved in the future.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong> You remember this parrot, don&#39;t you? This is where you were born.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong> That lonesome boy reading a book by the low fire over there is you.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong> Of course, at this point in your life, you still had hopes and dreams.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong> But over time...</p><p><strong>Past:</strong> ...you changed. Oh, how you changed.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong> You made a big show about how you were no longer a child, and parted ways with the woman you loved.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong> That choice, Scrooge, has made you who you are now.</p><p><strong>Present:</strong> Your greed and cunning made you rich, but at the expense of everyone around you.</p><p><strong>Present:</strong> Your clerk is just barely scraping by thanks to your refusal to pay him a living wage.</p><p><strong>Present:</strong> He can&#39;t even afford treatment for his third son, Tiny Tim. But that is of little matter to you, hm?</p><p><strong>Present:</strong> If they&#39;re going to die, they had better do it, and ease the burden of surplus population.</p><p><strong>Present:</strong> Isn&#39;t that what you told those guys who came asking you for donations to help feed poor, hungry children?</p><p><strong>Present:</strong> Well, Uncle Scrooge?</p><p><strong>Future:</strong> (This ghost remains silent, yet its intent is clear. Behold your future, Scrooge.)</p><p><strong>Future:</strong> (It sneers as if to say you have no one to love, and no one who loves you.)</p><p><strong>Future:</strong> (Its stare causes you pain and suffering, just as you have spent your life causing pain and suffering.)</p><p><strong>Future:</strong> (It merely watches, idly, as your body is stripped of its clothing, leaving you in nothing more than threadbare underwear.)</p><p><strong>Future:</strong> (Beneath its gaze, you realize you leave nothing behind but a cold, rotting corpse.)</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> And so, Scrooge&#39;s three fateful encounters inspire him to turn over a new leaf and reconcile with his nephew and clerk.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Today, it&#39;s believed that the publication of \u201CA Christmas Carol\u201D in 1843...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...directly led to the popularization of Christmas celebrations in England as we know them today.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> The day of the Nativity is a very important one, both for soldiers and for myself.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I might have even celebrated it traditionally when I was still a child.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> But that all went away once I began living my adult life.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Truthfully, my childhood memories are so hazy that I just can&#39;t be sure if I celebrated it or not.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> The idea of an old man who embodies the holiday, whether you know him as Santa Claus or Father Christmas, hadn&#39;t yet been established in my time.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> So even though I have lived in two very different times that share Christmas as a major event...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...I still understand neither Christmas nor Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> At least, that&#39;s how it seems to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That doesn&#39;t change the fact that you ARE Santa Claus now.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> If you say so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve figured it out.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Hm? Hold on.

Who in the world is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was wondering about that myself, Senpai. If we rule out Caesar, which seems like a safe bet at this point...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...that leaves schemers like Professor Moriarty and troublemakers like Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But since all the usual suspects are confirmed to be in Chaldea right now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...then who could possibly be left?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is only a guess on my part, but\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Hmm.

This is something I need to decide for myself.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Whether I&#39;m Santa Claus or not, my work will remain the same.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I will try to heal, amputate, and save as many people as I can.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My path will never change, no matter if I live or die.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...No, that&#39;s not right. It&#39;s okay if my path changes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No matter how much it may veer off in unexpected ways...it will still end up at the same destination.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And in that case, I know full well what my answer is.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> My answer is...yes.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I&#39;ve made up my mind. I&#39;m going to be Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong> Brilliant, yes! But of course, that also means we need to make sure you&#39;re up to it.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Agreed.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> After all, you can&#39;t have a Santa Claus without a Santa Claus arbiter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-is that\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A rose Black Key!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> Good to see you again, everyone. It&#39;s been quite a while since last we met, hasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> What&#39;s that? You remember seeing me in the summer? Hahaha, I see your flights of fancy are as elaborate as ever.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> Who clauses the Santa Claus? I do, says the cuckoo.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> In other words, I&#39;m here to judge whether you&#39;re fit to be Santa.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Jeanne Lily said to tell you she&#39;s doing well.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> Hahaha, I&#39;m fully aware. But I&#39;m glad to hear it all the same.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> We&#39;ll be taking part in your judgment too. Besides, I want to make sure I haven&#39;t lost my touch.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong> I was hoping Astraea and swimsuit-Martha would join us too...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong> ...but they said that would be overkill, yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d rather face an army from the Demon Realm than all five of you at once.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> I agree. A lineup like that would be much too dangerous.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> That&#39;s why I thought we should keep those two in a separate block.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What would that be? Some kind of fistfighting world championship?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> Hahaha, a championship like that is the last place I&#39;d ever want to fight. Between punches, takedowns, submission holds, and flying kicks, they&#39;d have every approach covered perfectly.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> At any rate, we are the ones to whom you&#39;ll need to prove your dedication.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> Now...show us how much you&#39;re willing to fight for your Santa Clausdom!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I still don&#39;t know why you&#39;re wearing that mask, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, but I&#39;ll be glad to face you all the same!</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> Please stick to Santa Island Mask here, if you don&#39;t mind!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> This is quite a surprise.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> I see you&#39;re still as strong as ever, even with a new Archer Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> And above all...</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> ...I hear your dedication to being Santa Claus loud and clear.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> To be honest...I still don&#39;t feel confident that I can be a Santa Claus beloved by all, but\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I see. So that is what has been plaguing you.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Then hear me, the first Santa Claus of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Pay it no mind.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Dreams, hope, love... We all think we know what they look like, but no two people share the same definitions for these things.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> So if you truly believe that medicine is love, then that is the gift you should give.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> (I don&#39;t know... Medicine feels like a real stretch. Then again, sweet cough syrup does sound pretty yummy...)</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s totally right, Nightingale.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...Right. I&#39;d almost forgotten.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> You believed in me right from the start, didn&#39;t you, Master?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> You never had any doubt that I could be Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Oh, yes. Now that I&#39;ve won this battle, does that mean I&#39;m officially Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong> Not just yet, I&#39;m afraid.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong> Astolfo still has the last key. Er, the last bell, I mean.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Once you obtain that bell for yourself...</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> ...then you can proudly declare that you are this year&#39;s Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Make sure you do your best. I know I certainly did.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> I&#39;ll be rooting for you on Jeanne Alter Santa Lily&#39;s behalf.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I still don&#39;t know what connection you have to Santa Claus, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> My name is Santa Island Mask.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...At any rate, I appreciate your support.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry to interrupt, but would you mind ringing those bells for me?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> You mean like this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Perfect. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that I&#39;ve calibrated the sensors, I can see there&#39;s an almost identical ringing sound not too far from there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Which means\u2013</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Now I see.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> So that&#39;s where we&#39;ll find Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Come then, Master, let&#39;s be on our way!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right! Time for the last flight of the event!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong> Well, now that that&#39;s over with...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong> What say we all go watch the finale, yes?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> You&#39;re still planning to go after all, huh? But yes, that sounds good to me too.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hup!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Well? What happened with Santa Claus, dammit!?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Oh, just what we need. Another loudmouth.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hey, why don&#39;t you go\u2013</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> Now, now, no need for that.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> We can all go see whether Nightingale ends up as the next Santa or not.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Isn&#39;t it already a foregone conclusion?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> I&#39;m not so sure.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> From where I stand, it looks to me like she&#39;s still wrestling with something.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> Whether she&#39;s able to get past it or not, well, that&#39;s up to her.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ah c&#39;mon, Amakusa, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fi\u2013</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ugh, fine, Something-Something Mask. Whatever. Let&#39;s just freaking go already!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> In that, we agree. I too would like to witness the birth of the next Santa Claus myself.</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong> AMAKUSANTAAA!!! (Translation: I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here.

Though I still can&#39;t quite believe it.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hey, none of that!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Anyway, I was thinking, and you know what?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Maybe I could just be Santa myself!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Wat.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> H-hold on. Just back up a minute.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Didn&#39;t you bring all these Santas here to fight to determine which of them was the true Santa?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I sure did!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But while I was hanging around waiting for them to hash it out, I started thinking, \u201CWait. Maybe I&#39;m already Santa!\u201D</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Gah! I forgot how quickly things go off the rails with you!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> No way! Absolutely not!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> You only just became a Saber! You can&#39;t be Santa Claus too!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Sure I can!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> First I was a Rider, now I&#39;m a Saber and Santa Claus too! It&#39;s all part of the Astolfo brand, baby!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Now you&#39;re just being greedy!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Come on, Stolfo, be reasonable. Remember what they say about people who chase after two hares at once?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> There&#39;s no possible way this can end well. You know that, right?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Why not!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I became a Saber no problem. What&#39;s the harm in being Santa too!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But your outfit&#39;s not even red! It&#39;s black!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Yeah... Well, my hair&#39;s pink! Close enough!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Besides, the very first Santa Servant basically wore all black too, right!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Okay, yes, that&#39;s technically true, but still!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Come on, what&#39;s the big deal? I just wanna be Santa!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And now I am!!!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> No, you&#39;re not!!!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Arghhh, this is so frustrating! Somebody! Anybody! Please, stop Stolfo before this gets out of hand!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> On it!</p><hr><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Master? Is that you!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Master!? Where is [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she]? What page is [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] on?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Oh Stolfo. I see your language function is still pretty glitchy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey hey.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Master!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And...Huh? Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Didn&#39;t you say you didn&#39;t wanna be Santa?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Yes, I did.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> However...I see now that I was unknowingly being selfish.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hmm. I see.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But, um, didn&#39;t you also say that if you did become Santa Claus, you&#39;d be handing out\u2013</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Medicine? That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> It will taste sweet and delicious, just like candy... but it will still be medicine through and through.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Aw come on, you can&#39;t give away medicine as a present! That&#39;s just so...boring!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Yes, I agree.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> That&#39;s why I originally declined the offer to be Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> But I realized something thanks to my experiences here on Santa Island.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> There&#39;s nothing wrong with being boring.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Huh? Come on, you can&#39;t be serious.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> But I am. For the medicine I give away will be an expression of my love.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I will of course be sad if anyone chooses to refuse it, but I will not force it upon them if they don&#39;t want it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Whatever the children do with my gifts is entirely up to them.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But I thought you didn&#39;t even like children.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nightingale doesn&#39;t have anything against kids.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Huh? I don&#39;t get it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> How can I put this...?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I admit that I don&#39;t always know how to behave around children, but that isn&#39;t because I dislike them.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I was just...afraid of them. You see, in my time, children frequently died much too young.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That&#39;s true in pretty much any time.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> It&#39;s why those who are strong enough to fight will always have a duty to keep children safe.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I&#39;m scared of children. They&#39;re so small, and weak, and fragile.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> That&#39;s why I want to give them medicine. I want them to be hale and hearty, so that they no longer have to fear the specter of death.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> That way...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I might one day be able to give a gift... to the girl I never got to be.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hmm... I don&#39;t get what you&#39;re talking about at all, but I can still tell you&#39;re really passionate about it!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But I dunno, I still feel like something&#39;s missing!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Oh, give it up already, Stolfo. Or if you can&#39;t do that, why not just fight her now?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Yeah, good idea! Okay, let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa (Archer):</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Astolfo (Saber):</strong> But I&#39;m gonna lose!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Ughhh.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Waaah! Okay, fine! I&#39;m just gonna pull out ALL the stops then!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Astolfo is gathering up magical energy! It looks like\u2013</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> All I gotta do is ring this bell, and I&#39;ll get both stronger AND more Santa...um...Santay! Maybe!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> So this is the power of the true Santa bell. Impressive. All my bell does is make a little jingling sound.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I don&#39;t know how this works either, but I do know that this bell is amaaazing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You know, there&#39;s something about that bell...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is it just me, or does that bell look kind of familiar?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> No matter. I cannot afford to lose this fight!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Now that I have decided to be Santa Claus, I refuse to turn away from my chosen path!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> That&#39;s the spirit!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Um... I guess I don&#39;t need to be here anymore, so...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Aw come on, Mante, I was counting on you to join me!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Ughhh! Okay, okay!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> It&#39;s my duty to help my fellow paladins, and I can&#39;t go back on that now!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Sorry about this, Master!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Then this is it. The final battle to determine who will be the true Santa!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> You or me, Santa baby! Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Noooooo! I loooooost!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (Sigh) What a surprise.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hey! What do you mean, \u201Cwhat a surprise\u201D!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...Huh? I feel like...I&#39;m getting weaker...?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I&#39;m back to normal again!? Why? How? WHYYY!? HOOOOOOW!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Hmm. I wonder...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Maybe it was that bell that turned you from a Rider into a Saber, Stolfo?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Really? Then, it wasn&#39;t because the heavens saw how hard I&#39;ve been working and decided to grant my wish?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Pretty sure that wasn&#39;t it.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Take a closer look.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Ah.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Ah.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Aaaaaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yup. It&#39;s a Holy Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now it all makes sense!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So that bell gathering magical energy was actually a just Holy Grail disguised as a bell!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Then, we were spending precious magical energy resources just so someone could pretend to be Santa Claus!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Okay, I&#39;m not recording anything in our archives about this mess. If word got out, Chaldea&#39;s reputation would be ruined!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> So that&#39;s what was going on. I turned into a Saber &#39;cause I&#39;m always going around wishing I could be one!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> (Man, I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t wish for something crass, like being a billionaire!)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Now I see.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So Stolfo lost his Saber powers when Nightingale officially became the bell&#39;s new owner!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Aw man. I guess life just never goes how you want!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Are you sure, Astolfo?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Bwa!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Wh-what&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> No way. I&#39;m a Saber again!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> H-hold on a minute! Did you just use the Holy Grail&#39;s power!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Yes, I did. Though only enough to change Astolfo&#39;s Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Any Holy Grails we find are supposed to be turned over to Chaldea anyway.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> And above all, I didn&#39;t gather this Santa Power myself.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I may have decided to be Santa Claus...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...but I have no intention of using this power to jump straight to the conclusion.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Now that I have made my decision, I&#39;m going to see it through to the end fair and square.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Wow, so mature...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> No wonder she was the world&#39;s greatest nurse... I&#39;ve never seen anyone else with so much willpower.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I&#39;m perfectly happy to continue using this replica. Besides, I&#39;ve grown rather fond of its timbre.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> (Sniff) Thanks, Nightingale! You&#39;re the best!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> (Sigh) I guess all I did was mess everything up again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t say that.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> If it weren&#39;t for you, I don&#39;t think I would have ever decided to be Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> If not for you, I would never have come to Santa Island or ever looked back on who I used to be.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> So...thank you.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Whoooa! I can&#39;t believe you just blushed!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> You&#39;re so cute!!!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Cute!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Wow... That blush could stop a thousand ships in their tracks...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She really is cute when she blushes, isn&#39;t she?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Ahem!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> So, Master. I apologize for asking this on such short notice...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...but would it be okay if I continued my Santa Claus training for a while longer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Don&#39;t forget about me! If there&#39;s anything I can do to help with your training, just say the word!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> After all, I&#39;m the greatest Saber who ever lived, so I&#39;m sure I can be of service!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Just don&#39;t get carried away this time, Stolfo. Remember, you&#39;re only a Saber now thanks to her.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> In the meantime, I&#39;d be glad to help out too!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;m not gonna do shit, but I did bring along a bunch of goody-goodies who wanna help.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Seriously, though. Don&#39;t expect me to help. &#39;Cause I won&#39;t. No freakin&#39; way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (She&#39;s totally going to help out...)</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> As Chaldea&#39;s original Santa, I am honor bound to aid my successor.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong> I trust my answer goes without saying?

You&#39;ve been admonishing me for a long time now, haven&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Yes, I have.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I&#39;m a hero of children everywhere.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> So I have no mercy for anyone who mistreats children.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Not even if that child\u2013</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Is myself.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Then I suppose that makes me Scrooge from \u201CA Christmas Carol.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> He was miserly, while I had other goals I cared about more.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> But whatever our excuses, the result was the same. He mistreated others&#39; children, while I mistreated myself.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> That&#39;s right. But as long as you understand that now, that&#39;s enough for me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Although, in that case...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Does this mean you, Astolfo, and Master were my three Christmas spirits?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Oh my. I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way, but I love it! What a wonderful interpretation!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Though of course, I doubt Astolfo and Master had any idea of the roles they were playing.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I&#39;m the only one who was consciously testing you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I would never dream of saying anything to you as your usual self.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I can&#39;t even count how many lives you must have saved, after all.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> But once I knew you were going to be Santa Claus...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...I thought it was time you finally faced who you were as a child.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> That&#39;s why I tormented you by showing you this dream over and over.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Florence.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> That&#39;s quite all right. In fact, I&#39;m grateful to you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t be here now if it wasn&#39;t for you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> So thank you, White Knight, hero of children everywhere.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> You&#39;re welcome, Ms. Nightingale! You know, you really are as pretty as the bird you&#39;re named for!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Anyway, that&#39;s all I had to say, so now it&#39;s time to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Besides, I have to wake up early to see what you brought me, Santa!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Um...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I pick my former self up and hold her tight, marveling at how tiny I used to be...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...and say something I may or may not have once said long, long ago.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Happy words\u2013Something every child deserves to hear.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Merry Christmas, Florence Nightingale.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> (Gasp)...!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong> Merry Christmas, Florence Nightingale.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Merry...
