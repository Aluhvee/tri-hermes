Go stand in the corner.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Aw, come on. What are you, a prefect or something?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> A prefect...? Hmm. Yes, perhaps I am.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Osakabehime once told me that there are only two positions for those with white school uniforms like me: prefect, or student council president.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right! The classic trope from Japanese schools!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fo fooou! (Special Translation: Uh-oh. Mash&#39;s common sense is becoming dangerously close to UNcommon!)</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...But never mind that now. We just discovered a new minute Singularity.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Mash, Da Vinci asked me to give you a message.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> She said she would like you to monitor Fujimaru during this mission.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh? I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on, but I know I can trust a prefect!

Good, that will save us time.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Speaking of time, this Singularity isn&#39;t quite situated during the Age of Gods, but it&#39;s close.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Ughhh, why does it have to be THERE of all places...? I&#39;ve got nothing but bad memories of that place...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It was that hard for you there?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...I actually think I had a bad dream about Aeaea Island just the other day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well... Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Ha!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> You can&#39;t fool me. You just want to take it easy, right? Well, so do I!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Ooh, ooh, me too.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Besides, Artemis isn&#39;t even here now, and I sure can&#39;t do anything to help on my own.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Putting you aside for the moment, Jason... What happened to your goddess, Orion?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> All the goddesses are having their own little get-together today, so in the meantime, I&#39;m a free bear. Uh, man.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Then that&#39;s all the more reason we can&#39;t leave you behind.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> If anything, taking you along will make it much easier to keep an eye on you.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> What&#39;s that supposed to mean!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Sounds eminently reasonable to me.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> That&#39;s enough, you two.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> If Circe doesn&#39;t feel like coming, we can&#39;t force her.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I&#39;ll go.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Will you now, Georgios? It&#39;s not every day I see you go on a mission.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I was gonna ask Chiron, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m afraid my presence could cause Jason undue anxiety.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I have the feeling he would get so worked up trying to show me how much he&#39;s grown that he would ultimately end up making avoidable mistakes.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> So if I may be so bold, I suggest you try asking Lord Georgios to go in my stead.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I have absolute faith in his ability to keep a party grounded, regardless of how chaotic its lineup may be.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Say whaaat!? Are you freaking kidding me!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Why would I get anxious just because Chiron was there!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Have you lot forgotten I&#39;m the one who captained the Argo through treacherous waters!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I know this might sound rich coming from me, but I can totally see you screwing up like that.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Agreed. I can imagine such a scene all too easily.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Well, bully for you!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> But, never mind that for now. So, what&#39;s it gonna be, Circe?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Just so you know, I got no problem whatsoever with you staying behind.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> It&#39;s just a minute Singularity, after all, so three Servants ought to be plenty.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> What about me?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> What, you thought I was counting you? Do I look like a guy who needs help from a talking teddy bear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Orion&#39;s more levelheaded than you&#39;d think.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Oho, very perceptive of you, Master.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> It&#39;s true. I&#39;m very good at taking a step back and seeing the larger picture.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Uh... As for me, um... I&#39;m sorry, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay if you&#39;re not feeling up to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> No, wait... I need some time to think.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> (Uh... Why&#39;s Ms. Queen Witch just sitting on a corner of the bed shaking like a leaf?)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Well, ready or not, we&#39;re leaving.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m sure we can make do just fine without a queen witch or two.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong></p><h1 id="wha" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wha" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Wha...!?</h1><p><strong>Circe:</strong> C-c-come on, Jason, don&#39;t be rude.

I still need more time to\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That felt even faster than usual...</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong> We could&#39;ve waited all day and it wouldn&#39;t have made any difference. Now come on, Queen Witch.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I knew I had a bad feeling about this. Ugh...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Hmm. This certainly is a lovely place.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Just look at the colors of that beautiful Greek sea. I&#39;d better get a picture of it.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> You know, I&#39;ve been wondering this for a while, Georgios: Where&#39;d you get that camera, anyway?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I can&#39;t say. Photography became a favored hobby of mine before I&#39;d even realized it had happened.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Perhaps I wished for it upon winning a Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I kid, of course.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ......Right! Of course! (I can never tell when serious guys like this are joking.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Oh. That didn&#39;t take long.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks like there&#39;s a Servant reading not too far from you.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> So we&#39;ve got a Rogue Servant, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. They seem to be an unknown Heroic Spirit that isn&#39;t registered in Chaldea&#39;s Spirit Origin graph.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> We don&#39;t yet know if they&#39;re friend or foe, so we&#39;ll need to approach them carefully.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Yeah, sure, makes sense.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Though you know, a Rogue Servant&#39;s a hell of a thing to call someone.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> What do you expect? They&#39;re not exactly wild Servants either, so what we call them should reflect that.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Now, musclehead types like Atalante or Penthesilea? Those are what I&#39;d call wild Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Jason? I feel I should let you know that both Atalante and Penthesilea are here in the Command Room...</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> Congratulations, Jason. You have earned yourself a very warm welcome indeed on your return.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Please, permit me to be among those who welcomes you back.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Tell me, Jason, what role in such a party appeals to you? A live archery target, or a crash test dummy?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Dammit Mash, why didn&#39;t you tell me who else was there with you sooner!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Are you TRYING to get me killed!?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Couldn&#39;t you just...not say anything mean?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Who asked you, Mr. Rational!? I can&#39;t help it if I have opinions I need to share!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> That sort of thing is exactly what people mean by \u201Cputting one&#39;s foot in one&#39;s mouth.\u201D</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> (Sighhh)... I am so not feeling up for this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is everything okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oh, yeah, don&#39;t worry. This is just a mental problem, not a physical one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you really have that many bad memories associated with Aeaea Island?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...No, most of them are pretty good.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> But there is one really bad memory that kind of feels like it&#39;s tainting all the good ones...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> You mean Odysseus?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Cripes! Anyone ever told you you can be a real insensitive jerk sometimes!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Tons.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Then why the hell haven&#39;t you done anything about it by now!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hey, it was just a matter of time until it came to light, anyway. I mean, your legend&#39;s one of the most famous around.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> You know it too, right, Master?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> !!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You bet.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Craaap.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I guess that at least means I don&#39;t have to tell you about it, huh? Now come on, let&#39;s keep moving!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Long story short, she basically just got her ass dumped by the guy she was in love with.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Did you have to put it that bluntly!? Ugh, guys like you are exactly why I hate human royalty!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not really...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Great! Trust me, Piglet, you&#39;re better off not knowing!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Well, I suppose I can take the opportunity to fill you in.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Don&#39;t. You. Dare.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> It was after the Trojan War had come to an end.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Odysseus had set sail to return to his homeland...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You. Little. Bastard.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...only for him and his crew to end up adrift at sea.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Eventually, they all washed up here on Aeaea Island.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> But unfortunately for them, that misanthropic queen witch there had been changing every human who set foot on her island into wild animals.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Boars, lions, wolves, you name it.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Odysseus&#39;s crew fared no better, as she turned them all into pigs.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Enraged, Odysseus turned his sword on her, nearly killing her, and she made some quick apologies.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Urk, ack, gah... (Writhing in agony)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> After that, Odysseus agreed to stay with her in exchange for her turning his crew back to normal.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ...Damn, now that I think about it, you&#39;re a lot better at cutting deals than I realized.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> THAT&#39;S what you&#39;re impressed with!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> However, Odysseus was already married to a woman named Penelope.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> So once he&#39;d recovered his strength on Aeaea Island, he decided to resume his journey homeward.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong></p><p>(Curling up in the fetal position)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> And that&#39;s when her ass got dumped!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Gee, thanks for explaining the most painful episode of my life in excruciating detail, guys! How would you like me to turn you into pigs in gratitude!?</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hey, Master, is that the Rogue Servant over there?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> &#39;Cause he doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s doing too good, what with being sprawled out on the ground and all.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Those Demonic Beasts sniffing around him don&#39;t look like good news, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> W-we&#39;d better go save him!</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Agreed. Come, let us be on our way!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hang on. I still have something to sa\u2013</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Will you just help us already!?</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> There we go. All right, everyone.</p><p><strong>All:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Say cheese.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Okay, I know I smiled on reflex, but was that picture really necessary?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> You can&#39;t put a price on memories.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> (Sigh) Don&#39;t you think we should wake that Servant up and make sure he&#39;s okay before we start arguing about photo ops?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I swear, you heroes never think about anyone but yourselves. Hey, are you okay?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Nn? Nnnnnn?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Uh, n-no, nothing. Wh-why do you ask?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Aha. So his head is shaped funny because he&#39;s got a helmet on.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> We&#39;d better take it off him before he drowns.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Come on, Mr. Georgios, give us a hand.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> All right. Up we go.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> N...gh... Wh-where am I...?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Oh hey, you&#39;re still alive.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Who...are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re from Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Chaldea...?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Maybe you&#39;ve never heard of Chaldea, but what about Jason and Orion?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Yes, I know those names. They are both legendary heroes... Is that who you two are?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Not me. My name is Georgios. This tiny bear is Orion.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> And the man standing there with his arms crossed, ready to turn tail and run at a moment&#39;s notice...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...though you wouldn&#39;t know it to look at him, of course...is Jason.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Hey!

Where did Circe go?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Circe?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks like Circe snuck away when you weren&#39;t looking.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Geez, the hell was she thinking?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Okay, you guys better stay here. Master and I&#39;ll go bring her back.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Ugh, what a slacker.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Circe...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Circe is the famous Queen Witch of Aeaea Island. We&#39;ll have her take a look at you.</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...For the moment, I decided to run away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t know how long that moment&#39;s going to last...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...but I had to get away from there, just so I could breathe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Ugh... Great, just great. How come it&#39;s always the BAD feelings that turn out to be right!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I always figured he would show up eventually.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I mean, he&#39;s a hero. A hero&#39;s hero, at that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was only a matter of time until he ended up getting summoned.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I thought I&#39;d be fine as long as I avoided running into him...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Why here, of all places?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Why did I have to find him on Aeaea Island?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For that matter...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Wait. Why did I run away in the first place!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> It&#39;s not as though I did anything wrong.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> And besides, I&#39;m Fujimaru&#39;s Servant now.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Man, I really thought I had this stuff all sorted out.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oh shut up!

I can tell you his True Name.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> How would you know that?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Circe told us. His name&#39;s Odysseus.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> As in, the famous hero of the Trojan War.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> So he is Odysseus. That would certainly explain his exceptional skill.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Huh? Tell me you guys didn&#39;t fight him while we were gone.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> We didn&#39;t have to. I am a warrior.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I can immediately tell how skilled someone is just from the way they carry themselves.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...I see. So my name is Odysseus?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Has hearing your name shaken loose any memories?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I&#39;m afraid not.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I feel as though I&#39;m trapped in an impenetrable labyrinth.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Odysseus... It still doesn&#39;t feel as though it&#39;s truly my name.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Well, this isn&#39;t good.

I&#39;m not the queen witch for nothing!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> That&#39;s not really something to be proud of.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Incidentally, your crew was no exception.

Pretty terrifying, right?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> No, not especially.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I try not to jump to conclusions before I&#39;ve examined all the evidence, especially when it comes to judging others.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m a shadow of history now. It would be meaningless to hold on to a grudge I held back when I was alive.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ... ...Hmph!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Circe?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Sorry, it&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I guess this just means...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...it doesn&#39;t mean anything to you anymore, does it?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I am afraid I cannot give you an answer, at least while I am not in possession of my memories.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Hehe. No wonder you&#39;re the best tactician in all of Achaea!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> There we go!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Now that the Demonic Beasts are gone, I can see the spell&#39;s traces more clearly.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> This way, straight ahead!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Great!

You mean with your wife, Lady Mede\u2013</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> EX-wife! Ex! She&#39;s her own person, and I&#39;m mine!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> I&#39;ve made it a point to live my life that way, and I&#39;m not about to change it now!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...He might not have his memories, but he&#39;s still the same guy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m upset, relieved, or both.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Though I guess I can say it&#39;s a relief to see that he didn&#39;t act any differently around me than he did anyone else.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He definitely treats me the same as everyone. ...Though in a way, that pisses me off, too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Ugh, I hate having all these complicated feelings.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...I see something.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> No way...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> This is your island. Do you have any idea what it is?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...No, I don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well, full disclosure, I do know that building...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> But I have no idea what it&#39;s doing here.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Hmm... This is becoming quite an interesting problem.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Piglet! Can you come here, please?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s up?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Take a look at this.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Do those stairs lead underground? Oh no. I&#39;ve got a very bad feeling about this!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Do you know what these stairs might be doing here, Circe?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I&#39;ve no idea! They were never here before!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> So we have a clear discrepancy between this place and the true Aeaea Island.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> It seems whoever&#39;s behind this is practically inviting us in. What do you think we should do, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll just have to see what&#39;s down there.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Anyone NOT want to go down there?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Yes! Me!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> In my opinion, do an about-face, leave this Singularity, and head right back home!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Ha ha ha, and what would that solve? Denied.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Tch.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Well, come on, an underground labyrinth? They couldn&#39;t be any more obvious about this being a trap if they tried.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> I don&#39;t need to go down there to know that.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Well, like it or not, going down there&#39;s our only choice.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Very well then, I&#39;ll scout ahead.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I&#39;ll bring up the rear.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Master, Circe, and Odysseus will stay in the middle, while Jason and Orion form the rear guard.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Hey, great. That sounds easy.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Jason, if you let me die, I WILL haunt the hell out of you.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Get out of my mind!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> All right, then let us be on our way. Would you give the order, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All hands, we&#39;re going in!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Understood. Go, go, go!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Why did you make me do that?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Nobody made you do anything!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Here we gooo!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Yeaaah!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Keep up, will ya!?</p><p><strong>All:</strong></p><h1 id="sorry" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sorry" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sorry.</h1><hr><h2 id="section-3-systematic-underground-labyrinth" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-systematic-underground-labyrinth" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Systematic Underground Labyrinth</h2><p><strong>???:</strong> Good, they&#39;re finally here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s about time.

My hand slipped!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Ugh, great, now I&#39;m soaked.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> What about your outfit? Are you decent?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Decent?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Psh. Who do you think I am?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I&#39;m Circe! Disciple of Hecate, and the queen witch of all Greece!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> There&#39;s no way I&#39;d ever be caught dead in see-through clothes!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I see. Or rather, I can&#39;t see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What happened!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry. I guess my heroic mind was a little too sharp in this case.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I can&#39;t believe it! Jason&#39;s actually apologizing!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Does that really count as an apology...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Anyway, why do you ask? Were you hoping to sneak a peek at my bare body or something?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> No, I wasn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I just didn&#39;t want a young maiden like yourself to suffer any humiliation.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...S-s-s-stupid iron man!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Did I say something wrong?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Eh, that&#39;s just how she is. Though I am starting to get a clearer picture of what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> What a lovely candid moment. Say cheese.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Piss off!!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, that&#39;s too bad.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I thought her inadvertently baring all would make him feel responsible and start to chip away at that brick wall...but I guess it&#39;s just not going to be that easy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But hey, at least they&#39;re getting along well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s true! This is wonderful! I&#39;m so glad I asked now!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> So what next?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Next... Hehehe. I think I might have just the thing.</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> We&#39;ve got another signboard here. What&#39;s this one say, Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> \u201CDestroy the paradox. That is the only way to the next room.\u201D</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> \u201CKeep moving forward without looking back.\u201D</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> The end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What paradox...?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Oh, hello. What are you all doing\u2013</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Please, you have to believe me. Both Shakespeare and that statue are lying liars!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> My door is the only one you can trust!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Me, a liar? Perish the thought.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Mephisto there is the liar. He and the statue both!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Therefore, it stands to reason that only my door can be trusted.</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong> Trust the gods... Trust this god...</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong> Both Mephisto and Shakespeare are lying liars...</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong> Trust the gods... The gods never lie...</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong> Which means my door is the one and only genuine article...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Don&#39;t ask me, Shielder.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> All I can say is that only one of these doors is the right one.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> So we have three people, each in front of a different door.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I suppose this means our task is to choose the correct one.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> But the only leads we have to go on are these three&#39;s testimonies...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> So this is the paradox.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Somebody here is lying, and somebody is telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Except...is that even possible when we don&#39;t know how many of them are liars?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Good question.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> For example, say that Mephistopheles is telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> By extension, that would mean that both Shakespeare and the statue are lying.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> However, the statue is also telling us that Mephistopheles and Shakespeare are the ones lying.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> And here, we have a fatal contradiction.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Because if the statue is lying...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...that would mean both Mephistopheles and Shakespeare are telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Indeed. And the same holds true for all of them.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> This results in a paradox. That is to say, there is no correct answer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Th-this is breaking my brain a bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> So even if one of them is a liar, and another one isn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...You&#39;re right. It just doesn&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Circe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I&#39;d like to know what you think.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hmm. Well, this is definitely a riddle.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> So the way I see it...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...whoever came up with this riddle&#39;s bound to be a natural-born jerkface of the highest degree.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Which means there&#39;s no point taking this at face value.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> The right answer...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...is to go back the way we came.</p><p><strong>All:</strong></p><h1 id="huh" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#huh" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Huh!?</h1><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Oh, on a different note:</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hey, Teach?

Once a photo op is gone, it&#39;s gone for good.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Aw maaan.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Circe, what do you mean we need to go back?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> It&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> The signboard&#39;s the real liar here. Those three are just a sideshow.</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> The signboard...? Aha, now I see.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> So by \u201CDestroy the paradox. That is the only way to the next room\u201D...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...it really means \u201CYou don&#39;t have to destroy the paradox. There&#39;s another way to the next room.\u201D</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> And by \u201CKeep moving forward without looking back\u201D...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...it really means \u201CTurn around and go back.\u201D</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> So everything is simply the reverse of how it seems. Apparently I was overthinking this.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Guess it was a tough problem for a stuffed shirt like you, huh?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Heh... I can&#39;t argue with that.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Though of course, I still can&#39;t say for myself whether I truly am a stuffed shirt or\u2013Hm?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Us, a sideshow!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> While I cannot deny the truth in your words, neither can I let you simply turn around and leave.</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong> I...don&#39;t really care either way...</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong> But I also don&#39;t like the idea of you guys leaving while thinking I&#39;m just a big joke...</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong> So I&#39;m going to crush you, god-style...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oh come on! Why&#39;re you giving us a hard time now!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Not one of you even likes exerting yourselves!</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong> As they say, there is an exception to every rule...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Here we go!

So I&#39;m Odysseus.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Did your memories come back?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Partially, yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Which parts are we talking about, exactly?</p><hr><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Well, I now know my name really is Odysseus.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> And I know that I fought in the Trojan War, which I just barely managed to survive.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...Of course, that&#39;s all from when I was still alive.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Though if nothing else, I&#39;ve also managed to recover my personality.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> What about me? Do you remember me now?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Hahaha. Sorry, still nothing there.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Well, that&#39;s okay. It might even be for the better that way.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> You think so?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Personally, I&#39;m still interested to know what sort of relationship we had when I was alive.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> All we did was hurt each other.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You&#39;d hurt me, I&#39;d hurt you, then we&#39;d do it all over again.

At least until he gets his memories back.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> The real question is what happens after that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What do you think&#39;s going on with Circe?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Good question.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as simple as her just hating him or missing him... Feelings can be complicated things.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Furthermore, as far as I know, Odysseus was a married man when they met.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Odysseus&#39;s wife waited a long, long time for him to come back to her.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Ah yes, Penelope.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> I heard she was practically swarmed by would-be suitors while she was waiting for Odysseus.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Wish I could&#39;ve got to know her...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> You would only have been wasting your time.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hey, I&#39;m no quitter!

That switch could&#39;ve been a bomb for all you knew!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> You know, this clarifies something I&#39;ve been mulling over for a while.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> At a glance, Arjuna might seem like the kind of guy who keeps things from getting out of hand...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...but he&#39;s actually the kind who goes around pouring gas on the fires of chaos, metaphorically speaking.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I always keep a clear head, and serve as a calm and collected leader for the others in my group.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> And the worst part is, he doesn&#39;t even realize it.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hmm... Nnn... Is this it...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> There we go.

But in the meantime, let&#39;s see how this goes.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I&#39;ll start by doubling my protective magical energy field.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Okay, Master, be right back!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> See you soo\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Bwah!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Ow ow ow ow! What the what!? The hell was that!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Damn.

But now what do we do?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Whoever set this room up obviously doesn&#39;t actually want us to clear it!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Come now, that&#39;s not true.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I recognize that beautiful voice...!</p><hr><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Good day, everyone.

You got a problem with that description?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Problems, no. Doubts, yes.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Oh my, I&#39;m so scared. You look like a hunter eyeing his prey. So you&#39;re a warrior with brains AND bravery, huh?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I swear, you human so-called heroes. I can&#39;t tell any difference between you and your everyday barbaric warrior.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why are you doing this?</p><hr><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> So, how would you like me to tell you how you can get through this room?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (She just straight up ignored [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her]!)</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> This trap\u2013I mean, trial, requires two people to work together in perfect sync.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> You&#39;ll need to both step on the same floor tile at the same time, and evade the lasers like you&#39;re dancing a waltz.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Here, I even wrote down the exact instructions for you. Take a moment to memorize them.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> G-geez, this looks pretty tough.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> It may be complicated, but it&#39;s not impossible. Trust me. I am a goddess, after all.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> That&#39;s funny, &#39;cause if there&#39;s one thing I know about goddesses, it&#39;s that they&#39;re NOT to be trusted.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Did you say something?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> (Doing his best teddy bear impression)</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...May I ask you a question, Euryale?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> All the other traps we&#39;ve seen so far included some sort of hint on how to get past them.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> So why did you not include a hint for this trap?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> You think I need a reason? Don&#39;t get too full of yourself, human.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Those hints were but the merciful whims of a goddess.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I offer hints if and when I feel like it.

Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m in the middle of a call here!?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...Anyway, there&#39;s your answer!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Now I see. So basically, you just goofed up.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> In that case, this will all come down to who can best match Circe beat for beat.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Master is automatically out, of course. We can&#39;t risk putting [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] in any danger.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> So that just leaves us.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Me? Stay in sync with Circe? Queen Witch Circe?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s never happening.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Same goes for me.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Considering that Arjuna and I come from very different times and cultures...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...Odysseus would seem the most sensible choice.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Forget it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Why?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I can&#39;t explain why. I just don&#39;t like it.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> If I teamed up with Odysseus here, it would feel like the gods\u2013er, god, has me dancing right in the palm of her hand!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Well, yeah, in one sense, you definitely would be, but come on, this is no time to be selfish.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I said forget it!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Ugh. Go on, Master, give her a good scolding.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If Circe doesn&#39;t want to, we can&#39;t force her.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> We can&#39;t!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Ghh...

Now that you&#39;ve said that...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...it really does make me feel like I&#39;m just being selfish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So if not Odysseus, who would you be willing to dance with?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well, definitely not Jason or Orion. I mean, talk about being out of the question.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> What was that!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> I don&#39;t have any intention of teaming up with you either, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m out of the question!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I&#39;ve never been so humiliated!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Medea.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong></p><p>Urk.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Lady Artemis.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong></p><p>Urk.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> As for Arjuna and Georgios...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Nnn, something tells me we wouldn&#39;t be able to stay in sync very well...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I am uncertain how much basis that opinion has in fact, but I still agree.</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> So it looks like... Nnn...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You really are the only choice...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I guess...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> So it would seem. But at least neither of us has anything to be embarrassed about at this point.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> After all, we&#39;re already dead.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well, yeah, I know... But it&#39;s still complicated for me, all right!?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> This is what we have to do to make our way through the Labyrinth.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...I&#39;m sure you have your reasons for disliking me...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...but I hope you can put them aside, at least for the moment.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> See!? That, right there! THAT&#39;S what I don&#39;t like about you!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Unfortunately, this seems to just be who I am.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Man, I&#39;m glad I put these limiters on my feelings. We could&#39;ve ended up killing each other here otherwise.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> All right, I&#39;ve had enough. Besides, we&#39;ll never get anywhere if I keep going in circles like this.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Odysseus. You&#39;d better be able to keep up with me.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Make sure you stick close.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> How&#39;s this?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> That&#39;s too close, you idiot! Back off a little.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Okay, here goes. Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> First, we step here.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...I see. We just barely managed to dodge it. It appears the goddess was telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> We&#39;re not done yet. Left! Right! Center!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Duck! Jump! Together and turn!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> They really do work well together. I knew this was the right call.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> NO COMMENTS FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> One, two, three...

How did a lock of my prized blond hair just burn away?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Are you telling me this is an actual death trap!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Why do you think we&#39;re fighting for our lives right now!?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> All that said, it really is a lovely dance.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Okay, you two, let&#39;s see those pearly whites.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Now!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Fine! You want us to smile? We&#39;ll smile! But we&#39;re also gonna duck...now!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> There, we made it! Time to shut this thing down!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> It looks like the lasers are gone. Shall we be on our way then?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Guess it was too much to hope we wouldn&#39;t have to fight another battle, too.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I see the goddess wasn&#39;t exaggerating about her whims. All right then, we&#39;ll just have to end this quickly.</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Hm? Interesting...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Did you just get some more memories back?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I did. All of them, in fact.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Well, with one exception: I still don&#39;t know why I was summoned here.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> But never mind that now.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...Circe. You&#39;re Circe, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> What, you finally remembered who I am?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s me, Circe. The queen witch of Aeaea Island.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I&#39;m glad to finally recognize you again. ...It&#39;s been a long time, hasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well, sorry to burst your nostalgia bubble...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...but I&#39;m not as touched by this impromptu reunion as you are. Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Did you seal your emotions away with magecraft again?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Again?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> You did that a number of times when I was here, too.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Whoa, really? What was I like then?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> You mean you don&#39;t remember?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Uh, no. Not at all.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...To be honest, I don&#39;t know if I can bring myself to tell you.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> And why is that!?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Hahahaha. Forgive me, I was only joking.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ... ...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hey, Odysseus, let me ask you something. What do you think of me?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Good question.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> You are the proud queen witch, and a wise sage knowledgeable in all things.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I only wish you would do something about your habit of turning people into animals.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hmph. I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;m selective about who I turn.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Really!? You are!?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Aah! Master!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> To be perfectly honest, Circe...I&#39;ve always thought you would turn anyone and everyone into pigs.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Indeed, I&#39;ve long had the same impression. Do you actually have some sort of criteria?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Sure I do!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> But I&#39;m not gonna tell you guys what it is.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> That&#39;s all right. I already know what your criteria is.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You do!? How? I didn&#39;t think I ever told anyone.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Well, it&#39;s only a guess on my part, and I could be wrong.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> But regardless, I&#39;ll keep it to myself, since I&#39;m sure you&#39;d prefer it remain a secret.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Hmph.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (So they&#39;ve got their own little secret!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Y-yes, it&#39;s very exciting, isn&#39;t it, Senpai?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Really, criteria or not, I wish you&#39;d juststop turning people into pigs altogether...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Sorry, but I&#39;m not gonna give it up now. Turning people into piglets is kind of my thing.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Why don&#39;t you try being turned into a piglet yourself and see how YOU like it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Another photo, Georgios?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I just had to capture that wonderful expression on your face.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I see. I&#39;ll take that as a compliment.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Now then, let&#39;s go see the goddess who stole my memories and made this Singularity, shall we?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Once we do that, this case will be firmly closed. I think.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Okay. Then let&#39;s get going!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> But first...I&#39;m feeling rather hungry.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> As a Rogue Servant, I apparently don&#39;t have enough magical energy to sustain myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What can we do?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Forming a contract would be the quickest way to remedy it, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I don&#39;t think that would be very wise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Want to form a contract then?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...No, I&#39;d better not.</p><hr><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Minute or not, a goddess is still involved with this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> So you shouldn&#39;t go around forming contracts with Servants unless you&#39;re absolutely sure you can trust them.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Does that mean you don&#39;t even trust yourself?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> That&#39;s right. I don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> In that case, maybe a meal could replenish your magical energy? And I&#39;ve got just the dish in mind!

So this is what she was plotting...</p><hr><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...May I ask why you did this?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Hmm. I guess I can tell you that...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> But first, there&#39;s something else we should do:</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Fight!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I suppose that does keep things simple.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> All right, let&#39;s begin. I am Medea, princess of Colchis, first disciple of Hecate...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...and the devoted witch who has dedicated her life to the pursuit of magic.

Why did you do this?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Okay, I&#39;ll tell you!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oh man, I&#39;ve got a really bad feeling about this...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I did this to help you and Auntie Circe get closer!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry. Could you repeat that?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Sure.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I wanted you and Auntie Circe to get closer!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> S-s-s-say whaaat!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Auntie Circe...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> You might not remember this very well...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...but whenever you get really, reeeally drunk, you just talk nonstop about Odysseus.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Bwuhhh!? (No recollection whatsoever)</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Back when you were alive, there were all sorts of things getting in your way.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Your respective social positions as hero and witch, king and goddess...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> But now that you&#39;re both Servants, you can enjoy your relationship without worrying about any of that, right?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Just like me and Lord Jason!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Huh? (I don&#39;t think we&#39;re especially close now, nor do I really want to be\u2013)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Keep your mouth shut, will you!? This is all complicated enough already!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ... ...I see.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> TH-THAT&#39;S why you went to such ridiculous lengths!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Yep!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> If I hadn&#39;t, I&#39;m certain you&#39;d end up spending your whole materialization at Chaldea moaning about this.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oh man, I seriously don&#39;t remember any of that...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> All that being said, I can&#39;t help but think that stealing my memories was a step too far.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> You&#39;re right, and I do apologize profusely for that.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> But I&#39;m afraid I had no other choice.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> In every scenario I simulated, you two always ended up on the outs whenever you started with all your memories.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> The outs? ...Oh no!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Medea... Please don&#39;t tell me you still have yet to return THOSE memories to him?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I, uh...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> What do you mean? Am I still missing some of my memories?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> But, as long as she&#39;s around...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Medea.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Look. While I do like the very witchy way you took the shortest and most crafty path to your goal...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...this is still something for Odysseus and I to work out on our own. Now give him back the rest of his memories.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Think of it as rewarding him for winning our battle if you have to.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Okay...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Besides, when you get right down to it, that isn&#39;t the part I&#39;m hung up on.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Well then, let me return your memories.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> G-good.

What matters now is that I&#39;m here...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...and I&#39;m going to tell you\u2013 No, show you how I really feel!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I&#39;m taking my emotion limiters off. I&#39;m not gonna hold anything back.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Then show me what you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> The goddess in heaven smiles upon me. The mysterious power of the Titans runs through my veins.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Their vast wisdom is the wind beneath my wings. Now behold as I take flight!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> My name is Circe! I am the queen witch of Okeanos!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Very well, Circe, queen witch of Okeanos. I accept your challenge.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> My name is Odysseus. I am the son and heir of Laertes, and the king of Ithaca.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I am the ever-versatile hero who triumphed over an odyssey of epic proportions!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Now come, and let us have a good, clean fight!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I suppose that&#39;s that then.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> No, it&#39;s okay. You were just worried about us, right?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> There is nothing wrong with that. It&#39;s exactly what a Master is supposed to do.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Besides...it doesn&#39;t matter which of us wins. Isn&#39;t that right, Circe?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Yeah, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Thinking about it now, we should&#39;ve just done this from the start. Er, back when we were still alive, I mean.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> If I&#39;d hit you as hard as I could, cursed your name, and had a no-holds-barred fight like this with you back then...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...I could&#39;ve gotten over you a long time ago, instead of leaving the wound you inflicted on me open forever.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...So.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Now I&#39;m gonna tell you how I really feel, before you disappear.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...All right.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I used to be in love with you.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Even if it was completely unrequited, I loved you all the same!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...But you&#39;ll never feel the same way about me, will you?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...No, I won&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> My heart belongs to Penelope. That hasn&#39;t changed, even now that I&#39;m a Servant.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Would you at least tell me why you love her?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I... I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not because of her beauty, nor her kindness.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I just...love her for who she is.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t explain it better.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I got it. Thanks for being straight with me.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You didn&#39;t do anything wrong, Odysseus. Not a thing.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I guess I kind of gave Medea the wrong idea...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...but my only regret about my time with you was how we parted ways.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> That the very last words we exchanged were angry ones.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> So...I know this is a couple thousand years late, but I want to say it anyway.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He and I stand facing each other. Our only company is the deep red sunset and the sound of the waves.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Odysseus, I hope your life is full of happiness.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> All I want... All I&#39;ve ever wanted... is for you to be happy.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I&#39;m relieved too. I&#39;m glad to see you looking so happy yourself.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> That&#39;s &#39;cause I am.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I&#39;ve got a great Master, great new friends... I&#39;m living the hell out of this second lease on life.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...Hmm. I guess it&#39;s time for me to go.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well, take care. See you at Chaldea someday.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Same to you.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...Oh, and Fujimaru? Look after Circe for me, would you?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> As long as you&#39;re around, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I will. I promise.</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> There he goes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you okay?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oh yeah. Better than okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I hope I wasn&#39;t a third wheel.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Of course not. I&#39;m super grateful you were here, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I&#39;d already made peace with my feelings a long time ago. I just didn&#39;t want to accept that.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> But, I&#39;m okay now.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Sure, he broke my heart...but I got over it! It&#39;s a little painful, but I can deal with it no problem!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hey, Master?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I know I&#39;m just one of dozens of Servants to you...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...but I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re my Master.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Anyway, on a different topic, will you lend me your shoulder for a bit?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> &#39;Cause I&#39;m just gonna break down sobbing for a bit.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Thank you. I mean it. Farewell, my love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so, this insignificant little Singularity disappeared without a trace, carrying my regrets away with it.</p><h2 id="epilogue-you-smile-like-a-flower" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#epilogue-you-smile-like-a-flower" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Epilogue: You Smile Like a Flower</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Some time later.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh, hello, Aun\u2013Lady Circe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Good, you remembered. Excellent work.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Well, you said you were going to curse me if I didn&#39;t, so...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You better believe it!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;m surprised to see you with short hair.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I just felt like a change of pace...or hairdo, anyway.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> It&#39;s not like it made me weaker or anything, so what&#39;s the harm?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Is this because of Odysseus?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hahaha, of course not. I told you, I just felt like it.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well, see you later.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Now that work&#39;s all taken care of, I&#39;ve got a lot of lazing around in Master&#39;s room to catch up on.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Okay, have fun.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oh, and one more thing: don&#39;t go creating any more minute Singularities!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I won&#39;t. Especially not after that earful I got from you and seemingly everyone else in Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve learned my lesson.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Good. Still, that being said... Thanks, Medea!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...You&#39;re welcome!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Oh, Circe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hey, Arjuna. Say, how was the curry you were looking forward to, anyway?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> (Sigh)...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> They actually had curry in the cafeteria just now...but it was the especially mild variety they make for children.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Couldn&#39;t you have tossed in some hot peppers or something?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I plan to, but I&#39;m going to do so in my room just so I don&#39;t get any complaints.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> What about you guys?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Us? We&#39;re taking Arjuna up on his ultraspicy curry challenge.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Heh... He may have the upper hand, but I&#39;m still a Greek hero.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> I certainly can&#39;t afford to lose a duel over something as insignificant as spiciness.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> You said it.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Besides, it&#39;s just spicy food, right? So I figure the worst that could happen is my tongue burns for a while.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Would you care to join us, Circe?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Nah, I&#39;ll pass, thanks.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Besides, I can already tell you two are gonna lose miserably.</p><p><strong>Jason &amp; Orion:</strong> That&#39;s what you think!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Where the hell do you guys get all your confidence from!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hm? Hey, I just realized there&#39;s something different about you. Is it the hair?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Crap. Guess I should&#39;ve known you&#39;d notice, Orion.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I&#39;m guessing by that initial \u201Ccrap\u201D reaction that you don&#39;t mean that as a compliment.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ...Ohhh, I get it! It&#39;s because you had your heart bro\u2013</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Ugh, get with the times already, Jason. What do you think this is, the B.C. era?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> What was that!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well, if you ever feel like joining us in modern times, you could do worse than taking a page from the Red Archer in the cafeteria&#39;s playbook.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;m gonna bounce. Byyye.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> She&#39;s been in a weirdly good mood ever since we took care of that Singularity...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> It kind of feels like she&#39;s more... comfortable with herself now?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I see. In some cultures, people cut their hair after they&#39;ve suffered a broken heart.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> TIL, as they say nowadays.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> You&#39;re still hung up on that!?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Oh, hello, Circe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> What&#39;s up, Georgios? Out taking pictures again?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Yes, I am. ...Say, would you mind if I took one of you?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Me? Sure, if you want.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> All right, here goes...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> So why&#39;d you want my photo all of a sudden?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Good question.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> If I had to give a reason, I suppose I&#39;d say that you looked so sublimely happy...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> It reminded me of a beautiful flower basking in the sunlight.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Aww, thanks. It&#39;s always nice being compared to a flower.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> By the way, I&#39;m exhibiting the photos I took at the last Singularity in the cafeteria if you&#39;d like to see them.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Ooh, nice. I&#39;ll have to check those out.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;d better be on my way.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Oh, but first, there&#39;s something I need to tell you. You-know-who was just summoned here.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oho!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You already showed up, huh? That was faster than I thought.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Circe... Is that you, Circe?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> It sure is! I see you finally got summoned here too, Odysseus.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Indeed. It&#39;s good to see you.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Same. So hey, if you ever have any questions about things here, feel free to ask. I know my way around this place pretty well by now.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Something wrong?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> No. I was just surprised how you seem a little...different now than when you were alive.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> That&#39;s part of being a Servant. We&#39;ve got a second lease on life, so we might as well make the most of it.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...Is that so?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Sure is. Oh, right, I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Since we&#39;re going to be fighting under the same Master from now on, I figure we should at least shake hands.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Good point.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well, see you around!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> Circe!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ...No, never mind. It&#39;s nothing. I look forward to fighting by your side.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> As well you should. I&#39;m not the queen witch for nothing, you know!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong> ... ...A second lease on life, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come in!</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hey there, Piglet!? How are you doing?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> It&#39;s me! Your beloved Servant, Circe the queen witch!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was nice to meet you, my love. Now, it&#39;s time to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I pray.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I pray for his happiness... My happiness... And Master&#39;s happiness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I hope.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I hope that he&#39;ll like it here in Chaldea, and that he&#39;ll find somewhere he belongs.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I wish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I wish that my love, wilted as it may be now, might one day bloom again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> By doing so, I&#39;ve come to love myself as I am, even if only a little.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I do have wings, and so am always ready to take to the sky...</p><p></p>', 1605);
