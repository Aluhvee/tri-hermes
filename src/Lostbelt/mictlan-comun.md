## Prologue

The protagonist trio starts scanning Subject E's room, but it almost immediately begins to collapse when the Alien Priestess appears. Escape sequence with Fujimaru trying to carry the body with them, but ultimately leaving it behind because they wouldn't make it out there. The group safely escapes with the data thanks to Mash being strong enough to carry both of them. Ortenaus is one Slider Mode.

After we ski away from the space hallway, everyone is regrouped in Chaldea, having already put their uniforms out for cleaning. Goredolf praises the trio's accomplishments and comments that he's confident Holmes will return to them soon enough. They're scheduled to rest for 48 hours to enter the South American Lostbelt in top condition.

Sion also drops by and commends us for performing according to calculation. Kadoc quickly caught on that this meant Sion knew that Holmes was an apostle all along. Sion responds by giving her two reasons why she was so sure of it.
1) In Camelot, Holmes synchronized with Trihermes to gain information. Trihermes is the brain and heart of the Atlas Institute. He might have been Sherlock Holmes, but that alone wouldn't make it for him to survive the information overload that comes with this kind of access. He would've had to have been a Divine Spirit or a Servant altered to such capacity.
2) His theories on the Alien God weren't making any progress. He wasn't stuck because he didn't know, he was stuck because knowing was a bad thing. Deceiving himself was the best thing he could have done to keep Chaldea away from getting checkmated. By forgetting he was an apostle, he became an ally of Chaldea.

The only bit Sion is still unclear on is why he consented to become an apostle in the first place. The conclusion here is that the Great Detective Holmes couldn't be trusted, but the ally of Chaldea Holmes could. Kadoc asks about his purpose as an apostle and Sion answers that judging by his actions, it could only have been cooperating with Chaldea. Apostle Holmes and post-amnesia Holmes logically should do the same thing, ergo the Alien God assigned him to the role of helping Chaldea clear the Lostbelts. But then she assigned Moriarty to purge Holmes, so his exact purpose must have been "Help them until point A, then past point B either stop helping or ruin Chaldea from the inside". And so Holmes jumped off the waterfall as his way of choosing Chaldea over the Alien God.

Da Vinci then arrives with the analysis results of data we scanned from the Specimen E room. The data came bundled with a malware bomb containing a farewell video from Young Moriarty. After some more of his "I would have saved the world better than you" spiel from Traum, he starts giving useful exposition on our main aliens.

---

**Moriarty:

[Specimen E] is no lifeform native to Earth. It's the remains of a creature who spent 100 years in that laboratory, concealed, examined, and experimented on. I believe that its death throes called forth its kin, the Alien God, but that's as far as my theory goes. I don't have the numbers I need to solve this equation. Maybe Trismegistus II in the Storm Boarder will be able to reach an answer beyond this. [...] Well, ahem. Let me share one last bonus. After all, if I don't make myself more likable... I mean, if I don't contribute enough to the cause, I'm at risk of Chaldea not wanting to summon me. Let me make this clear: you are very pressed for time. U-Olga Marie, manifested as the Alien God, is plotting to power up her Saint Graph even further. Her current goal is to fuse with the Entity of the Outer Realm slumbering in South America. The absolute taboo that the Mage's Association classifies as exclusive to the Department of Lore. A legitimate space invader on our planet. The alien specimen called ORT. Hahaha, are you surprised? You sure are. Hopefully, your reaction will make my own heartburn pass. We are close to the time limit. There's no time to rest after defeating me. If the Alien God obtains ORT, we Earthlings will have lost. Make all due haste. Unless you want this planet to be split in twain for its potential for evil.

---

Kadoc and Goredolf have different reactions to ORT's name. Kadoc is from a family of nobody mages, so he always assumed ORT was a tall tale mages made up to scare their children into behaving, much like a boogeyman, but Goredolf is nobility so he was raised believing that ORT is real.

---

**Kadoc:**

In terms you'd understand, he's a horror story in the world of magecraft. There was this alien organism that flew down to South America long before the Common Era. Everyone who approaches it are killed instantly. No mage has ever stepped into its territory and came back alive. Nonetheless, be it due to it being considered too dangerous to ignore or just pure academic curiosity, a Grand mage led the long-awaited expedition accompanied by 6 Brand fellowmen in the 16th century. The title of Grand is the peak of what a mage can reach. A Grand is a monster capable of taking down a whole nation on their own. Meanwhile, the Brand mages one rank below them are also precious geniuses with abilities comparable to a Grand. Seven of them together on the same quest is a major event never seen again before or after. There's actually a fair deal of commentary on the festive atmosphere in the exploration camp they made in the jungle. But... only one mage came back from the expedition. His last words were "The creature must still not be touched. No life on the planet is up to the task as of now. Wait for the next geologic period. We'll entrust our hope to the newly evolved life that will come after our extinction." Mid-speech, the man became a living crystal before everyone's eyes. The mage's name was Astea. One of the Clock Tower Lords of his time. After this incident, the person at the top position of the Mage's Association, the headmaster of the Clock Tower, announced that the monster would be named ORT. Since then, one specific region of South America became known as a hellhole humanity should never step foot in.

---

**Goredolf quoting the headmaster of the Clock Tower:**

Only the planet's screams will awaken ORT. It's hibernating all nice and cozy in South America's underground. So you keep your hands off it. The planet will lose its anthroposphere if that thing starts moving.

---

**Mash:**

I remembered. Chaldea's library had a page on ORT. ORT is the toughest and most inexplicable creature the world of magecraft currently knows. This giant spider-shaped alien is known for its hard, soft, hot, and cold skin; its energy production via internal nuclear fusion; and for converting every substance it touches into crystal. A threat to humanity. We can only hope that our technology will be able to analyze him somewhere past the year 3000.

---


Olga fusing with ORT wasn't part of the calculations. She was already level 1000 compared to Chaldea's level 50, so Sion didn't assume she would want to get ORT and climb to level 10000. Urgent change of schedule. Our Excalibur cannon won't work against ORT. The two days of resting are canceled and now we're proceeding to beat Olga before she can achieve her fusion.


::: tip Unrelated Clock Tower notes
ORT survivor Lord Astea is extremely weird to me. The name Astea has been used before as an abbreviation of Meluastea, especially as the title of the Department of Archeology, but in Legacy of the Alchemist more so than ever, it's constantly evidenced that the Department's full name (and therefore its founder's name) is Meluastea. There's a similar precedent with the Department of Hexes being called Zigmarie but often shortened to Zig, but that's a place we know nothing about. Also the Department of Creation being called Valuay while its Lord's name is Valuaylita.

Sanda is probably answering this one still this week while also confirming that the reason why the Meluastea are so important despite being broke is the ORT credits continuing from the 16th century, but until then I'll be assuming that the Meluastea are an Astea branch who took over after ORT left the main line without a heir. Or <ruby>Kadoc<rt>Nasu</rt></ruby> was just lazy and shortened Lord Meluastea's name, who knows.

## Chapter 1: To the Land Of The Dead 

Fujimaru debuts Habetrot's new Anti-Alien God Master Mystic Code. The scheduled 2 days of rest were reduced to 2 hours + tea with honey. Mash's Ortinax was also in top condition since it was barely damaged in Traum. That said, da Vinci forbids Mash from weaponizing the concept of death with the Black Barrel. It puts too much strain on Mash's body and threatens Fujimaru's future survival. The compressed mana cannon function is still authorized to use, but not in populated areas since that would harm innocent civilians. Da Vinci also comments on Mash's power-up. Servants don't evolve beyond the abilities of their lifetime because they don't have a body to develop. Their physical form is still ether instead of flesh. But Mash is a Saint Graph transplanted into a human body, so her mental changes trigger physical growth that evolves her Saint Graph accordingly. The drawback here is that if she gets even more powerful, she'll quickly stop being Demi. Da Vinci reminds her that if things get really bad, she can just take off her Ortinax. Chaldea has other options.

We approach the South American Lostbelt. Da Vinci announces that the simulations proved our Holy Sword cannon 99.99% reliable. She named the thing <ruby>Hume-Barrel<rt>Human Order theorem</rt></ruby> <ruby>Rayproof<rt>Proof of a future</rt></ruby>. Sion also has her report on Subject E. She confirms it was a state-of-the-art operating room within our level of civilization, that there's no lifeform like it in Trismegistus's records, and that blood traces conspicuously distant from the surgery table indicate a murder occurred in that room. Further analysis was discontinued to prioritize clearing the Lostbelt.

Our plan is to enter the Lostbelt with a group of 4 Servants. Out of them, Nitocris, is already summoned and present in the briefing room, but the other 3 will be summoned later. Since she was summoned from Chaldea's suitcase, Nitocris has her Camelot memories. Nito on her own is already adaptable, capable of crowd combat, and has magecraft strong against fever and defilement, but for this mission, she also leveled to her ideal form (3rd Ascension) and added Independent Action functions so she can keep guarding the team even in case Fujimaru dies.

---

**Habetrot:**

Heya! I'm Habetrot! I'm basically a guardian fairy living in Mash's shield!

**Nitocris:** 

How courteous of you. I take it you are in god Bastet's service? Pleased to meet you.

---

Sion reminds everyone the Fantasy Tree wasn't detected. It could be either dried up like in Britain or hidden like in China, but since the Lostbelt is up, it's guaranteed something is performing the Fantasy Tree function there. Regardless, ignore that for now because the first priority is stopping Olga from reaching ORT. The Storm Boarder enters the Lostbelt's walls.

---

We get our first visuals of the Lostbelt and there Pangea has been turned into a total wasteland. Fou signals us to a fast-approaching object. U-Olga detected us entering her exchange student home and warped to where we were. She could pulverize the Storm Border instantly with her usual gravity manipulation but she's currently feeling great because she's just back from killing all 7 Grand Servants offscreen, so she'll humor us with a hand-to-hand brawl. For Chaldea, the plan is to knock her off the deck with our Servants then shoot the Hume-Barrel on her point-blank.


[<- Battle against U-Olga Marie ->]

---

As usual, Olga is completely unharmed, and she learns the Skills used against her. Having seen enough, she does her gravity field, which she names "Haste Makes Waste". Mash manages to bounce the attack back with Mold Camelot.

---

**U-Olga Marie:**

Agh- you just hit it back like a ball!? This is...tennis! Yes, tennis, I saw it in the records! So you were a Heroic Spirit of tennis!

---

With this having bought us enough time, we hit Olga with the Hume-Barrel. Much like the Black Barrel weaponizes the concept of death by converting the enemy's own lifespan into the energy that kills it, the Hume-Barrel Rayproof weaponizes the legitimacy of Pan-Human History by converting the enemy's level of threat to humanity. Olga's horns absorbed the whole blast, but that's something we predicted she could do. The blast should still work. But it didn't. Olga is very upset by this result because she knows that whatever weakened the shot was not anything she did. She's just as clueless as us about what caused her survival.

Immediately after, the earth's crust crumbles and the Lostbelt's underground sun takes the form of a giant woman to attack Olga. She's caught off-guard as she never saw the sun do this in her previous visits to the underground world. Nemo decides to abandon ship and commands everyone to evacuate to the Shadow Boarder. The Nemos will be the last to leave their posts on the Storm Boarder, but he spared one Marine to accompany the evacuees. The new enemy is a fusion of plant and mineral. A plant sun with mineral flames. It fights and overpowers Olga while we evacuate. Its slap also destroys a Storm Boarder wall, causing Fujimaru to fall to their death. The ship is plummeting, but before the crash landing, Nemo uses the ship's remaining energy to summon the team's other 3 Servants.


::: tip Opinions
Hume-Barrel Rayproof is the dumbest name Nasu ever invented, he should be ashamed of it, and I hope it never comes up again.
:::

## Chapter 2: Golden Rainforest

In the foggy afterlife, a man (who in a later chapter will be revealed to be Tezcatlipoca) invites Fujimaru to sit with him by the bonfire. He doesn't name himself nor ask for Fujimaru's name, as names aren't necessary for those who have concluded their battles. The man then discusses the Storm Boarder.

---

**Man:**

Not too shabby for a weapon. Is that thing yours? I like modern weapons. They're cumbersome, tasteless, and above all else, costly. I, for one, welcome 'em. After all, tools of war should evolve. Just as life does. 

---

But his positive impression of their weapons absolutely doesn't translate into a positive impression of the wielder. He thinks their idea of a battle without fair casualties on both sides is a sick joke. He says Fujimaru only went this far without casualties because they were lucky and that now, this luck has ran out, as no human in the Storm Boarder will survive the ship dropping from above the surface (above the Silent Ilhuicatl, as he calls it).

---

**Man:**

There are no warriors on it. They won't make it here after death either. ...Hmm? Hold on a second, does that mean I've acknowledged you as a warrior? ...I can never tell what Blue's thinking. Oh well, I suppose it's just the usual fluke. 

---
Hearing no one will survive, Fujimaru gets restless to go to the Storm Boarder, but the man warns them they can't reach the world of the living. Fujimaru wants to try anyway, which further displeases the man, but he's willing to guide them there in exchange for weapons. As his choice of outfit tells, he's a big fan of the modern era, so he's super willing to bring Fujimaru back to life for some 21st-century guns. Unfortunately, the only weapons Fujimaru has to offer are their 3 Command Spells. He takes it, and since the payment was worth more than Fujimaru's life, the man not only drops them back into the world of the living but also gives them a pack of calaveras de azúcar as a bonus.

Fujimaru wakes up alone with the panicking Nemo Marine who was accompanying him in the evacuation. Marine is speaking all quietly and urging Fujimaru to get out of the cave because Olga is also unconscious next to them, but Fujimaru's louder reaction wakes her up. As an outer space aristocrat, she's disappointed she's not being welcomed with applause, but seeing they did nothing to her during her suspended animation, she concludes that Fujimaru and Nemo are primitive but harmless. The amnesiac future ruler of the planet introduces herself to her two new friends and explains her memory circumstances. All she can remember is her name and her purpose. Fujimaru and Marine tell her their names, but not their purpose. Soon enough, Marine's "PLEASE DON'T KILL ME" is enough for Olga to deduce that their purpose is prolonging their lives. For reasons she doesn't understand, the name Fujimaru Ritsuka makes her want to deck their face. Still, in respect for this first contact, she names her two friends Interstellar Goodwill Ambassadors.

Sensing distress in her friends' brain waves, Olga promises to help them find a way out of the cave. As someone who is here to rule the planet, she can't ignore the pleas of a sapient being in need. With the President's help, we make it to the South American jungles.

---

Shortly after leaving the cave, Olga detects aggressive brain waves: gun-toting men wearing jaguar masks. Fujimaru tries summoning Servants, only to remember they're without Command Spells.


[[<- Olga solo battle against the new enemy ->]]

---

Olga quickly overpower the jaguar people, claiming it was easy as fixing a typo on a report. A recurring thing so far is that most metaphors Olga uses are related to undergrad student life. The Marine wants to get out before more enemies appear. Olga points out it doesn't matter how many there are if the hostile organisms are that weak, but immediately comes to understand their concerns once she remembers her friends are organisms that take damage from physical impact.

---

**U-Olga Marie:**

Why would the animals of this planet evolve in such a way? There's no practical advantage to this.

---

The Marine takes the scout role in our new group. Olga is puzzled by the idea that he would want to have a contributing role instead of quietly hiding behind her. The thought of not letting the strongest do everything feels silly to her. She then asks about Fujimaru. They didn't join the fight, but the way they hid behind a tree to assess the situation shows Olga that they're experienced in combat despite their young age and fragile vessel.

The Marine finds potentially edible vegetables and calls the two to see them. He catches Olga off-guard by grabbing her hand. She's really confused about his brain waves. At first, they were completely red (fear and caution) but now they're suddenly blue (conversational). Fujimaru's, on the other hand, were always yellow (joy and friendship). That's because he learned during the battle that Olga is scary, but she isn't threatening. The President got her first Earthling supporter. We notice the enemies returning for a second round and the Marine suggests Olga try talking to them this time to garner more supporters.

---

**U-Olga Marie:**

Heh heh. It seems like you're starting to understand me now, kid! Yes, I did not come to Earth to exterminate all of its primitive life! I got much better things to do! I've heard screams on this planet, and so I have arrived to improve its management! A dialogue must come first, no matter how ferocious or barbarous the other party is.

---

However, the enemies appearing this time are dinosaurs, so Olga panics and immediately resorts to violence.


[[<- Olga solo battle against dinosaurs ->]]

Turns out Olga is too afraid of reptiles to handle this battle, so she panickedly asks for a retreat or for Fujimaru to do something about them with their trump card. Unfortunately, Fujimaru doesn't have the Command Spells to summon Servants. The Chaldean rescues the team, commenting on how pitiful it is that humanity's last Master can't handle a pack of irrational deinos. Marine and Olga ask who is he and Fujimaru answers he's someone going by Romani Archaman's name.

---

The Chaldean confirms himself as someone going by Romani Archaman's name, and thus the name in his textboxes changes to Romani Archaman. It's not a name that represents his identity, but as humans say: "It's what's inside that counts". He posits that since Fujimaru knows the person wearing that skin is someone else, it doesn't matter what name he goes by. Fujimaru argues that it matters, they want the name to refer to someone who deserves it, but "Romani" agrees to disagree. Romani notices no serious injuries on Fujimaru or bugs in their Mystic Code, so he asks if it was psychological trauma that made them not able to summon Servants. Fujimaru tries to hide their hand, making it visible to Romani that it has no Command Spell markings (not that the CS are used up, the whole image is gone from the hand). He warns Fujimaru they'll never summon a Servant again and need a new survival strategy. He tries to leave, as he has no business with Fujimaru now that they're no longer a Master, but Fujimaru asks to see Mash. He tells them Mash is on the horn-shaped rock to the south. Like our Nemo Marine, she also jumped off the Storm Boarder to save Fujimaru.

---

**Romani Archaman:**

One more thing... It's quite awkward that I have to say this, but... If mankind can excise all seven Lostbelts, then I will finally acknowledge you as my enemy ...though I expect that won't be the case. You're up against Daybit Sem Void. Defeating ORT is impossible for you lot.

---

After our Dr. Roman lookalike leaves, the Marine comments on the awkwardness of the encounter and notices how U was all frozen up during his scene. She says she has no opinion. Though she asks if Romani was a living being since he had no brain waves and completely ignored her. That aside, Team Chaldea moves in the pointed direction to reassemble with Mash.

---

We get to the cave where we're supposed to meet Mash. The Marine speculates the enemies we just faced are the Lostbelt King's underlings. Having heard the name Chaldea dropped a few times during the conversation, Olga finally asks who is this Chaldea. Fujimaru will explain later.

We enter the cave and it's fairly well-furnitured. A voice coming from the wall asks them if they're the Chaldea people Mr. Romani mentioned. The voice apologizes for the rudeness and turns off his camouflage, revealing himself to be a gentleman dinosaur. He's a retired deinos named Tepeu. The deinos are this Lostbelt's dinosaurian mankind. Our Marine is terrified of being eaten but Tepeu explains the deinos are a herbivore species, and capable of photosynthesis. He offers us water since the Mictlan has been really hot these days.

Mash and Habetrot come back from the chores they were doing in Tepeu's house. Seeing Mash, Olga cordially introduces herself to this Chaldea person she's been hearing so much about. The scene cuts to after Mash calms down and hears the whole story. She apologizes for her shameful initial reaction. Habetrot tries to say anyone would react like that after seeing the Alien God, but Mash closes her mouth before she can say the problem word. Next, we ask Tepeu about the Lostbelt. He already knows about the Lostbelt situation from a previous visitor and his opinion is that the Chaldeans are guests rather than enemies. Friends who have a duty here. He believes the deinos won't mind Chaldea destroying their world because all worlds perish; that's normal. Who cares about what the cause is? Tepeu would resist if his death would cause the death of the world, but thankfully, it's the other way around. It's Chaldea who is in a situation where they can't die or else their world dies, so Tepeu is wholeheartedly cheering for humanity's cause.

---

**U-Olga Marie:** 

How can you have a conversation when your frequency is completely different?

**Tepeu:** 

That is the work of Maia...an alteration in cognition applied by this very world. Earlier, a new culture came to our world. This Crypter fellow. Maia analyzed his language and cognitive standards, then tuned itself so that mutual dialogue became possible. I suppose you could think of this as a universal translator cast on the entire world.

**Marine:** 

I see. Come to think of it, your vocal cords are completely different from ours, Tepeu. So who is this Maia? They sound pretty amazing...

**Tepeu:** 

Maia is not a person. It is more of a... life essence. Collective goodwill, as it's called in your world. The sentiment to make the world a better place to live. The source and guiding principle of everything that makes up this underground world, Mictlan. 

---

Like Agartha, Mictlan is another world within the Hollow Earth, but while Agartha was just a flat horizontal continent, Mictlan is a 1000-kilometers tall cylindrical world with its own gravity, water, and atmosphere. It's divided into 9 levels. By the way, the name Mictlan is very recent. It was coined by Izcalli, the leader of the Ocelomeh.

The word Ocelotl (plural Ocelomeh, Nahuatl grammar is weird) refers to the Aztec jaguar warriors so we deduced he means the people with guns we fought before getting here. Tepeu explains that the Ocelomeh are a tribe that arrived together with Crypter. They built a city in the 5th level, established a mafia organization, and started hunting deinos. Many were killed and many were turned into irrational beasts.

---

**Marine:** 

What a savage bunch... But why are they doing this? Are you fighting over territory here in Mictlan?

**Tepeu:** 

It's not so much about territory as it is about resources. They're after revenue. They strip off our hides, process our bones, and distribute our hearts as treasure. Maia disapproves of such behavior, but they are a cunning bunch who can escape the eyes of its law. Systematic violence organized as a distributor of goods. That's what the Ocelomeh are.

**Marine:** 

That's just a mafia! Is the jungle really so scary!? 

---

Hearing about the dinosaur world mafia, Fujimaru gets worried about the people on the Boarder. Mash explains their last contact was 4 hours ago. Sion told her it would take days to finish repairing the ship. The Boarder is 300km away so it's going to take days to cross the jungle; there's no time to waste. Mash and Habetrot thought it was too dangerous for the two of them to be alone, but they're confident they can do it with Fujimaru there to summon Servants and fuel the Black Barrel. Fujimaru breaks the bad news to them, but the group decides to go anyway because they have Olga. Tepeu gives them directions. He saw our "flying rock" falling close to Chichén Itzá. Getting there requires crossing Tlathuic and that's not advisable for beginners, so Tepeu puts on his glasses and coat because he will be personally guiding us.

---

2 hours of walking later... it's goddamn hot outside Tepeu's cave. 58 Celsius because the sun is on the second level. He suggests taking a break until the sun goes away. The Marine and Habetrot go fetch water, which segues into some commentary about wanting to be useful despite not being able to fight.

The jungle is so densely packed with information that Olga has to turn off her sensors until she's habituated to the environment. Trying to use them caused her to throw up her rainbow-colored vomit. She asks how come Mash and Fujimaru are from the same humanity when Mash's physical structure is so different from theirs. She tells her she's a Demi-Servant, but doesn't get to explain because Olga is very insistent that she knows what it is. She totally studied Earth's main export products.

Marine and Habetrot come back being chased by aggressive deinos. Tepeu explains their brains have deteriorated, reducing them to mindless carnivores. Dialogue is impossible, you either run or stop them. However, Olga is now able to fight the dinosaurs because she has Mash as her tank, keeping them away from her.


[ <- Mash/Habetrot/Olga-only battle against jungle snakes an irrational deinos -> ]

Out of the jungle, we reach a field of 2-meter-tall corn stalks. Corn is the most popular food among deinos, the only one they eat for flavor rather than nutrition. The Marine mentions the use of corn for ethanol, leaving Tepeu and Olga astonished by the idea of using a source of nutrients as fuel. Why would you prioritize fuel over Earth's natural cycles? Mash explains biofuel agriculture and greenhouse gas emission, leaving Olga all the more convinced her strong leadership is necessary to get humanity out of its losing streak.

Habetrot points out it looked like noon when we left 6 hours ago and now it still looks like noon. The sun isn't moving west to set. Olga confirms the sun in Mictlan has only been moving vertically. Deeper into the underground world with each hour. We're clearly in dire need of a huge exposition dump, so we ask Tepeu about multiple topics that can be reordered or skipped by the player's choices.

1. Mictlan's structure

::: tip
Mictlan may be a flat jungle but it's divided into 9 levels.
1. Tlalocan, where a precipice serves at the ceiling leading to the surface.
2. Tlatlauhqui, the red underworld border. The endless river where the giant iguana lives.
3. Chichen Itza, City of Gold, and the fertile plains.
4. Iztauhqui, the white underworld border. The valley of blades and winds where bones are discarded.
5. Tula, the veins of the land. The lake of birds and blood.
6. Xoxoauhqui, the blue underworld border. The galactic dunes, the vacuum lightning garden.
7. Astronomical Observatory Metztitlán, the Singing Ilhuicatl.
8. Yayauhqui, the black underworld border. The sunless underground mountain range.
9. Fear Grounds Xibalba, the place where the Ceiba tree is rooted.

All levels are connected by land, so any deinos can just walk through them, but the 4 border levels are dangerous zones where the dead can attack you at any moment. Going lower than 7 is particularly dangerous because the fog in the 8th and 9th levels brings death to the living. The fog only clears up once every 360th sunset, and from there it takes 5 days for it to restart. Some deinos go to the lower levels during these 5 days, but no one ever succeeded in the underworld pilgrimage. Going from 1 to 3 takes 4 days, but having to cross 2 is a harsh obstacle.
:::

2. The sun's mechanism

::: tip
Aside from what Olga already explained above, the other point of interest about the Mictlan sun is that it's a god named Kukulkan. Mictlan mythology has nothing to do with Aztec mythology, despite the shared names. The sun was just a thing the deinos took for granted like they did everything else, but when Daybit arrived in Mictlan, the concept of gods was introduced to the world via Tezcatlipoca. With gods now being a thing in deinos culture, the sun came to be seen as something special, and thus deified into Kukulkan. Daybit's arrival also popularized the previously underutilized concept of verbal conversation, which created the concept of stories, which enabled Kukulkan's apotheosis. Mictlan and Kukulkan get their names taken from Aztec mythology precisely because they are recent names imported from Daybit.
:::

3. Deinos biological history

::: tip
At the origin of Mictlan, the ancestor species to the deinos (the Pan-Human theropods) evolved into the prime species in charge of managing that world. Maia has some level of control over their birth, making it so the rare plesiosaur and pterosaur-type deinos always exist, but ensuring the theropod-type is the vast majority. Plesiosaur and pterosaur deinos are discriminated social outcasts. While most dinosaurs were carnivores, there are no carnivore deinos. The toxins of meat make deinos agonize, lose their intellect, and eventually die. That's how the Ocelomeh has been creating the mindless deinos that have been attacking us throughout this chapter. 
:::

4. Cities and culture

::: tip
This is one initially sidetracked by us mentioning oceans and having to explain what they are to Tepeu. We spend a long time teaching him about Pan-Human political and scientific concepts such as democracy, communism, genes, cells, atoms, and chemical elements. Also culinary. It's kinda amazing how fast Tepeu is learning all this, so they ask if he isolated himself in the 1st level because his genius intellect ostracized him from other deinos. He explains that it's not that he's smarter, it's that the other deinos don't see any need for knowledge. Humans are short-lived, easily injured, and lacking in survivability, so their thirst for knowledge is a physical survival need. This is not true for deinos. There was no threat that necessitated this kind of evolution in Mictlan.

The two main cities of Mictlan are:

1. Chichen Itza, the golden city in level 3. The city of the deinos. It's where the Dinosaur King reigns under the protection of Kukulkan, the sun god.
2. Mexico City, in level 5. The city of the Ocelomeh. It's a city of death created by Daybit and Tezcatlipoca.

The Storm Boarder's estimated landing point is between these two cities.

5. Crypter

"Crypter" is known as the man who brought Tezcatlipoca to this world, and Tezcatlipoca is the god of war and sacrifice that brought the border levels to their current hellish form.

Tezcatlipoca's Ocelomeh are humans who have been turning deinos mindless for the teaching of their new religions. Their faith tells them to sacrifice powerful hearts to their god and the strongest creatures around in Mictlan are the deinos. They built a city in the 5th level and are gouging out the hearts of deinos. Now the deinos are at war against the Ocelomeh.

::: tip
Deinos are capable of photosynthesis but they felt the need for a luxury treat to spice up their lives, so that's where Maia created corn, the ultimate food, and blessing of the sun.

Tepeu went to sleep early because he has a lot of new information to digest. Olga is watching the stars 20 meters away from the group, so Fujimaru and Mash take this chance to discuss what to do about her. Fujimaru suggests we continue not telling her she's the Alien God. Mash, Marine, and Habetrot agree, although acknowledge how manipulative this is. Habetrot imposes one condition: This need to be the only secret we keep from her. True friends don't hide everything from each other.

Mash and Fujimaru then interrupt Olga's presidential duty of assigning names to the constellations and tell her about Servants, Masters, mages, Chaldea, the Incineration, Singularities, the bleaching, Crypters, Fantasy Trees, PHH, Lostbelts, and Earth's many crises. Olga is impressed with their noble job of restoring humanity's future and expresses her pride in us with a 9 out of 10 rating, the highest grade she's ever given. It's not 10 because it's missing one finishing touch to perfect it. Fujimaru invites Olga to be this missing piece that completes the team.

---

**U-Olga Marie:**

Heh! This answer alone dropped humanity's foolishness score to 0! After hearing this, I'm obliged to help you save Earth. Count on me fighting by your side, friends!

---

It's been a great talk, but it's late and they need to sleep. The sun has 12 hours until the sun appears where they are, so they want to sleep 7 hours and leave the corn fields before that happens.

Meanwhile, a man in priestly garb is watching the situation, unsure of what to do about it.

## Chapter 3: Tlatlauhqui, The First Underworld Border

The chapter starts with the party getting to the first underworld border. Since Tezcatlipoca's arrival, the underworld borders have been turned into hellish trial grounds for the dead, but these trial grounds have one interesting arrangement: if you know in your heart that you already overcame the trial, you are completely safe to come and go. Tepeu already cleared up to the 3rd underworld border, so he'll be safe here. Last chapter, he described this border as a river with a giant iguana, and since we learned that Mictlan names are taken from Daybit's knowledge of Aztec and Mayan mythology, Mash asks if the Lostbelt iguana is also named Xochitónal. Tepeu confirms after a Mash infodump about the Pan-Human Mictlan.

Olga asks why the deinos live underground. Tepeu relates that a meteor impact in the distant past that made the surface uninhabitable, so the dinosaurian mankind escaped to this underground space created by Maia. Now tens of thousands of years later, the surface is still burning. Olga is shocked at how lazy the planet is being about its recovery.

Olga asks if anyone knows what ORT is since it's one of the few terms she still remembers. Fujimaru and Mash tell know the rumors and that they came to the Lostbelt to find ORT, but that stopped being a priority. Olga thinks they mean rescuing the Boarder is the new priority, so she agrees that going after ORT is a waste of time.

We get to the river of the Red Underworld Border trial, but it's gotten so wide that it looks more like an ocean with waterfalls than a river. Tepeu freaks out when he sees the river because it's immensely bigger than it was when he last came to Tlatlauhqui. His heart doesn't believe he cleared this trial, so he's as in danger as any of us now. The giant iguana from the trial appears.


[ <- Mash/Olga solo battle against Xochitónal and smaller underworld iguanas -> ]

---

We beat Xochitónal. Olga getting used to the giant lizards. We didn't even need Habetrot to win the fight, which is great because Habetrot's energy can only be recharged at the Boarder. Anyways, the next part of the trial is crossing the river. Tepeu can't swim so that's out of the question. He made a raft to clear it the first time, but the river is too big for that now. Fujimaru is no longer a Master so we can't just randomly summon Noah, Moses, Icarus, or Sindbad to take us to the other side with their NPs. Olga points out that all these namedropped options wouldn't work because it's an underworld river, so we should take a hero familiar with the underworld.

Kingprotea overhears us talking about Chaldea and assumes we are the enemy that knocked down the Storm Boarder.


[ <- Mash/Habetrot solo battle against Xochitónal and smaller underworld iguanas -> ]

The battle stops because Protea saw Fujimaru, which is the only person she recognizes because Mash wasn't in the SE.RA.PH. event. Luckily, one of Protea's components is Airavata. Swimming in the ocean of milk is essentially crossing an ocean of death and Protea is big enough to carry everyone to the other side, so we found out the solution to the trial.

---

Protea is doing great, swimming fast up the river and jumping all the waterfalls. Olga is the only one who isn't riding Protea, instead setting Protea as the gravity field she's hovering above because she's weirded out by Tiamat's horns. As we approach the other shore, we notice Protea is bleeding a lot. She does her best and holds over until she can safely place us on dry land.

Camazotz (the Camazotz from Pan-Human Aztec and Mayan mythologies, not any Lostbelt version) introduces himself with bombastic gloating about how he'll bring death to the traitor Kingprotea because she's opening the way when she's supposed to be an obstacle. He tries to suck Protea's blood and learns that Servant blood tastes awful. He quickly takes his leave, announcing we'll be seeing each other a lot. He claims he could behead Fujimaru and taste their blood right now, but he won't because he wants to get more entertainment out of watching Fujimaru's rivalry with their enemy Daybit Sem Void.

Camazotz's last act before disappearing is using one of Fujimaru's Command Spells to force Kingprotea into Xochitónal's position of guardian of this underworld border. Not only that, but he took the Xochitónal we defeated and turned it into a green calavera mask he attached to Kingprotea.


[ <- Mash/Habetrot/Olga solo battle against Kingprotea Xochitónal -> ]

Protea is tanking Black Barrel shots and all the attacks Olga can throw in her current weakened state, so the group decides to hide in the jungle and hope she doesn't crush us. Tepeu explains that since she was made into the guardian of the underworld, she can't pursue us out of the river. We just need to be lucky enough to escape her reach before she squishes us.

---

**U-Olga Marie:**

Then it's child's play! As a matter of fact, my luck is galactic-tier! Show me a 99% win rate raffle, and I'm certain to get the 1% loss! Hwahahaha!

---

Case in point, Kingprotea Xochitónal squishes Olga. The totally flattened and buried Olga simply springs back unharmed like a Tom & Jerry character because she's the invincible President of Earth.

We see the river going all red from Protea's bleeding and get worried about her. We can't nab Camazotz to bring her back to normal because he already flew far beyond our reach. With combat having just proven to not be an option, the only alternative we're left with is waiting for Kingprotea to bleed out. No one likes that, so Rasputin asks if he can offer his suggestion.



---

Rasputin explains he's not here to antagonize us, he was simply looking for his lady to escort her back to her Earth supervision office (named Great Majestic House). Olga can't remember Rasputin but he explains he's her loyal butler and she figures it's only obvious she'd have one of those. Besides, her brain wave sensor can tell he's not lying. Rasputin wishes she would remember her position and cut ties with Chaldea, but since she won't, he has no choice but to accompany his lady in her decisions. Kirei joined our party, but since he claims to be a powerless priest, we don't get to use him in battles.

Kirei's first question as a teammate is repeating Muramasa's "what was Limbo's last moments like?" question almost word-for-word, then repeating the same "Pretend I never asked" reaction. Back to more relevant matters, Kotomine speaks out of his familiarity with exorcism to tell that Protea's calavera mask is an evil spirit possessing her. Removing the mask can return her sanity, although it can't relieve her of her guardian of the underworld status. She won't be able to leave her underworld border and accompany us on the "living" sections of Mictlan.

Rasputin brings up another huge exploit that can be done in the underworld borders. Since it's Pan-Human underworld concepts superimposed on a Lostbelt, it falls under both compiled events and pruned events. Exclusively in this area, Fujimaru can summon Servants from all possible and/or impossible pasts, presents, and futures. With the right Servants, we can capture Kingprotea Xochitónal, he reasons. We tell Rasputin that Fujimaru's Command Spells are now Camazotz's Command Spells. Knowing that Camazotz had Command Spells, Camazotz's ability to make Servants go Alter finally makes sense to Kirei.

And here is where Rasputin brings up the next big underworld border exploit. Fujimaru's contract trades their Master status for their return to the world of the living. But the underworld borders aren't the world of the living, so in these areas only, the contract is not valid. Fujimaru can tackle all the trials with gameplay summons. The plan is to immobilize Kingprotea with our playable Servants and then Kotomine can do his classic spirit surgery to remove the death mask's tumor. That's not a thing he can do on account of being Rasputin, but rather because his other components include "the temptation of immortality" and Kotomine Kirei.

---

Our gameplay team is positioned to fight Kingprotea Xochitónal. Mash is positioned to throw Kotomine at the mask once she's in check.


[ <-Battle against Kingprotea Xochitónal-> ]

::: tip Gameplay gimmicks
Kingprotea Alter’s battle gimmick is that you can stop her big heal by fielding a goddess, can stop her party shuffle by fielding a defender, and can stop her heal-per-turn by fielding an obstacle-maker.
:::

Mash tosses the priest. Spirit surgery time.

---

**Rasputin:**

Agony. Suffering. On the name of the evil dragon signifying death, I look upon a wellspring of pus. The defilement of death and fevers from ague call upon us all. I will scoop out the mud that splashes into a flood.

<ruby>Помилуй нас, Господи.<rt>Have mercy on my soul</rt></ruby>


---

The mask came off and kept fighting, but now that Protea's body is no longer at risk, we can go all out on it.


[ <-Battle against the calavera mask-> ]

When the mask dies, it returns to being one Command Spell and goes to Fujimaru's hand. But this alone doesn't return Fujimaru's full Master rights. They're still limited to only 2 gameplay Servants when outside of the underworld borders.

Despite this, Kingprotea is not immediately back to normal. She yells some about how it's unforgivably humiliating for a human to defeat a giant and that the conceited summoner must pay for how they disgrace the descendants of myths, but she also acknowledges that this was an attempt to save the non-Alter Kingprotea, so as much as she wishes she wouldn't have to, she reverts back to her regular form. In her last words, she demands that when Fujimaru inevitably summons Kingprotea Alter, it isn't for something stupid.



::: tip Opinions
This last beat pretty much confirms that Kingprotea Alter will be made summonable on the stupidest event imaginable. Place your bets. I'm going with kaiju event.
:::

## Chapter 4: In The Golden City 

We leave Kingprotea behind in Tlatlauhqui and reach the tropical 3rd level. Banter about Marine and Tepeu's father-son dynamic reveals that Tepeu's age is equivalent to a 90-year-old in human years, but there's no problem in bringing such an elder on our journey because deinos bodily functions don't deteriorate with age.

We also get a flashback to our goodbye with Protea at the underworld border. It establishes that Camazotz contacted Storm Boarder Servants in advance to force them to accept the role of guardian. There's only so much they can do without a Master, so they have to take the offer to stay anchored. Kirei also explains that spirit surgery can't relieve her of duty, so the only way to take Kingprotea out of the underworld border is to reset her: dismiss this one and summon a new Kingprotea at the Storm Boarder. We'll see if we can find an alternative solution after regrouping at the Boarder. Kingprotea promised to fight for us with all she can if we ever choose to return to her border.

Once all the Protea-related dialogue is settled, we're randomly attacked by carnivorous insects that inflict fever on contact. The bugs' neurotoxins make deinos pass out and/or kill themselves from excessive pain, making them the #6 leading cause of death for deinos. This Lostbelt is a world where even the weakest creatures have a way to prey on the strong.


[ <-Battle against flesh-eating bugs-> ]

We were jumped on really out of nowhere because our recon Marine didn't think to keep watch at the sky and the Ortinax radar didn't register the bugs as threats. It won't happen again now that we know. We can also sleep safely knowing that the Ortinax is producing an insect-repelling frequency.

---

**Tepeu:** 

Driving insects off with repulsive noise... Countermeasures utilizing instinct. Marvelous. So this is how the humanity of Pan-Human History fills the blanks in their world piece by piece.

**U-Olga Marie:** 

Hmph. Filling in blanks that should stay untouched makes them a perfect illustration of how actions have consequences. Nuclear fission is the best example of this. For energy, they discharge substances hazardous to their kind. There's something off with humanity's technological development roadmap. No respectable sapient would engage in tests with fission without first establishing a means to dispose of hazardous material. And yet the humans of Pan-Human History always chase after the 'maximum benefit'. 

---

That said, our president is expecting a breakthrough in clean energy. In the next 100 years, we'll have stable nuclear fusion and finally become a humanity worthy of her rule. Mash and Fujimaru ask Olga why she wants to be president and she answers that on her empty planet, she heard Earth's screams calling her. She can't remember the reason why or her exact plan, but she wanted to be a leader that would guide and cultivate the world, ensuring a future with equal governance, impartial history, and where all races and ideologies can accept each other. In a moment of instability, she mutters something about returning to a blank slate and restarting with a less intelligent humanity, but she doesn't know what that was about. She starts to get her LB5 memories mixed with her LB7 memories and wraps up the conversation with her old "I have come to right this planet's wrongs and eradicate its evil once and for all" Olympus quote.

Fujimaru asks why she cares so much if she thinks humanity is so foolish. She assures them that being foolish is not necessarily a bad thing, nor exclusive to humanity. Every sapient life is foolish and it's their mistakes that renew the universe. In her inner thoughts, Olga complains about how this president can't even do a secretary's job with her body still at 4% capacity. That's when she realizes she doesn't really know what she is.

---

We're out of the woods, arriving at a great plain. We're immediately attacked by a pack of deinos under the Dinosaur King's order to let no Ocelotl pass.


[ <-Battle against fighter deinos-> ]

The enemies get really excited at all these Ocelotl weapons they've never seen before. There's no way to hide from them in the big plains, their numbers are too big to fight, and it's impossible to talk with them because deinos grow unreasonably stubborn when they are assigned a task. We also learn here that pain is pleasurable stimuli for deinos and that it can easily get addictive. Tepeu recommends we fall back into the jungle. We then take the route to Chichen Itza, so we can ask the Dinosaur King to let us through.

---

Chichen Itza is a deinos city, so everything is massive to accommodate the size of its citizen. Habetrot has to stay inside the Ortinax because each step on a staircase is too tall for her to climb. To ensure we won't be mistaken for Ocelomeh again, Mash, Fujimaru, and Kotomine are disguised as deinos with Kotomine's ~~magecraft~~ sacraments. Marine and Olga stayed behind because Olga refuses to look like a lizard and Marine doesn't want her to be alone. It shouldn't be too long because we're just here to ask for passage to the Boarder.

Chichen Itza's population used to be 2000, but with the Ocelotl attacks encouraging all deinos to pack together in the city, the population increased to 2400. Only 400 more because the Ocelomeh are intent on hunting the deinos to extinction, prioritizing killing the females so there won't be a next generation. And even if they managed to birth more deinos, they won't exactly be born under favorable circumstances. The deinos will soon perish, be it by Daybit's or Fujimaru's hands.

We come across some vendors, so Rasputin asks about the Lostbelt version of currency. It doesn't have any. Deinos can just take as much as they need from the merchants. The role of the shopkeeper is just to explain the products because the deinos are too different from each other. What nourishes one can be toxic for the other. This moneyless system works for deinos, but Rasputin's opinion is that it wouldn't work for humans because humans have too many needs. Not only of nutrition to operate our bodies, but of happiness to fulfill our minds. This hunger drove us to create more efficient wealth-accumulation systems. Meanwhile, deinos have no need to steal from one another because they have stronger bodies and calmer minds. Tepeu confirms that the only form of conflict existing among the deinos is xoqqer, which is a peaceful religious ritual to pray for the sun.


::: tip Translation note
The name of the ritual is サッカ, which is an intentional misspelling of the word "soccer" (サッカー). This plays into a gag next chapter where Tepeu explains the rules of the ceremony and Mash/Marine react by saying "This is football, can we just call it football?", while Fujimaru gets dialogue options that go

1: This is literally just soccer!	2: This is literally just football!

My summaries and Rayshift's translations will be using the word xoqqer to refer to the ritual, which is our silly little attempt at spelling "soccer" in a way that looks like a Nahuatl word. We hope you appreciate the dumb fun of the thing.
:::

The next question is about the altar of the sun. Its pyramid is identical to its Pan-Human version, except there's a jade pillar atop the altar. Tepeu explains that this crystal is the sun's home. Its origin and endpoint. Every cycle has the sun come out of the ore and return to it after circulating all levels. That's why Chichen Itza is the sacred ground where the deinos built their city. But the pillar isn't a mineral, it's a plant. A cosmic tree piercing Mictlan's underground, with the pyramid altar being only the top of the tree coming out of the ground.

Tepeu doesn't know the Dinosaur King because he left the city before kings were a thing, but he worked there as a priest for a long time before it, so he believes he has the necessary connections to get us an audience with the king. That said, when we get to the altar, the new priest after Tepeu's retirement reacts to the return of the deviant by telling Tepeu to get out of the city and die. Completely unfazed by the hostility, Tepeu cordially greets priest Vucub and makes our request. Vucub answers that the king is too busy with the war to deal with a deserter, and orders the warriors to drive us out of the golden city. Vucub is not on the greatest terms with Tepeu and frequently sics assassins on him. The whole "my connections can get us through" was just Tepeu being too much of a kind airhead to think Vucub would still hold a grudge. With Vucub as the new head priest, we can forget about the idea of talking to the Dinosaur King.

Out of solutions that can be done overnight, we decide to stay at Tepeu's Chichen Itza house and become part of the community until we can get our message across to the king.

---

Olga and Marine managed to enter the city because Olga is visibly not human and Marine was mistaken for Olga's accessory. Since our audience was refused, Olga suggests plan B: destroy the altar so the king will lose his legitimacy and they will be free to do whatever. Rasputin convinces her to avoid diplomatic incidents. We move to Tepeu's house, and it's looking almost like the jungle due to how long it has been abandoned.


[ <-Battle against the wild animals that occupied Tepeu's empty house-> ]

Tepeu's home is renewed, thanks mostly to the house-cleaning gods Marine and Kotomine. After that, Tepeu asks Mash for exposition on the Pan-Human version of Chichen Itza. This is where Fujimaru learns that Mayan and Aztec mythologies are not the same thing. Skipping the parts you can find on Wikipedia and focusing only on the Nasu-original elements, this section tells us that the Mesoamerican Age of Gods ended with the fall of the Mayan civilization in 900CE. The Aztec god Quetzalcoatl is a later development created from an existing prototype: the Mayan god Kukulkan. It's also noteworthy that when Mash gets to the part about the Spanish colonization of the Aztecs, she goes in depth about Hernan Cortes's tactics. His association with Quetzalcoatl feels familiar to Fujimaru because he's also a conqueror from another land being treated as a guest by Tepeu. Tepeu's opinion on the story is quite different though.

---

**Tepeu:**

By firearms, do you mean the tools that the Ocelomeh use? Conquerors from the outside world. The suppression and slaughter of local tribes with firearms. This is identical to Mictlan's current state. So the deeds of Crypter Daybit are a reenactment of Hernan Cortes.

---

Tepeu wants to know more about Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca, but it's getting late. Kirei only has one quick question before everyone goes to sleep. He wants to know who built Chichen Itza. The golden city is too similar to its Pan-Human counterpart to be a deinos construct. Tepeu answers that Kukulkan did.


## Chapter 5: Life In Chichen Itza (I)

People wake up and do their morning greetings in Tepeu's house. Marine slept instead of going into spirit form because he wouldn't be able to materialize again since he's not the main Nemo. That's not the best since there are only 19 Marines now, as 4 out of the original 24 died in Atlantis and 1 more died in Britain.

Olga remembered more of her powers, so now she can show us videos of the routes to the Dinosaur King palace and reveal that the throne is empty. The king seems to be hiding elsewhere in case of an Ocelotl raid. From the information she could gather from the deinos brain waves, there's only one way for them to get their audience with the Dinosaur King. The law of the deinos says that the winner of the xoqqer tournament gets the right to speak with the king and be touched by Kukulkan.

We need eleven players in a xoqqer team, so we need to go to town and recruit or join a winning team, preferably join. This time we get Olga to compromise and also accept the deinos disguise sacrament. But Kotomine refined the sacrament overnight so that only the deinos will see us as deinos, meaning we don't get to see what deinos sprite Olga gets.

However, Olga wants to compete against Fujimaru, so they will each form their xoqqer team and take it to the tournament to see who made the best team. It's actually a better strategy to have more teams infiltrated in the tournament because any of them winning achieves our goal. So we go team 1 with Fujimaru and Mash, team 2 with Olga and Kotomine, and team 3 with Tepeu and Marine.

---

Fujimaru and Mash walk around the city, seeing many deinos and their casual conversations. Mash goes into an absurdly lengthy infodump about Pan-Human dinosaurs, to which Habetrot reacts with just an "Ok, so what's the strongest dinosaur?". In Mash's opinion, it's the deinonychus. This doesn't help us because there are not many deinonychus-like deinos in town.

We go to the arena to see all the players warming up. There we meet Team Death Rolling, a team of 11 deinonychus brothers who once won 7 tournaments in a row. Despite claiming to be 11 brothers, Fujimaru notes there are not 11 of them there. The deinos confesses a few team members are suffering from cocoa intoxication. Mash and Fujimaru ask to join their team, but they were originally trained by Tepeu before he left the city, so they can recognize Tepeu's smell in them. They challenge the two to a quick match to determine their mettle.


[ <-Xoqqer match against the 7 deinonychus brothers-> ]

Our xoqqer skills bring the deinonychus brothers to tears and we get accepted into the team. Turns out the team sucks because they're all offensive players, except for their defenders who happen to be ones who are unable to play because of the aforementioned cocoa intoxication. They're clearly not the kind to think things through. Their default strategy is diving into the enemy team because the deinonychus are small and light, and so get easily sent flying causing the opponent to get a yellow card for it.

---

As a proud former student of King Leonidas, Mash is putting our xoqqer team through the hardcore Spartan training routine. The team deinos are unsatisfied with her strictness but understand it's important to win because that pain in the ass Vucub doesn't let anyone see the king otherwise. Their team hasn't won since Tepeu left because he would analyze the enemy teams and formulate strategies for them. Also in the glory days of their 7 consecutive tournament win streak, they were free to exploit their aforementioned diving tactic, but Daybit's arrival updated the rules of xoqqer so their opponents could get away with 3 fouls per game. Now they needed to get knocked away 4 times to expel each defender, and that's what caused the death of the 4 absent brothers. The cocoa intoxication story was a lie. Despite this, the remaining brothers still love xoqqer.

The xoqqer team clearly misses Tepeu and wishes he never left, but they understand how isolated he must have felt in the city when no one else would share his desire for knowledge. They think company would be worse than solitude for him. But they're glad to be proven wrong by the company Tepeu is getting in Fujimaru and Mash.

The team then warns Mash and Fujimaru that every xoqqer player needs to have their own ball to offer as tribute to Kukulkan in the ritual. They point to the forest in the west, where they need to extract resin to make their xoqqer balls.

---

Back at Tepeu's house, Tepeu and Marine are home, having already formed Team South American Nautilus before we joined Team Death Rolling. Olga and Rasputin still aren't back from the team-making mission. We remind Tepeu of the participation requirement. Tepeu sends Marine back to pass their strategy to the team while Tepeu goes with Mash and Fujimaru to gather material to make everyone's balls. He guides them to the latex trees, where the group is ambushed by Ocelomeh.


[ <-Battle against Ocelomeh-> ]

After defeating the Ocelomeh, they hear even more gunshots. Following the sounds, they find a maskless human boy who appears to be a child version of the afterlife man who will later be revealed to be Tezcatlipoca. The boy shoots at the Ocelomeh for putting their fingers on the trigger and then not killing him. The child complains that Daybit is not instructing the jaguar warriors right. He sees Mash and Fujimaru and asks why they aren't wearing their masks. He implies he doesn't need a mask because he's ranked above Ocelotl. Fujimaru and Mash's lack of masks is against the Ocelotl rules, but he lets it slide because they didn't aim their guns at him. He disappears, musing about how Mictlan is doomed because the deinos and Ocelomeh can only think about winning the war. Tepeu later comes back carrying the whole trees we need to make our balls. We tell him about the human boy and he thinks we hallucinated the kid.

---

Everyone is at the dinner table. Tepeu will make everyone's xoqqer balls overnight, having them ready just in time for the tournament. They go to bed early because the tournament is early in the morning. Fujimaru can't sleep, so they go outside and find Olga on the rooftop watching the deinos city life. Olga's eyes can faintly see the Storm Boarder as just an iron box among the dense trees. She can't give us any details on the crew's situation, but she can count 12 people there, so we know everyone is still alive. She chides Fujimaru to go to sleep, and here we find out that Olga doesn't sleep. She can shut down as a safety measure during an emergency, but she doesn't dream. Olga can see from the brain wave color that Fujimaru feels sorry for her and she's insulted by it. They still try to treat her as another human regardless of their differences, much to her annoyance. But she does have a vague feeling failed at something important before because she gave up before she tried, so she will try sleeping tonight.


## Chapter 6: The Striker Of Burning Flames


[ <-Level 150 Olga battle against all Grands-> ]

---

**U-Olga Marie:**

Uttely trifling! And they call themselves Grand Servants? These are what mankind proudly recommended as their ultimate existences? What a horn and a half! Well... to be fair, they did damage the left half of my horns; that much I will admit. I did not come out of this unscathed. However! The result remains the same: flawless victory for me! This battle has made it clear that this Earth's mankind isn't worthy of being unified under me! I won't overlook their survivors any longer! Time to go confiscate that 'Storm Boarder' or whatever it was called! Muahahahahahaha!

---

Olga wakes from the Grand-killing flashback, excited to have learned what a dream is. Everyone is already up and planning the schedule for today's games. There are 8 teams playing, so the finalists will be playing 3 matches. Tepeu and Marine are in the opposite side of the bracket, so they could only face Fujimaru or Olga in the finals. Olga enthusiastically tells Fujimaru about how great she was as an enemy of humanity killing all 7 Grands in her dream. It was a really awkward conversation.

---

The xoqqer ceremony starts and Team Death Rolling is ready for it thanks to Mash's intense training and tactical knowledge. The "11" Deinonychus brothers consider Mash and Fujimaru two extra siblings.

We're promptly taunted by our first opponent, Great Death Claw, the wacky captain of Team Tah IhGah. She commands a team of destroyers who minimize their ability to hold the ball to maximize the destructive power of their tackles. However, our Team Death Rolling decimates them off-screen without as much as a gameplay battle. All three Chaldea teams advance to the second round, meaning Death Rolling is now up against Olga's Team Scary Eleven.

Scary Eleven scored 100-0 in the first game thanks to Olga's aggressive playstyle and Coach Kotomine's cold-blooded strategies. All we have to compete against this is... actual knowledge of football tactics. This is the de facto finals of the tournament, as Olga puts it.


[ <-Xoqqer match against Olga's Scary Eleven-> ]

---

Team Death Rolling obliterates Team Scary Eleven because Earth sports are too complicated for Olga. The final is Team Death Rolling vs South American Nautilus. But we have injured players, so Olga asks to replace one. Fujimaru is asked to go to the merchant to grab some ice packs and herbal bandages for our injured brothers.

Fujimaru got safely to the shop, but the merchant can't serve them immediately because he was serving Daybit first. Daybit is getting herbal bandages, yellow cucumber for hydration, peppermint perfume to use as a bat repellant, honey orchids, sturdy vine ropes, and alumite because he's working on a makeshift spacesuit. Daybit thinks Fujimaru's deinos disguise is pretty well-made, even if it doesn't last a whole day. Daybit is here because he's preparing for a journey and you can only find quality goods in experienced shops, so his 1-year-old Mexico City's trade network proves insufficent. Daybit buys Fujimaru a bag of the exact same products he bought for himself.

Fujimaru is full of questions but Daybit doesn't have the time to humor them. He thinks small talk isn't entirely pointless, but it's just not his thing. Daybit tries to leave because the clock is ticking, but Fujimaru begs him to answer at least a question about the Crypters. It actually gets Daybit to stop because the question was not about the Crypters' role, it was about his feelings for his friends.

---

**Daybit:**

I don't have a lot of time, but that deserves an answer. Kadoc is doing about as well as he could so far. Ophelia's death was a waste. Akuta's death was inevitable. Peperoncino died alone, bringing an ironic conclusion to his past. Beryl was the only winner in all of this. Kirschtaria's failure happened in the planning stages. Yeah, I know. I will have put an end to Chaldea on my own. I figured from the get-go that I'd have to. But those are just my own impressions. Maybe they helped, maybe not. Next time we meet, ask me a different question.

---

Fujimaru is back from their grocery trip with a bag much bigger than expected, but doesn't tell Mash about Daybit just yet. Vucub is about to announce the finals but he receives the news that South American Nautilus forfeited the match. This is the first time a finalist ever forfeits their sacred xoqqer match. An unprecedented insult to the ceremony. Tepeu reasons that there's no point in playing the match since we get to talk with the king either way. Marine gets sad that Tepeu forfeited for them without consulting, so he lies that he'll thank the team for the two victories and runs in the opposite direction. Olga demands Tepeu run to Marine and think about why it was wrong to leave him out of the competition while he's at it.

---

**Tepeu:**

W-We're talking about a sense of fulfillment that comes with achieving the goal of the collective, an individual's feelings are not particularly important.

**Tepeu:**

(The reason Marine left the group...the reason he wanted to participate in the ceremony... Did he just want to play xoqqer? No, that can't be it. Marine is gifted with a high intellect. While his emotional fluctuations may be intense, he has always been capable of making the right call. He prioritizes the collective and has been taking the initiative in supporting it. So why did he leave the group, even though we have achieved our shared goal? I don't understand. I don't know why, but I'll follow Marine and... I don't understand the reasoning, but I do know that I have made the wrong call.)

---

Tepeu gets to Marine who starts beating his chest for interrupting Marine's alone time. His fists are too weak to deal damage, but Tepeu still feels his heart hurt. He apologizes for not consulting Marine and admits to not understanding his mistake, asking what was the problem. Playing a game they don't need to win is just opening themselves to making more mistakes. Marine agrees that Tepeu's approach was correct and that the results were perfect, but results are not all that matters. The process needs to be fun too. Tepeu finally understands, but this line of thought scares him a little on the inside. He can tell Pan-Human History is a civilization that makes mistakes that defy reason and logic.

Meanwhile, in the sacred arena, Vucub rules that the forfeit is to be accepted and that the winners may speak to the Dinosaur King. Vucub recognizes Fujimaru and Mash's faces, but the king says he'll do what the champions want anyway because good xoqqer deserves to be rewarded. Fujimaru asks permission to cross the great plains. The king warns them that they'll die if they come close to Mexico City. And then...

---

**Dinosaur King:**

Damn it, I couldn't see clearly because the veil was in the way. You guys aren't deinos, are you? That disguise is Pan-Human magecraft, eh? You accursed tricksters. Shed those disguises and die.

---

Priest Vucub panics, mistaking Chaldea for Ocelomeh, and calls his greatest fighter, Wak Chan.


[ <-Battle against Wak Chan-> ]

---

Wak Chan is the greatest deinos hero, so the damage we inflicted on him in our fight was minimal. Vucub keeps egging him to fight more violently, but his increasingly gruesome comments cause Wak Chan to stop fighting to tell Vucub how messed up the things he's saying are. Wak Chan reveals that for the longest time, he was planning to quit the fighter job and settle down with the most beautiful woman in Mictlan.

---

**Priest Vucub:** 

How can you, born with such great power, say something like that!? Even if the King himself allows it, I will never accept it! If you want to keep your status as a fighter, then you must obey me and kill the Ocelomeh!

**Wak Chan:** 

Didn't you just hear me talking about resignation? Besides, I just found my soulmate.

**U-Olga Marie:** 

Hm? What are you doing? Why are you pointing a flower at me? ...is that poisonous?

**Wak Chan:** 

Nice to meet you, somewhat prickly lady! I knew you were the one the instant I was struck by your lighting! Your horns are freaking amazing! After this fight is over, wanna marry me? 

---
This comedy bit was so funny that the Dinosaur King decides not to get Chaldea killed. He announces to the audience that we aren't Ocelomeh, we are the humans who rode that flying rock from the other day. The Dinosaur King reveals himself to be that human boy from Chapter 5. Vucub insists to the king that Chaldea is still evil and should be killed, to which the king agrees because they're out to end Mictlan, but first he asks Fujimaru to empty their pockets. Fujimaru has Tezcatlipoca's calaveras de azucar, so the Dinosaur King lets Chaldea live. Vucub gives up any further fighting because the Dinosaur King is Kukulkan's chosen one.

The boy asks to talk somewhere else, away from deinos ears. He wants to have a conversation not as the Dinosaur King but as Lostbelt king Tezcatlipoca. Kid Tezca asks why did they come to the Lostbelt. Fujimaru and Mash are hesitant to answer in front of Olga, but Olga herself answers that it's to purge the Lostbelt and find ORT because they 'don't have anything to hide'. Hearing about Olga being an alien, Tezca finds it amusing how the aliens always go for Latin America.

---

**Dinosaur King:** 

But why are you helping Pan-Human History? Is Chaldea blackmailing you?

**U-Olga Marie:** 

Haah!? Rude! I have no weaknesses they could exploit! I came here to rule the Earth, but there's no point in that if the planet's wiped clean. So I simply decided to cooperate. That's all there is to it. I don't think they're the type to blackmail someone or take a hostage...

**Dinosaur King:** 

I see. So you're interested not in Chaldea, but in their objectives. That's fine. Better that than some stupid reason like sympathy or friendship. But you, Stargazer Tepeu. This is our first meeting. Why did someone who retired to the first level return to here?
And in the company of individuals from Pan-Human History. You know what they're up to, right?

**Tepeu:** 

Yes. Pan-Human History, Lostbelts, Chaldea, Fantasy Trees... I am still investigating them in my own way.

Dinosaur King:** 

... And you do it by joining them on their journey, huh? Fine then, got nothing more to say to you.
You're free to understand everything, be disappointed and die all alone. If you still call yourself a deinos after all that, the Sun will surely be saved. Alongside your foolish dream. 

---

Kid Tezca tells he's not exactly the Lostbelt king, just a proxy threatened into defending Chichen Itza. But he's fully dedicated to this task because the doesn't have anything else to do. That said, he won't fight us. He knows it's not worth the effort because we won't be able to eliminate the Lostbelt anyway.

He will, however, call a porter to take us to the great plains faster, as the xoqqer champions deserve all the rewards he can offer. He tells Fujimaru not to expect to find anyone alive, however. They fell into Ocelotl territory 5 days ago, and good Ocelomeh would have killed everyone by day 1.

---

**Mash:** 

Ah, excuse me! You're actually the god Tezcatlipoca, right? Then could you help us restore Pan-Human History?

**Tezcatlipoca:**

No way. I don't give a damn about Pan-Human History. Why should I side with the monkeys? Dinosaurs are so much cooler! After all, they're the strongest animals who ever lived, right!? 

---

## Intermission (I)

# 4 DAYS AGO


::: tip Translation note
The word "day"(日) refers to a day in Pan-Human time. A period of 24 hours. It's a word used only by the characters of Pan-Human origin, such as Chaldea, Daybit, and the Mayan/Aztec gods (including the Dinosaur King). The deinos exclusively use the word "cycle"(回), which refers to the 36-hour period it takes for the sun to complete her Solar Itinerancy through all 9 levels of Mictlan. Since a cycle in Mictlan lasts 36 hours, you may mistakenly assume that Fujimaru and Mash have been away from the Boarder for 180 hours, but since the Dinosaur King last chapter said they've been separate for 5 days, that means it only has been 120 hours. And this intermission takes place 96 hours ago, not 144.
:::

The Boarder team is doing the post-crash damage assessment and control. They could confirm Mash and Fujimaru's life signals, but they only have enough energy for a 6-minute conversation with Mash. The Nemo series is functioning normally, but Captain is crashed and frozen. He fully synchronized with the ship and froze his Saint Graph. In this state, the ship didn't break apart in midair because Nemo's body couldn't break apart. Sion believes not even fixing the ship can bring Nemo back to life, but the Nemo Series disagrees, asserting that the indomitable Captain can bounce back from anything.

The team decides to inform Mash they will be noncommunicable for a while, but don't fill her in on the details to prevent her and Fujimaru from taking any rash decisions. Now they have to survive and fix the ship. That's when the adult version of Tezcatlipoca appears and introduces himself as an arms dealer. He came to see this ship that fell into his Lostbelt. It reminds him of Noah's ark. He likes what sees and asks Meuniere for the price. Meuniere says it's not for sale, which is the perfect answer for the merchant since it means he gets to take it by force.

Tezca shoots Meuniere in the heart, then in the head. Next, he calls in his Ocelomeh, commanded by the Ocelotl King Izcalli.


[ <-Kadoc battle using only Nitocris against the Izcalli and his Ocelomeh-> ]

Tezcatlipoca taunts Izcalli over his performance against Nitocris, but he insists he's just getting the hang of how to fight Servants and that he'll kill her soon because he must eventually become Tezcatlipoca. Nitocris taunts Izcalli that he's a measly human trying to fight against an incarnation of a god. Then a new girl appears, asking Nito if the measly incarnation of a god wants to fight against an actual god. The girl introduces herself as Tezcatlipoca's little sister Tlaloc. She readily defeats Nitocris, but doesn't finish her off, instead keeping Nito alive so Nito she can suffer a slow death. Tezcatlipoca says that if she won't take Nito's heart, he will, but Tlaloc warns her brother against unnecessarily coming in contact with the blood of other mythologies. Tezca tells his sister to shut up because she's just a city's local rain god and a Servant summoned by Tezca himself, but Tlaloc insists this would be objectively dumb because while she's still in her divine form, her dear brother Tezca is using a human's body. Tezca agrees, remembering how sick he got after he tasted Hindu flesh. He thanks Tlaloc, calls her a good sister, and shoots her.

---

**Tezcatlipoca:**

A hierarchy stands, even among family. Those who impede a king's will must offer their lives, even over good advice. That's how your word remains law. A king must be an existence transcending good and evil. Bear that in mind, Izcalli, if you want to remain a human king after becoming a god.

---

He commands Izcalli to retreat leaving Tlaloc behind because some little bullets can't wound her. Tezcatlipoca takes Kadoc, da Vinci, and Sion as his new ship's engineers (as well as Nemo because he's the ship itself) and orders the men to kill the rest of the staff.

## Chapter 7: Guns, War, Bereavement

Fujimaru's party is riding Wak Chan, who runs as fast as he can to get them to the Storm Boarder's landing site. Olga checks the Storm Boarder, notices there are more than the 12 people Fujimaru mentioned, including some corpses, and tries to go there ahead of the rest of the group. Fujimaru stops her because she can't meet Goredolf before he's properly informed. We get there and find all the dead bodies.


[ <-Battle against the Ocelomeh who killed our staff-> ]

While we were distracted fighting the Ocelomeh, Izcalli took Marine hostage at gunpoint. Izcalli introduces himself as the king of Mexico City and asks for Fujimaru's name in return.

---

Izcalli introduces himself as the king of Mexico City and asks for Fujimaru's name in return, but Fujimaru refuses to say it. Izcalli is overjoyed to get no respect because he didn't want to respect us either and only asked their name because Tezcatlipoca's law demands it. If Fujimaru summons a Servant, Izcalli shoots Marine dead, but if the team wins the fight without a summon, he'll free him.


[ <-Battle against Izcalli and his Ocelomeh. Using Mash is mandatory but using any other Servant is optional.-> ]


::: tip If you don't solo Mash
Izcalli keeps his promise and executes Marine. Marine apologizes for being always a burden and assures us that we don't need to tell Captain about him.
:::


::: tip If you solo with Mash
The battle is far from over, there are still many Ocelomeh around to fight and Mash is severely damaged, but Fujimaru still can't summon because Izcalli has Marine. He wasn't expecting the hostage to work in the first place because he assumed the world destroyers didn't have any level of mercy. Marine is very frustrated about being viable as a hostage. He shouldn't be because he's replaceable, not very useful, and doesn't feel pain. So he decides to "do his job as a sailor" and gets himself shot so we can fight properly.
:::

---

Olga flashbacks to her previous conversations with Marine. Marine is very efficiently building a cottage while Olga comments on how valuable his presence is. Marine re-explains the Nemo Series mechanism, reinforcing how important it is that the Marines are completely replaceable. As long as Captain is alive, he can be revived. They're all copies, so that new Marine will be unarguably the one Marine she knows. As such, he says he wouldn't mind dying as he won't be truly dead or forgotten so long as there are other Marines alive. However, his brain wave color tells Olga that he was lying. They're not 100% identical. Our Marine was more of a crybaby than the group standard, which only became exacerbated after being separated from the group removed his need to keep a brave face in front of the other Marines. Marine was her first supporter since she lost everything but her name. They promised to save Earth together. He was weak but remarkably skilled in his recon, cleaning, construction, and transport roles. He loved Olga's sense of responsibility. He understood her as someone who hates being the only one doing all the work but doesn't run away from what she can and should do. So he promised he wouldn't let himself be a burden to her.

In the present, Izcalli feels everyone's anger and comments about how normal humans are in the wrong for treating death with sorrow and rage.

---

**Izcalli:**

For us, death is natural, as it is for all humans. If we didn't believe that, we'd never be able to kill anything. It is because all life has equal value that we are allowed to kill. [...]If we have compassion for our brethren, war is impossible. You people of Pan-Human History treat the mourning for your fallen as if it's expected, or as if it brings you salvation. With your level of intelligence, you'd think the same goes for the enemy side. And that's how you lose the ability to take lives. If all hearts contained compassion, war would stop. It wouldn't even start. But is that how it goes, wretched people of Pan-Human History? You kill despite being capable of empathy. You plunder the lives you revere. How do you resolve this contradiction? The problem with you people is apparent before morality even enters the picture. [...] An Ocelotl is nothing like you Pan-Human History apes. It is to Tezcatlipoca alone that we offer up our feelings. We rejoice at our god's joys. We grief at our god's sorrow. And we tremble at our god's wrath. That is all. No matter how many of our enemies or brethren die, the sin of anger and mourning is for a god to bear. That makes war justifiable. If not, the human way of life would be too ugly and sinful.

---

After the speech is over, Olga swiftly annihilates Izcalli's entire squad of Ocelomeh.

---

**U-Olga Marie:**

Pathetic. Are you done making your pitch, human? Then die! If you so wish to die by the hands of a god, I will comply!

---

As Izcalli's body crumbles, he questions why he lost when he is on the morally correct side of the conflict. Olga then apologizes for that excessive violence so unbefitting of the one who rules the planet. The team discusses Marine's eventual return, showing that Olga is the only one aware that her crybaby Marine was lying about Captain being able to revive him specifically. She thinks about how absurd it was for someone with such a strong heart to call himself weak.

---

After Izcalli is fully dealt with, the party enters the Boarder and sees the bloody scene of the tragedy. Tepeu feels like he should have died instead of Marine. The Marines on board confirm Fujimaru and Mash's presence and call for Goredolf. Meuniere aside, the staff is unharmed. Flashback to how they were saved.

Despite the damage caused, Goredolf tries to negotiate peace with Izcalli, in an attempt to solve matters quickly so Meuniere could be carried to the medical bay as soon as possible. Izcalli is having none of this, so all Ocelomeh train their gun on the director. Since Goredolf is about to die, Koyanskaya summons her Light version to his location and outguns the Ocelotl firearms. All the blood and flesh in the hallways is Koyan's doing. By the way, she only knew Chaldea was in danger because, even after all this time, Goredolf was still carrying her lipstick around, having felt it impossible to throw away.

Headcount in the ship: 8 staff members, Goredolf, 11 Marines, 4 other Nemos, Nitocris (almost dead), and Koyanskaya. 26 people. The 12 Olga counted before were 9 people and 3 Servants (counting the whole Nemo Series as 1 Servant). But after the whole situation with the one Marine, Olga can no longer see them as the same individual.

Fujimaru is glad Goredolf is grouped with Koyanskaya because that makes it a lot easier for them to justify being grouped with Rasputin and Olga Marie. Goredolf takes the Rasputin part in stride, he always thought Rasputin was the only reasonable Apostle, but Olga is a bit too much for him to accept. Olga can see from Goredolf's mind color that he won't trust her and won't be her friend, so the Directors start arguing with each other. In a slip of the tongue, Goredolf says "who do you think knocked the ship down?" and Olga demands an answer because she wants to make the culprit pay. Since Goredolf refuses to tell, Kotomine proposes earning Chaldea's trust by healing Meuniere with the power of Bahloo the Moon, an Elemental he has as one of his High-Servant components. Goredolf finally accepts Olga into Chaldea since that's what it takes to get Meuniere saved.

---

Meuniere is back to life. He asks Fujimaru and Mash not to blame themselves. The staff's creed ever since the Romani days was to allow Fujimaru to return to their original home one day, and he doesn't want them to come back depressed. That was what motivated the whole staff to keep on going. They were all people of different races, professions, and often opposing Clock Tower factions, but their shared pride in supporting Mash and Fujimaru brought them together.

Goredolf sends Mash, Fujimaru, Habetrot, Tepeu, Olga, Kotomine, and Koyanskaya to rescue da Vinci, Sion, Kadoc, and Nemo in Mexico City. Wak Chan will stay behind as the Boarder's guard, as much as he'd prefer to go with Olga. Before leaving, Koyanskaya asks about Fou. No one knows where he is. Fujimaru thought he was with Goredolf and Goredolf thought he was with Fujimaru. This ruins Koyanskaya's plan to take some Fou fur, but she knows Fou well enough to figure out he's trying to keep away from ORT. Koyanskaya's guess is that Fou is chasing tumbleweeds on the surface and will only come back after the Lostbelt is destroyed.

Meanwhile, Nemo Professor teaches Tepeu the spell necessary to reboot the frozen Captain. He's clearly still not over Marine's death, despite how the others do indeed seem identical to him. Olga already fulfilled her promise of bringing Fujimaru and Mash to the Boarder, but she can tell they still need her help, so as much as she dislikes Goredolf, she'll be joining the rescue mission. The Alien Priestess watches this decision take place.

## Chapter 8: Iztauhqui, The Second Underworld Border

The second underworld border, Iztauhqui, is a mountain climb slowed down by powerful winds. Falling off causes you to land on obsidian spikes that deal minimal damage but can cause a deinos to bleed out should they fall too many times. Olga isn't worried about either obstacle because she weighs over 10 kilotons.

After the first border, we enter the place already expecting it to look different from Tepeu's description. The stone spikes are now as sharp as swords, and the winds blow at 10-20m/s. Still, at least we don't have to worry about hypothermia because the honey orchids from Daybit's grocery bag are conveniently with us. Nor about falling off because Daybit bought us sturdy vine ropes to tie us to Olga.

Late into the climb, we comment on how Lostbelt Iztauhqui's "walking through wind and blades" gimmick is identical to Pan-Human Itztépetl's gimmick which is also identical to Japanese folklore hell's gimmick. Camazotz shows up, not a fan of the hell comparison. He notices that the party composition is different, with Marine replaced by Koyanskaya, and figures out Marine died. He's really disappointed and asks Chaldea not to let themselves be killed by other people. That's his privilege.

Koyanskaya has no patience for Camazotz's smug cackling villain antics and gets ready to take Fujimaru's Command Spells back. Camazotz recognizes her as the woman who sold all the Ocelotl guns and carried Daybit away once. Koyanskaya confirms that she sold guns on a one-month trial period, but Tezcatlipoca, her worst client ever, didn't even subscribe after the trial was over. He simply reverse-engineered the products he already got and started making his own guns.

But enough chit-chat, Camazotz is eager to learn what Servant summons look like and revive his Mictlan with the blood of the Chaldean sinners.


[ <-Battle against Camazotz's dead summons and his Boss Ghost form-> ]

---

Camazotz still hasn't got the hang of Servant summoning, so he is forced to pull the "I turned Chaldea's Servants Alter" card again, this time calling Beni-Enma Alter to challenge us. The proxy judge of hell announces our sins shall be judged by her blade.


[ <-Battle against Beni-Enma Alter-> ]

Beni Alter's gimmick is that she can use the mountainous terrain as her insta-death swords. U-Olga gets hit, but manages to reboot her brain after shutdown, nevertheless unsure if she'll be able to do it a second time. Beni Alter says she has understood what crimes we're being charged for, hands us a 10 quintillion years sentence, and flies away mid-battle, interrupting it for no discernable reason. Koyanskaya is crying over what happened to her dear sweet Beni.

---

Beni lands atop the tallest mountain waiting for us. We just need to cross the mountain range to clear the trial, so Olga proposes ignoring that one and going across a shorter mountain to get this over with. Kotomine adds that if we ever want a rematch against Beni, we can have it after rescuing Chaldea's hostages. Only Koyanskaya takes Beni-Enma as a priority.


[ <-Battle against handmaid and hell guard onis -> ]

One day later, Fujimaru notices we've been on an endless loop. This whole time, we've been climbing the same mountain six times. Olga expands her sensory range and detects that the mountain has no exit. The Aztec underworld is a set of trials that the dead pass, but Beni-Enma's presence has converted it into the Japanese hell, which is an inescapable prison until the end of their sentence time.

---

We need to get rid of Beni-Enma to leave this hell. Even Koyanskaya agrees. Japanese hell revives the killed sinners, so we can counter her insta-death slashes with a Servant able to withstand the suffering of dying and reviving again and again and again. That said, Kotomine's spirit healing can't reverse Beni's Alter transformation. Protea Alter had a mask he could amputate, but Beni Alter is just the regular Beni-Enma forced into adulthood. Becoming the proxy king of hell after an eternity of training is Beni-Enma's natural future, so Koyanskaya proposes that Fujimaru summon a Servant with de-aging magecraft or a de-aging Noble Phantasm.

We check our options, but can't think of anyone with a de-aging Noble Phantasm. Dagda is feeling too overshadowed by Odin, so he has commanded Fionn to message Chaldea offering advice. It's the underworld, basically a transit point to the Throne of Heroes, so Servants can just talk to us without needing to come out of the summoning circle. Kotomine internally questions Tezcatlipoca's intention of designing the underworld like this, and starts to wonder if the goal of the underworld borders is not what it initially seems. Fionn acknowledges that de-aging NPs are a major rarity, but they don't specifically need a Noble Phantasm to get the job done. De-aging can be done with special medicine and Chaldea knows one hero that carries such a substance in his treasury's vast collection. With this hint given, Fionn tells us to say hi to Beni for him and disappears.

Anyways, we get (Caster) Gilgamesh talking from behind the summoning circle. He gives us his youth potion. Kotomine mentions the king he knew wasn't this generous and Gilgamesh tells Fujimaru to behead Kotomine before he betrays them. Gilgamesh retells the story of how he went back to the underworld later to get the youth herb. You can make Fujimaru say they already heard this story before, and if you do, there's a mini-flashback justifying this knowledge as "Gilgamesh told Hakuno who told BB who told Fujimaru".

---

Our team will fight to wear down Beni-Enma Alter so Koyanskaya can force-feed her the potion and get her dear Beni-Enma back. Beni threatens us with her mountain blades weighing 8100kg. Olga recommends Fujimaru pick Servants with high insta-death resistance and to keep Mash away from the fight.

::: tip Note
8100kg is the specific weight of Ruyi Jingu Bang in Journey to the West, but I'm not seeing how this correlates to Beni-Enma's character
:::

[ <-Battle against Beni-Enma Alter-> ]

::: tip Gameplay gimmicks
Beni-Enma's regular attacks have a chance to insta-kill. Olga has guts that trigger only on insta-kill. There's a surprise King Hassan locked to the last slot for reasons the story doesn't acknowledge in any capacity. Your whole team gains insta-kill resistance when he hits the field.
:::

Our tiny bodies can slip through Beni Alter's mountain-sized swings. For small targets like us, this is nothing compared to normal Beni-Enma's short and swift katana. Koyanskaya runs her bike across the rocky surfaces and finishes the job, administering Gilgamesh's potion with some mouth-to-mouth. Normal Beni-Enma greets us, apologizes for her Alter's actions, has some banter with Koyanskaya. She can also talk about Fujimaru's stay in the Enma-Tei depending on whether or not Fujimaru did that.

Fujimaru confirms the 2nd Command Spell return, but Beni-Enma still has to remain behind as the guardian of the underworld. At least she's now able to change into adult form at will. Beni promises to train hard for the vaguely explained upcoming battle involving all guardians of the underworld.

## Chapter 9: The Lost Water Metropolis


[ <-Battle against Ocelomeh on the road to Mexico City, accompanied by their tamed deinos and NNF-brand devil hummingbirds-> ]

Mexico City is a busy commercial district with roughly 30k people about on the streets. It has a population of 100k fighters + separate villages of women and children for support. Tezcatlipoca made the place very urban and modern-looking. Kotomine disguises let us infiltrate but we can't make sense of the Ocelotl language. That means we can't talk to the locals and find out where the prisoners are being kept.

So the first places we look for are Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli's temples. They're 60-meter-tall twin temples in the very center of the city, with sacrificial altars on top. Tlaloc's temple is home to Izcalli and Huitzilopochtli's temple is home to Tezcatlipoca. The characters are still unclear if Huitzilopochtli is just the Aztec version of Tezcatlipoca in TM or not.

Koyanskaya never saw Daybit in Mexico City before. He leaves the whole war and urban management in Tezcatlipoca's hands so he can dedicate all of his time to exploring ruins in the forests.

The group then starts exploring the city, but Olga and Tepeu have to stay behind outside since the human disguises that Kotomine made for them would easily be busted if they tried to enter the crowd with Tepeu's dinosaur size or Olga's wide horns. However, Olga orders all of her special secretaries to learn everything they can about Ocelotl life, culture, and ideologies. It's their duty to take this opportunity to learn about the enemy because it's cowardly to use ignorance as a shield.

---

The team splits up to explore the city. Fujimaru is with Mash (and consequently Habetrot). They all seem agitated, but we can't tell why because of the language barrier. That is until we find someone mentioning in a Pan-Human language that the ritual is tomorrow. It's Cuauhtli, one of the first Ocelomeh to learn "Daybit's language". She's a trendy Ocelotl who hopped on the language fad because King Izcalli spoke it. She's concerned about battle and security because of the rumors of the Chaldean conquerors arriving. We trade some items at the market and give her the one she wants (the calaveras de azúcar we got from Tezcatlipoca after giving him our Command Seals), so she thanks us by dropping major hints that she's Kukulkan while she reveals we can save the hostages tomorrow at their sacrifice ritual but we'll have to fight the whole Ocelotl population for it.

After everyone is regrouped and we report our findings, Tepeu asks about the importance of human sacrifices to Mayans and Aztecs. Kotomine gives his lecture on Mesoamerican mythologies. Mostly stuff you can find by googling as usual, but this one contains Kotomine hot takes such as:

-The Aztec cycle of extinction and rebirth was caused by the people being influenced by the continent's memories of the meteor causing the end of the world.
-The Aztec empire became doomed to fall for magecraft reasons, as they stopped doing human sacrifices to grant them new futures.
-Hernan Cortés pretending to be Quetzalcoatl was Moctezuma's idea to gain support to win the tribal wars, but he got out-gambitted after La Malinche explained the plan to Cortés.

Tepeu comments that there is precedent for a night of terror in Mictlan where the sun disappeared, so the Ocelotl sacrifices seem to have the same classic effect of restoring the sun.

Back to the main topic. Kotomine has found the prisoners underground below Tlaloc's temple. It's too guarded to invade, so the plan is to infiltrate and rescue them during the moment of the festival where all warriors must kneel.

---

Izcalli gives his farewells to Mexico City before the ceremony. Tlaloc warns him not to be alone when the sunless night comes. He asks about the modern Pan-Human outfit Tlaloc is suddenly wearing. She put it on because Tezcatlipoca said she should try to blend in with civilization, as humans hate outdated gods. They also comment on how the Aztecs misunderstood Mayan traditions. They couldn't hope to achieve anything with random blood from their sacrifices. Sacrifices are meant to offer noble warriors to the gods in exchange for blessings. The ritual will use Chaldea's mages and da Vinci because they're rarer than deinos are. They can serve as the last step to the resurrection of the true Tezcatlipoca. After one year of war and sacrifices, the Ocelomeh will awaken the weapon to destroy Pan-Human History, exterminate the deinos, take over Mictlan, and take over as the next mankind.

As the one who retrieved Izcalli's body from the river, Tlaloc is very concerned about Izcalli's resistance to death making him arrogant. Izcalli's answer is "I look down on then, but that doesn't mean I'm underrating them." They're warriors who aren't ready to see their comrades die. At one point in the conversation, Izcalli mentions this repulsive mindset of them makes him feel hatred he never felt before, but in another he mentions Pan-Human History is not worth acknowledging. Tlaloc points out this emotional contradiction and tells Izcalli to reflect on what that means.

Meanwhile, in Sion and Kadoc's cell, Sion is failing to connect the comms. It feels like the building is in a completely different world or inside a living being or a spaceship. Kadoc hears footsteps and tells Sion that Fujimaru finally arrived, but the person who shows up is actually Daybit. Daybit clarifies that the attack on the Storm Boarder was Tezcatlipoca's independent decision and that if Daybit was there to have any say on the matter, he would have killed the four of them instead of taking them as prisoners. Sion introduces herself and Daybit says he got her name and face memorized now. He's not as competent as Kirschtaria but no one has a better memory than him. He recognizes Sion as the greatest threat and promises to kill her first if they ever share the same room again. The only reason he's not killing them now is because Tezca got to them first. Daybit and Tezca are not on good terms as Master and Servant, so Daybit is too afraid of Tezca to go against what Tezca wants. Tezca gets described as the kind of abusive husband who leaves without telling and gets home nonchalantly saying "Hey, I spent all your money, my bad".

Tezcatlipoca is a big deal. He got to Mictlan, this space dominated by extraterrestrial life, and in just one year he established rules, summoned his temple, raised the Ocelomeh, built Mexico City, and chose its king. This Lostbelt is Tezcatlipoca's world, not Daybit's. So while Daybit doesn't think Chaldea will be able to excise the Lostbelt, he doesn't mind if they do, as long as they're willing to wait 10 days. That's the time Daybit needs to fulfill his objective. Down his last moments, Kirschtaria's will never wavered, so for that reason, Daybit will follow through with his plan.

Daybit then finally asks the question he came here to ask. Why didn't Kadoc use his Sirius Light to summon a Servant to free Chaldea from the prison? A Sirius Light is simply a Command Spell dozens of times more powerful. A trump card to send your Servant any otherwise impossible command. The only drawback to it is that it is a bomb. It inflates the user's Circuits and causes them to implode. Marisbury didn't have full trust in the Crypters' ability to clear all 7 Singularities, so he chose 7 Crypters and equipped each with a Sirius. If any Crypter failed the mission, Beryl would detonate their Sirius Light, solving the Singularity by obliterating its entire region. The only reason why Ophelia and Kirschtaria didn't explode their Lostbelts with theirs is that they were already dying upon activation. They died before their Circuits blew up, thus preserving Chaldea's lives. So that's the trump card Daybit believes Kadoc still has. If Kadoc activates his Sirius Light and then immediately kills himself, he can accomplish pretty much anything.

Daybit leaves and Sion is impressed at how much the "hole in reality" is exactly like he was described to be. The more he talks, the less she can believe he's real. But Kadoc adds he's a caring, tactful, and perceptive guy. He only says what others need to hear, so this infodump about Sirius Light will eventually be significant to Kadoc. Sion agrees to keep the Sirius Light talk a secret.

Another conversation between Fujimaru & Olga. This time because Fujimaru can't sleep before the big operation. Olga mentions the importance of rest and proposes a solution. If Fujimaru can't sleep, she simply has to fatigue them until they can. And so she sends them to her BB Channel rip-off.


[ <- Battle against Olga's virtual enemies. Wave 1 is all Servants Olga used in Lostroom. Wave 2 is Tlaloc. -> ]

![](https://i.imgur.com/Tg286YD.png)

Fujimaru comes out of the simulation saying it's the shittiest game they've ever played. 

---

**U-Olga-Marie:** T-That can't be true; I spent all day balancing it! Just exactly what part of it was so bad? I command you explain!

(choice 1)

**Fujimaru:** It had too much flirting with your highness, the President.

**U-Olga Marie:** okfsklvhbseiovas!? T-T-T-T-That c-can't be it, right?! I did it all shounen manga style! I even simulated some enemies for you!

---

(choice 2)

**Fujimaru:** It was shittier than the shittiest movie I've ever seen...

**U-Olga Marie:** W-Wow, what an incredibly sad color you're emitting... Hmph, just you watch. Next time I'll come up with a much more interesting battle! 

Regardless, the enemy fought in Olga's simulation was Tlaloc, so Fujimaru understands Olga meant this as a practice run for the very likely real Tlaloc battle they would have to face the next day.

## Chapter 10: The Day Of ORT

The ritual has begun. The Ocelomeh are offering their prayers to the sun and in two hours, the sacrifices will be carried to the altar. The team infiltrates the temple. Koyanskaya grabs an Ocelotl and tortures him off-screen for the location of the cells (she actually traded corn and bananas for the information, but she's telling everyone it was seduction and torture). Sion and da Vinci were already moved to the altar, but we rescue Kadoc and Nemo from their cells. The ritual is about sacrificing the strong, so despite Kadoc's bigger Circuit quantity, they still recognize Sion as the better mage because Six Sources' physiology is beyond everyone's comprehension. Tepeu applies the medicine spell Professor gave to reboot our crashed Captain.

Tepeu is speechless for a moment because of how much Captain resembles the Marine he lost. He apologizes and formally introduces himself. Now to save Sion and da Vinci.

---

We introduce Kadoc to Olga. She's immediately worried about his huge eyebags, but Kadoc assures her everyone who uses anti-beast magecraft looks like that. It involves always being on guard against enemies stronger than human beings. Kadoc is pretty shocked about the insane party we have assembled with Kotomine, Koyanskaya, and Olga, only for Fujimaru to point Kadoc is in the same boat as them.

Anyway, here's the plan: Fujimaru, Nemo, Mash, and U-Olga ride Tepeu and be a big distraction, while Kotomine and Koyanskaya stealthily rescue da Vinci and Sion amidst the commotion. Kadoc keeps watch to see if Kotomine and Koyanskaya aren't tricking Chaldea.

Olga's team interrupts Izcalli's big speech, something he was already expecting. Mexico City's best warriors were in position for this big moment. The Ocelomeh already have all the hearts Xibalba needs, but Chaldea's heads still have value to them.


[ <-Battle against Izcalli and his elite warriors-> ]

Izcalli is defeated by our heroes, but he still can't allow a future for our world, so he orders the priests to kill Sion and da Vinci immediately to drop Chaldea's morale. Unfortunately for him, Koyanskaya already did her part. We try to retreat, but Tezcatlipoca arrives with a warning shot to stop us. He recommends we kill everyone before we leave since we never know when we'll manage to invade the enemy base again. We didn't sense his presence approaching because Mexico City is his world, so he's technically omnipresent there.

Izcalli begs Tezcatlipoca to let him finish his job of killing Chaldea, but Tezcatlipoca reminds him that his role is not to kill enemies or to rule the Ocelomeh, it's to survive for a whole year, because his body is Tezcatlipoca's. Tezca then notices Olga on our team. He's surprised she survived, but should have expected it since she calls herself a god. He asks if she wants a rematch and this dialogue gets Olga to remember he's the one who damaged her horn in her fight with the 7 Grands. Tezca says he could take Fujimaru and Kadoc on his own, but since Olga is joining the fight, he's passing the baton to Tlaloc. She arrives, bringing with her a powerful rainstorm. However, thanks to Olga's simulation training, Fujimaru already has a counter-strategy ready for Tlaloc's currents; one which involves using Nemo or any other Servant that floats in the air or can stand against strong currents.


[ <-Battle against Tlaloc-> ]

::: tip Gameplay gimmicks
Tlaloc's Savage Metztliapan stuns all Servants every turn, except for floating Servants. The effects of Savage Metztliapan are also offline while Nemo is on the field. She also has Bountiful Rain healing 30k HP every turn.

We beat Tlaloc and celebrate "avenging Nitocris". Tlaloc corrects us, saying that her river floods didn't affect Nitocris at all. Nito lost to the god of war, not the rain. So Tlaloc changes her Class and True Name, from Ruler Tlaloc to Berserker Huitzilopochtli.


[ <-Battle against Huitzilopochtli-> ]

::: tip Gameplay gimmicks
Huitzilopochtli generates 3-times invincibility every turn. Also every turn, she fills her whole NP gauge and gives herself an NP damage buff. But instead of proper Noble Phantasm, Huitzilopochtli uses a defense-lowering attack named Lamentful Coyolxauhqui.
:::

We're beaten by Huitzilopochtli's sturdy skin and fast spinning. Tezcatlipoca is also keeping Olga busy with the black smoke that she can't damage. The original sacrifices escaped, but Fujimaru and Mash's blood will do just fine. When things start to look dire, the Cuauhtli girl from before pierces Tezca's smoke and rescues us. She takes off her jaguar mask and reveals herself as the creator of Mictlan, Lostbelt king Kukulkan. Fujimaru almost immediately takes note of her personality's similarities to that of Quetzalcoatl.

---

Kukulkan wrecks Huitzilopochtli with a fully animated punch and now she's gunning for Tezcatlipoca because he and Quetzalcoatl were rivals in Pan-Human History (actually Maia's consensus but she's using her Pan-Human counterpart's mythological background as an excuse). She off-handedly mentions that Tezcatlipoca is human, so he has to explain that he's a Pseudo-Servant. He created a human body for himself and transferred his divine soul to it, so he counts as a living human from the present. Learning that gets Chaldea thinking this is a fight they can win. But they're quickly proven wrong by Tezca ordering Daybit to use a Command Spell.


Mash, Nemo, and Olga try to stop Tezca mid-NP chant but it's too late. Mictlan is collapsing. Mexico City and all Ocelotl living in it were decimated by ORT. Nemo is turned to crystal.



Tezcatlipoca and Kukulkan have tasted many ends of the world before, but Tezca refers to them as mere entrées compared to the luxurious main-course prepared by the skilled Daybit Sem Void, a master chef that even the Alien God could not anticipate.



Learning Daybit's goal, Fujimaru calls him out on being no different from the Alien God, which provokes a visible reaction on both Daybit and Olga. However, Daybit corrects them on one thing: unlike the Alien God, Daybit is an actual enemy of humanity.



Daybit jumps down the falling debris. ORT is now too close to avoid.


[ <-Battle against ORT-> ]

::: tip Gameplay gimmicks
You need to break ORT's first gauge to progress but after clearing the win condition, the battle still lasts for as long as you can last. All of ORT's attacks are AoE, including his NP: Cosmic Ray Burst. CRB clears all your buffs, reduces natural NP gain by 200%, and reduces the amount of NP charged by a battery by 100. After hitting the win condition, ORT starts filling his whole NP gauge to spam Cosmic Ray Burst every turn.
:::

We can't do a thing against ORT. Olga's black hole attack only serves to keep him away while she talks Fujimaru out of their panic state. ORT is walking in the Storm Boarder's direction. We try to tell Goredolf without our comms but we're chronologically disconnected from him. Kukalkan rushes to the Boarder, lifts it, and hops to Chichen Itza to keep it safe.

Despite all our panic about ORT eating the Boarder, we're suddenly back in the present. Turns out Tezca's Authority had a time limit. Nemo is also back at this point but since ORT only hit him in the future. Everyone is concerned that he's guaranteed to die again once those 10 days pass, but Nemo explains that the premise of the future Tezcatlipoca grabbed ahead of time is that ORT appears, so ORT appearing is the only event that is set in stone. It could be that 10 days later, nothing happens to Nemo.

Kotomine and Koyanskaya have already escaped Mexico City with the hostages while we were in the future, so now it's our turn to get away from the furious population of Ocelomeh.

---

Tezcatlipoca's ritual was a complete failure but he's still elated over the show he got to be part of. Tlaloc, on the other hand, is quite concerned about the future image of her city in shambles, and about the steep price that her brother paid to reorder those events. Tezca refuses to order Daybit to heal him because Daybit needs to be in top shape to complete the Underworld Pilgrimage. Tlaloc really wants to defeat Kukulkan since she hates any version of Quetzalcoatl, but the loss of her city and people really is the biggest thing on her mind.

Tezca tries to console her saying that the Ocelomeh deaths are inevitable because they're all dumb battle junkies. Tezcatlipoca personally educated Izcalli not to be like that, but even he completely loses sight of his well-being when he gets a gun in his hands. Either way, he doesn't care about anyone's losses. Tezca is on the side of the battle itself, and he's betting his chips on Daybit because Daybit's wins are the ones that would produce the biggest loot. Tlaloc, on the other hand, is betting on Izcalli. He has the potential to improve exponentially if things go right for him.

Tezca's final advice to Tlaloc is that the one thing she's lacking is the ability to enjoy entertainment the way Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl do. She denies it, believing that the freedom to embrace entertainment and the wish to learn about other cultures is what killed the Aztec civilization. Protecting Mexico City and its population is the only thing she feels is right. That said, she's aware it won't come to be. Her brother will destroy the city and Izcalli will become the new Tezcatlipoca after his 1 year of maturation.

The Ocelomeh are quite openly disappointed with Izcalli's kinghood, as he was defeated by Chaldea twice by this point. They want the incompetent king gone. Izcalli is just as salty and disdainful of them, saying he'll gladly leave once he fully becomes Tezcatlipoca. He'll get out of this sickening imitation of a Pan-Human city and build his own utopia with no sacrifices, weakness, accumulation of wealth, or pointless battles.

Izcalli's scar starts aching, so takes off his helmet, leaving it exposed. His scar has been aching a lot ever since Chaldea arrived. Still, he thinks his losses were minor. Sacrificing Chaldea was a spectacle for morale, which can easily be regained by giving his people new guns. Deinos hearts are still worth more as sacrifices. He grew somewhat hesitant after seeing ORT's future firsthand, but he's Tezcatlipoca's chosen one. His duty comes with honor granted to no king other than him. It won't be long before he can destroy the world and build it anew.

Meanwhile, Camazotz just learned that Tezcatlipoca's extinction plan is using ORT, so he makes his choice to protect Pan-Human History. It's currently a blank scroll, but the scroll itself is still precious, so he's against Tezca destroying it. Camazotz doesn't mind the scroll having nothing written on it because he's not enough of a fool to ever read what happened in history. He believes he's the only worthy candidate to be Mictlan's king because Tezcatlipoca only cares about the present and Kukulkan only cares about the future. Still, ORT is a terrifying threat. He doesn't want to repeat the mistake from 6 million years ago. He ponders his options. Side with Chaldea or wait to take out the wounded winner at the end of the battle? Ultimately, he decides to kill Fujimaru and become humanity's last Master.
