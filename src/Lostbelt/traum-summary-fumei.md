## Prologue

Aboard the Storm Border, Da Vinci and Sion are having a discussion on what constitutes the "perfect human being". Da Vinci, thinking the topic too vague, first moves to define the concept more closely. Sion suggests then that "a perfect human is one who never errs".

**Sion:**
Rather than overcoming hardships or making the impossible possible,
what if we define perfection as...a "lack of error in a person's judgement"?

Da Vinci agrees on the terms that, no matter the issue at hand, or the oversight by the person, if they could solve the issue they would surely be a genius, but the fact that such a situation was allowed to arise in the first place proves it was not the "perfect choice". As such, perfection simply has to refer to "a state without error". In other words, someone who always makes the most optimal decisions, who never makes any oversights. As a consequence, as soon as an oversight were to be made, that person would stop being perfect. Sion counters this by positing that there exists a perfect problem such that even the perfect human would make an oversight.

**Da Vinci:**
If a problem capable of fooling even an unerring, perfect human exists, that is.
Oh, but then consider this case:
The mistake is not necessarily a mistake at all. The person purposefully overlooked the problem.
A "perfect human", precisely due to their perfection, wilfully ignored the problem.
For that is a problem that ought not to be solved. Therefore,
the very fact that they overlooked the problem is in and of itself proof of "a perfect decision, a perfect choice"...
Something like that? That might be leaning too hard on the semantics, though.

The conversation is cut short by Nemo entering the bridge, reporting that the ship is about to depart from the Arctic Circle. He says that the two of them should go ahead and proceed with their routine update reports (even though they may only consist of recaps), and so they do.

Sion recounts how shortly after the destruction of the British Lostbelt, and the peace brokering with the Larval Beast, Koyanskaya, the Wandering Sea was lost due to the actions of the Alien God. They made their escape on the Storm Border with the rest of the staff, using the gravitational collapse of the Wandering Sea to create a distraction. Thankfully for any future adventures, Trismegistus II and SHEBA were both loaded onto the ship beforehand, so this is their new base now. They ended up hiding out in the Arctic Circle for some time, as it was considered the safest place by Trismegistus II, and they seem to have escaped the Alien God for now.

Da Vinci continues by reporting that the Holy Sword Essence acquired in Britain has almost finished being turned into a proper weapon, and they simply have to run test simulations on it now. Now, you're all headed to South America, where the Alien God, and your final confrontation, awaits. They also mention that you'll get there by crossing over North America first. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/DCxyUN0.png)

In addition, Nemo seems to have agreed to a certain name for the Holy Sword, though we're not made privy to what that may be.

Suddenly, an announcement blares across the bridge.

**Announcement:**
An obstacle not accounted for in Novum Chaldea's anti-Alien God protocol has been detected.
———Detecting decline in the attestation values for Pan-Human History of the bleached Earth.
Risk of transience upon the present due to interference with the past has been confirmed.
Chaldea staff are requested to urgently initiate the Rayshift execution sequence.
According to SHEBA's observations, this is one of the "largest direct attacks on Pan-Human History" ever made.
It is a large-scale Singularity.

## Section 1: The Coffinmaker is My Only Friend

In the darkness, we listen to a sorrowful monologue.

	———A soliloquy.
	■■■■■■ cannot comprehend ■■■■■.
	They cannot discern whether dead or alive, standing or sitting,
	whether thoughtful or thoughtless, begging alms or offering prayers.
	They know not a thing. They express no pain, nor any joy.
	No fear, yet no relief.
	Only an impending premonition and a chill informs them that the end has come.
	They merely die meaningless deaths in such a way, on such a stage.
	Yet something confined inside me helps them prolong their life just a little longer.
	It begs them to remain human until the very last moment.
	Do not pray, but sing. Right now, that's all ■■■■ can do.

A player choice, perhaps ours, perhaps not, appears:
■■■■ a ■■■■, ■■■———

That darkness fills with numerous red lights, and turns to a swirling mist, in which the monologues continue, this time seemingly by someone else.

	———My soliloquy.
	Yes, precisely. I must be a traitor.
	A traitor to Pan-Human History, and to the principles of honesty.
	Most assuredly a circumstance of my own incompetence. Or perhaps it would better be called competence?
	My sins, my fate, my obligations. The day to put an end to them will arrive at last.
	Here, beneath the falls we named Reichenbach.

Back on the Storm Border, Sion is giving a briefing about the upcoming mission. It has an unstable date, although it is not later than 1700 AD, though there may be a deviation of at least 100 years. Based on vegetation, it is presumed to take place in what was the USA in your proper history. Additionally, while it lacks the magical energy density of the Age of Gods, it seems to be experiencing bursts of magical energy, as if someone is wildly throwing around anti-army Noble Phantasms. Furthermore, it has received the Human Order Foundation Value "ERROR". That is to say, not EX, which is usually given to that which is immeasurable, because this one isn't even that much. Neither is it something small such that it would be below E- rank. There are simply no clues as to what this means right now, so you'll have no choice but to forget about it for the time being.

As for the Servants to accompany you, you're limited to three Servants, though this limit is actually decreased to two, since one of the positions is saved in case Mashu needs to be sent in as emergency reinforcements. The reason she isn't coming along right from the start is that the Ortenaus is still undergoing maintenance, and so she wouldn't be able to fight as the events in Britain may have caused her Saint Graph to drift out of sync slightly. Instead, one of your Servants will be Holmes this time. He is both compatible with the Singularity, and should be able to provide a lot of insight as to what's going on. Your other Servant will be Vlad III (the Berserker version). Before this, by the way, Fou whines and scurries off.

![](https://i.imgur.com/mc2Bpxx.png)

However, there's one more special surprise. One more special companion on this adventure. If they were to send two Masters into the Singularity, a lot of options would open up, and so, they're sending none other than Kadoc! With his Lostbelt being gone, and his refuge in Olympus as well, he had no real choice but to surrender to you after he woke up again. He's now currently outfitted with a collar.

![](https://i.imgur.com/PYgPSMX.png)

**Sion:**
Right, right. What we have here is the Atlas Institute's hand-crafted magus-killer collar.
If he takes any suspicious action while we're monitoring...
The collar's function activates, completely destroying his magic circuits.
The same applies if he tries to force its removal. It isn't necessarily meant to kill by design...
But the intentional disruption of magic circuits caused by this collar would most definitely result in death.
Oh, and be aware that unauthorized use of magecraft will also trigger the collar.

As you extend a hand to greet him, he scolds you for revealing your hand so casually. As a Master, your hands, especially the one carrying your Command Seals, reveals a lot of information about you. As it turns out, this scolding isn't just Kadoc being a little grumpy about the situation, but part of the reason why he's coming along this time. You might have had the aptitude to be a Master, but that didn't automatically turn you into a trained mage. That's where Kadoc comes in, as he'll be able to teach you some of the more fundamental things.

Sion also reveals to Holmes that she was not able to remove the Sirius Light from Kadoc, but that it shouldn't necessarily pose a problem. If the Alien God could remote activate it, they would've surely done so by now, and as it still constitutes magic, if Kadoc himself tried to use it, the collar would kill him.

Now, all that remains is to Rayshift into, and resolve, the largest Singularity ever observed, ere the course of the very world as you know it be twisted.

---

We're treated to another monologue in the dark.

	Whatever the era, whatever the place, whatever the ideology...
	Nothing is more difficult to succeed in than war.
	There is nothing but artless death there. Neither race, gender, nor age factor into it.
	There are those who get by on their skill, effort, and luck. Even those meet an anticlimactic end in the face of death.
	In death, living things become a mere lump of flesh, that is the natural order. Be that as it may, with Servants, this fails to occur.
	When they die, they fade away. There's no sign of having been there. No record of their presence.
	Death so abrupt it confounds the mind.
	Whether they are heroes who saved their homeland, or anti-heroes that brought them to ruin...
	They nonetheless die as though it were only natural, for whatever the reason.
	War never changes. No matter how time passes, nor how civilization develops.
	Killing one another is simply the final step of any negotiations.
	These heroes have but one goal———to rebel.
	Not against a king, not against God, not even against the world.
	It is a rebellion against Pan-Human History.

![](https://i.imgur.com/rj8tStS.png)

The scene changes to that of a castle covered in red and black. Multiple men stand before a woman carrying a large blade.

The castle was unbearable, even for the veteran heroes summoned as Servants.
In this castle stood crimson brilliance and darkest insanity. Any man less than a hero would fall to madness.
The beauty before them was the embodiment of that insanity.
Her name is Kriemhild.
In the Nibelungenlied, she was a princess who vowed revenge for the murder of her husband, Siegfried.

![](https://i.imgur.com/F3HmVDi.png)

The woman, Kriemhild, blames the men—these nondescript Servants—for various crimes on the battlefield. Desertation, letting the enemy slip past, over-extending in pursuit. Each Servant responds to their respective accusation with attempted justification. "My retreat was due to Rider's disruption. If I'd held my ground, death was likely", "That was no enemy. It was just a child", "I am to blame. I rightfully accept my punishment."
Shivering, they await the Queen's decision. But even in the face of certain death, holding one's ground is not meaningless.
As such, the Queen cuts down the Servant in cold blood.
Neither do children exist on this battlefield, only Servants.
As such, the Queen cuts down the next Servant in cold blood.
Finally, the last of them is spared for but a moment. But thinking to act obedient in order to have one's life spared in such a shrewd and cunning way is wholly unnecessary.
As such, the Queen cuts down the final Servant in cold blood.

The massacre concluded, another Servant enters the throne room, a Caster which Kriemhild refers to as Zhang Jiao. He sends puppets to take care of the Queen's mess, and proceeds to report that the war on the frontline remains in a stalemate. Despite all his puppets, and the knowledge from his Taiping Yaoshu, he simply cannot expediate the process any more. He mentions that more Servants have been summoned to the battlefield recently, and when prompted, replies that the "Via Regia Realm" has not yet made a move, other than sending their scouts out. Kriemhild suspects that they're waiting for the other two sides to be locked into battle, only to then take out the remainder.

![](https://i.imgur.com/LZIGa9M.png)

**Zhang Jiao:**
One last thing, your star of fate has just now taken a shine.
The one coming who will bring important changes to this Singularity. I speak of———

**Kriemhild:**
Chaldea.

Kriemhild seems ecstatic at the thought of being able to inflict pain upon a mage of Pan-Human History. She orders more scouts to keep an eye on Via Regia, as well as for Chaldea. Abruptly, another Servant enters the chamber, this time it's Salome, who has left what is apparently her torture chamber. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/w4EJvGN.png)

Salome, seemingly having no real idea about anything, asks who Chaldea are, and more importantly if they have good heads. Kriemhild explains that they are enemies, no more, no less. Salome doesn't seem too bothered either way, and decides to go out to buy some cake. At the same time, Zhang Jiao leaves to tend to an experiment of his.

![](https://i.imgur.com/sFu7J27.png)

**Kriemhild:**
Insufferable, insufferable...
Chaldea, der Große, and the Emperor. I hate each and every one of them.
It's that hero who's to blame for all this. If he isn't summoned soon, I'm going to break down.
Hurry, hurry, hurry...

---

The scene changes once again, this time to a castle clad in white stone, draped in rejuvinating sunlight. Various soldiers are reporting to their leader, who is being accompanied by a girl—a pope. The girl tells the man not to mourn the loss of one of his soldiers. Though his sorrow may be appropriate, it is misplaced. All of them, including her, fight with the resolve to give their lives for his sake. However, he doesn't seem to think he's worthy of such a thing. The girl responds:

![](https://i.imgur.com/AtWER4c.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/TNa7oVt.png)

**???:**
One's worth is determined not just by themselves, but by others.
However much you may deny it, however much you scorn or blame yourself for this dream-like children's story.
You have our love and respect, heavy though they must be.

The man, who the girl refers to as Emperor, responds by saying that he believes that to be too heavy a burden. Even so, they will stand firm in their belief of him. However, the Popess has a question for him.

![](https://i.imgur.com/I4b21iv.png)

**???:**
All the barbaric atrocities and merciless cruelties performed in my name.
Are they committed not because we are on the brink of death, but because it is what you want?

The Emperor seems to lack a definitive answer to this question, although apprehensive at the thought that the Popess would be against it. However, she merely states once more that she would even sacrifice herself for his sake. Perhaps this is all his interpretation of the Lord's voice. Their dialouge ends, her going to worship, and him staying to strategize with his troops before joining her. Soldiers report that a small force from the Revenge Realm invaded, but were repelled by thirty Archer-class Servants using their Noble Phantasms. However, some of the other Servants stationed there had broken formation, defying orders. One of them has been brought in front of the Emperor, and is being questioned for his motives. However, when the Servant clearly displays remorse, the Emperor grants him mercy. Likewise, two quarreling soldiers who had disrupted the troops are assigned to support the rest from the rearguard in the next battle. Finally, a Caster, whom the Emperor seem to imply had a connection to Alexander the Great, stands in line to be judged. Before his misdeeds can even be brought to light, the Emperor cuts him down.

**???:**
———No. That's the one thing in this realm that I forbid.
We do not acknowledge Pan-Human History. We acknowledge nothing but rebellion.
That goes for cooperation and mercy as well.
I thought you realized as much when you came over to this side of things.
We are beings who defied the flow of history, who were swallowed up, and some even erased.
The bonds shackling us to defend the Human Order have long disappeared, and I———
I simply must make Pan-Human History pay. Though that grudge may be completely personal, I suppose.

In a nearby chapel, the popess' prayers are interspersed with narration.

![](https://i.imgur.com/tvbPHww.png)

"I am not in error. I am not mistaken," she prays.

At first, her prayers were not for herself, but only for others.
Prayers for something. Prayers for someone.
That was proper, since one can justify their position by way of devotion.
Even so, this prayer is only for herself.
Her sin is no sin. Her atonement is no atonement.
And yet, that contradiction is only the result of devotion that comes to fruition here.
A contradiction driving her into inescapable torment.

"Please deliver me salvation," she prays.

She simply murmured a wish for which she did not even know towards whom it should be directed.

![](https://i.imgur.com/83qPK42.png)

As the Emperor joins her in prayer, she hopes that she can shoulder some of his burdens.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bcEmAmM.png)

Once more, the scene changes to another castle. This time, it's a more timid throne room, where the throne itself is concealed by a large curtain. Behind it, we merely see two shadows. A soldier's report states that the other two sides engaged in bloody conflict, then each retreated. Astolfo and Roland are the ones receiving the report, although it is nothing they don't already know. They may have the smallest number of troops, but they are surely of the highest quality. The soldiers praise their king, Karl der Große, and spit on the names of Kriemhild and Constantine. The King agrees from behind his curtain.

The King commands that the scouts be doubled and maintain their training. Their realm might always move last, but it would not be fit for a king to move carelessly. Roland leaves along with the troops. Astolfo poses a question to the King once they are all alone, indicating that perhaps the King is really having to make an attempt to keep this up. The other shadow behind the curtain seems to think they're doing a poor job, but the first shadow disagrees. However...

**???:**
The enemy scouts are penetrating deeper than ever.
Sure enough, this charade won't hold up much longer...
The venerated Karl der Große simply hasn't shown at all...
He's suffered some kind of wound, or something more serious.
It's natural to come to that conclusion.
But if I bucked up and stepped into his shoes...

![](https://i.imgur.com/0iuo20B.png)

Astolfo tries to lighten the mood with a joke, but it falls flat. What they need is something to distract from the King. Astolfo proposes that maybe such a thing would be a fourth faction joining the fray. Suddenly, the King perks up. He will recall all scouts, and send all troops for this purpose. One of the shadows says that they sense a turning point for the King here, while the other shadow agrees.

**???:**
Yeah, of course. I'll show everyone what Don—Karl der Große is made of!

Now all he has to do is wait for that fourth faction—that organization.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ycMurIP.png)

One final scene change brings us to the Chaldea party, who have just Rayshifted into the Singularity. Kadoc says that he experienced a burning feeling during it, and indeed, it seems like something was off about the process. However, you're all there, all alive, and nobody got shot out to some other location, so best not to worry too much. Communications with Chaldea are still working (for once), and you find out that there should be a small town nearby, which should be your first destination. You explain to Kadoc that your first course of action is always to gather information.

![](https://i.imgur.com/pNKeUHQ.png)

Kadoc asks if you've made use of Suggestion spells, then, but you obviously haven't. He thinks it's amazing how you've apparently just waltzed into places and outright asked people weird questions without any sort of hypnosis or anything. Da Vinci explains that your Mystic Code does remove most of the physical pain when using magic, so Kadoc might as well go ahead and teach you some of that later.

As you move out towards the village, Holmes trails behind, looking up at the sky.

The clear blue sky. A gentle breeze makes a pleasant sound on the grassy meadows.
Every bit of it is tranquil. Peaceful.
———And for that reason, they couldn't help but have a frighteningly ominous premonition.
The subject of that premonition was...
Not Kadoc Zemlupus. Not Fujimaru.
And not Vlad III. Not even Sherlock Holmes.
It was, despite all odds, this girl alone who felt there was no choice but to send them into the Singularity.

As we cut to Da Vinci back on the Storm Border, the scene fades to black.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HdJZk85.png)

**--ARROW--**

![](https://i.imgur.com/5oGutrQ.png)

As you arrive in the town, you immediately notice that it's all in ruins. There are no signs of recent human activity whatsoever. Holmes asks Kadoc if he can use magic to perform an analysis of the ruins. Of course, Holmes can deduce a lot of things about this place by himself, but getting to the most minute details is difficult without magic, and so you're lucky you have a proper mage with you this time.

Furthermore, Holmes theorizes that the ruins aren't man-made, but magical in nature. Kadoc's analysis seems to support this. The whole town is woven together using magic, almost like a Caster's Territory Creation Skill. It would be difficult for any normal mage, but quite easy for a Servant. Holmes refers back to there being no recent human activity, but says it's more appropriate to say that there never was any.

**Holmes:**
It is akin to a movie set, metaphorically speaking.
There are faint traces of use, but not over an extended period of time.
This place was constructed in an instant by a Servant or a magus.
Or so I would like to believe...

But if this town was made by a Servant, or something equivalent, then who destroyed it? It was no disaster of nature, but clearly caused by clashes of war. This was a battleground of Servants. Coincidentally, Mashu reports that Servants are approaching your location, but...there's something wrong. There's an entire army of them. Da Vinci confirms as much, adding that there are about a hundred of them. Before you can take this in, Mashu reports another similarly sized army approaching from the other direction. You're currently being surrounded by close to two hundred Servants. It will be very difficult for you to slip out of here. You and Kadoc will have to conceal yourself within the town, with Vlad and Holmes will try their best to slip past or break through the troops. Worse comes to worst, you should use up all your Command Spells for a slim chance at survival. In the meantime, Holmes wants you to pay close attention, to get as much information about the approaching Servants as you can.

You and Kadoc dig out a hole, and get a big piece of debris to cover you up. He proceeds to cast a spell on you.

**Kadoc:**
"Rat's body in hiding. Cat's byway escape. Let shallow cleverness prevail over gathered intellect."

It's some sort of concealment magic, though he says it's very basic. Who knows if it'll fool a Servant, but it's better than nothing. It does help with muffling sound too, but you shouldn't raise your voice needlessly anyway. You take this time before the Servants arrive at your position to ask about Kadoc's type of magic.

**Kadoc:**
No, it's fine... It's on the verge of obsolescence now anyway. Actually, it probably already is.
Telling you about it won't make a difference at this point.
It's anti-beast magecraft, meant for fighting animals.
Man has been his own worst enemy ever since ancient times, but predators were still up there in terms of threats.
No human could win against a beast barehanded.
So, the creation of magecraft to fight them was probably inevitable.
You can probably guess why it's on its way out now.
Both tracking and killing beasts...
All of that can be done with mundane means in the present day.
It's helpful for bringing down beasts of prey———
But those sort of beasts don't even exist in the modern age anymore.
I guess that's the fate of magecraft in general...
The art grows stronger and more stable with time, but eventually loses its purpose.

When you ask if he's ever thought of just giving up on it, he says that if you had asked that of any normal mage, they would've killed you on the spot. It's the equivalent of asking someone "have you ever thought about killing yourself, since your life has no value anymore?" He apologizes for his direct words, but it's cut short by the enemy approaching.

Many Servants appear close to you, seemingly laying out a strategy for a large-scale battle coming up. You can't believe they're actually all Servants, and while it's hard to tell anyone's True Name like this, it's clear that they're all from different ages and regions, yet they're all organized into a single army. There's a limit to how many Servants a Grail or even a Leyline could summon, so how is this even possible? Sure, there are Stray Servants that are summoned by the world or the land, that by definition have no Master, but even then there are never this many of them.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XpDMvJu.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/u1RtfqY.png)

As the other army approaches, a large-scale battle between Servants begins. They clash, and many of them release their Noble Phantasms. Most interestingly, they utilize Command Spells to do so, and have them recharged mid-battle. Terms such as "phantom-grade" and "Heroic Spirit-grade" are thrown about during the clash, as a powerful Caster apparently blocks off the flanks of the battlefield. The strategy previously laid out by the first army has been thrown into disarray, and they are being slaughtered. They seem to be part of Kriemhild's army, and even Kadoc says that he recognizes that name.

![](https://i.imgur.com/3OLC4Ij.png)

Elsewhere, Roland and his troops are watching over the clashes of Kriemhild's and Constantine's armies. Now's their chance to strike hard at the Restoration Realm, he says. Some of his men seem to think that they would be better off waiting until the the two whittle away at each other even more, but Roland charges in regardless. Constantine's army is practically annihilated, attacked by Kriemhild's at the front, and Roland's troops at the back. They are forced to retreat, using Caster's to prevent the enemy from following too easily. Roland's troops don't make it much further than into the town, around where you're hidden. He commends his men for giving the Restoration Realm a good beating, but when he proclaims that it's time to GET NAKED, you can't help but gasp, and you tense up as there's a risk of him noticing you. Luckily, he brushes it off, reiterates that they will spend the night NAKED, and then leaves.

Holmes and Vlad appear to let you know it's safe to come out. Most of the town is flattened at this point, but you retreat to one of the still-standing buildings to share what you've learned.
