# Traum Summary Translation - 妖兰

Note: This summary translation is done by @妖兰#0312 (Melusine) on the main r/GO Discord.

## Prologue

- Da Vinci and Sion talk about their opinions on human perfection and mistakes
- Nemo interrupts their talk and reports that the Storm Border has left the Arctic Circle
- Nemo tells Sion to report on the current situation

- Sion's report:
	- It's been several days since the British Lostbelt collapsed
	- After Chaldea peacefully pacified the young beast Koyanskaya, the Foreign God attacked and destroyed their homebase, the Wandering Sea
	- Everyone of Novum Chaldea's staff was quickly evacuated to the Storm Border
	- U-Olga Marie's power is still something that cannot be properly measured in a normal sense
	- The Spiritron Calculation Engine Trismegistus II and Near Future Observation Lens SHEBA are both built into the Storm Border, Chaldea's new base of operations.
	- Chaldea's journey continues, being on the run from U-Olga Marie while using Trismegistus II's future prediction capabilities to find a safe location to re-locate to. 

- The Storm Border moves throughout the Eurasian Continent, converting the remaining buildings into spiritron resources while staying in long-term stealth mode in the Arctic Circle.
- Trismegistus II identifies the Arctic Circle as the safest place, given that the Foreign God did not attack that location.

- Da Vinci tells that the weaponization of the Holy Sword Essence retrieved from the British Lostbelt is almost finished. All that's left is to run several tests with it via simulator.

- With Gordolf's, Holmes, Da Vinci's, and the rest of Chaldea staff's consent, Chaldea will be leaving the Arctic Circle, and head to the South American Lostbelt to take the fight to the Foreign God.

- Just as Da Vinci finishes her explanation, an alarm sounds. An abnormal situation has occurred. Trismegistus II and SHEBA's future predictions are encountering errors. Unknown hindrances have been detected within Novum Chaldea's Foreign God Subjudgation procedures. 

- A decay within Pan-Human History's proof values has been detected. A current ephemeral threat greater than the interferences in the past has been detected. Chaldea staff are recommended to immediately rayshift to deal with the situation.

- SHEBA is observing the greatest past "Direct Attack upon Human History": A large-scale singularity.

## Section 1: The Coffin Shop is my Only Friend

Soliloquy.
■, ■ can't understand.
Living, dying, standing, sitting, thinking, feeling, wishing, praying.
None of that. Neither pain, nor joy. No sense of unease, nor relief. Only the foreboding knowledge of the end. To die without meaning in a place like this. But, something within was prolonging my life just a little. So I ask, until the end... as what a human should be. Not through prayer, but singing. This is, the only thing, that ■ can do, right now.

**???:** 
(■■■■ it,■■■)

(Red lights flash, and the darkness becomes a dark fog)

Soliloquy.
Ahh, that's right.
I probably am a traitor, for betraying Pan-Human History, and all sincerity. This is probably due to my incompetence, or should I call it, competence?

My sin, my karma, my duty. The day when all that ends will finally come, under the waterfall called Reichenbach.

---

(Scene ends, then shifts to the Storm Border Bridge)

Sion begins her briefing on the large-scale singularity. The time period is shaky, but somewhere before 1700 CE at the minimum deviation of at least 100 years. Location is unidentifiable, but based on analyzing the plant distribution, the Far East, Africa, or Europe are ruled out, leaving America. Mana output isn't as thick as the Age of Gods, but observed values of disturbances report extremely high levels continuously rippling like a pond where rain falls. Sion wonders if someone's haphazardly firing off Anti-Army Noble Phantasms over there.

The other factor is the Human Foundation Value being ERROR, something that has never occurred before and not associated with EX rank. Da Vinci explains that the smallest mini-singularity would be classified as an E- rank with no need to rank others below it, but the singularity in question cannot be classified as a singularity in the first place. Gordolf wonders if it's some sort of bug, but whatever it is, it's something with no answer. Only way to find out is to go there.

Sion now introduces the rayshift compatible candidates for this mission: Sherlock Holmes. 

**Guda:** 
"Nice to have you, Baritsu!"

**Holmes:** 
"Hahaha, is that a greeting?"

Since Ortenaus is still undergoing maintenance due to extended use in the Fairyland and Tunguska, Mashu is unable to participate. It doesn't look like Fou would go either, but the next candidate is announced: Vlad III.

Only three candidates are eligible for rayshifting. Mashu cannot rayshift, so Holmes was selected. Vlad was chosen after some...not-so violent methods were used when consulting the other applicable servants. Vlad III reassures Guda and dematerializes until needed.

With Holmes and Vlad chosen, Sion announces one more candidate, a special guest who will also be rayshifting...

**Guda:** 
"One more...?"

**Sion:** 
"That's right. With two Masters, we can cover more ground."

**Mashu:** 
"Sion! you don't mean...!"

A wild Kadoc appears.

![](https://i.imgur.com/H9zVksg.png)

Note: Fun fact - The classic main menu theme plays when Kadoc is re-introduced

Kadoc is a Crypter, but his Lostbelt is destroyed, and his refuge called Olympus is no more. The only option he had was to surrender. Of course it would be hard for Chaldea to believe him, but Kadoc will prove his worth with his actions.

**Guda:** 
"And that collar?"

(Kadoc opens his coat and reveals said collar)

**Kadoc:** 
"You're sharp. Sion, explain."

The collar is a mage-killer device developed by Atlas Academy. If Kadoc were to do anything suspicious, attempt to remove the device, or use unauthorized magecraft, the collar will trigger and destroy all of his magic circuits, killing him. Of course this annoys Kadoc since he's essentially nerfed, but Guda welcomes him to the party. Of course being the senior, Kadoc tells Guda that a magus should not be careless with info and must always watch their Command Seals. Da Vinci points out that Guda, although they do have master aptitude, isn't really a magus, and so requests Kadoc to teach them.

In the back, Holmes whispers to Sion regarding Kadoc's Siriuslight:

**Sion:** 
"He can't release it. Put it on hold for now."

**Holmes:** 
"Understood. If the Foreign God could remotely activate the Siriuslight, then she would had done so. It's not good to be caught off-guard."

**Sion:** 
"You're right. I'll pull the trigger if that Siriuslight, let alone a Command Seal, were to go off."

**Holmes:** 
"Best not to go that option if possible."

Onto the last explanation. There are some keywords regarding the singularity that were extracted by HIEROGLYPH: No problems. Revolt. Two Eyelids.

Guda is confused, and so is Sion. What she thinks of these words are two points: "That you cannot escape from this singularity", "That it is on the same level as the seven singularities". Da Vinci thinks that this singularity will impede their progress to the seventh Lostbelt and thus recommends its destruction. Guda begins their rayshift.

**--SECTION BREAK--**

In any time, place, and idea, nothing is more difficult to succeed than in war. 

Die, die, die, die.

There is nothing but careless death. No race, gender, or age involved. Those who were sustained by skill, hard work, and luck were already dead to the point of disinterest. It is the nature of living beings to become lumps of flesh when they die. Even so, as servants, they are not even allowed that privilege. If they die, they will disappear, leaving neither proof nor records behind. 

To die a crazed yet abrupt death, whether they be a hero who saved a nation or an anti-hero who brought harm. To simply die as a matter of course for one reason or another.

War never changes. No matter the era, no matter the development of civilizations. To kill one another is the final step of negotiation.

They have one goal.
To rebel. Not against a king, a god, nor the world, but against Pan-Human History.

![](https://i.imgur.com/TRd7sHz.png)

(Inside a chamber, three soldiers stand firm)

**???:** 
"Do you understand why you were summoned?"

Even they, veteran heroes who were summoned as servants, found this castle to be unbearable. What lies within this castle is crimson splendor and pitch-dark madness. An ordinary person would go mad from this. The embodiment of this madness is beauty in front of them.

**Class・Saber:** 
"Wait, Kriemhild-sama. I really don't rememberー"

(The beauty walks up and smiles)

Her name is Kriemhild. She is the queen who killed her husband Siegfried and sworn vengeance in the Nibelungenlied.

**Kriemhild:** 
"You fled before your enemy."

**Class・Saber:** 
"...!"

**Kriemhild:** 
"You turned a blind eye on them."

**Class・Archer:** 
"...!"

**Kriemhild:** 
"Your reckless pursuit threw the battlefield into chaos."

**Class・Rider:** 
"..."
"..."

**Kriemhild:**
"Say it." 

**Class・Saber:**
"I fled because Rider threw everything into disorder. Had I stopped, I would had faced death."

**Class・Archer:**
"They weren't the enemy. They were just children."

**Class・Rider:**
"It was my blunder, and I humbly await my punishment."

![](https://i.imgur.com/2Jq9Hnl.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/F3HmVDi.png)

**Kriemhild:**
"..."
"...I see."

(Kriemhild swings her blade, killing off Saber and Archer, leaving Rider unscathed.)

**Class・Rider:**
"...!"

**Kriemhild:**
"Had you stood your ground, even if they were doomed, your subordinates wouldn't had to die such pointless deaths. 

"I sentence you to death. There are no children on the battlefield, and even if they are, they're servants. If you can't even comprehend that logic, then you deserve the death penalty."

"And..."

(Kriemhild slashes Rider, who is barely clinging onto life)

![](https://i.imgur.com/aeqFn6N.png)

**Class・Rider:**
"W....h....y..."

**Kriemhild:**
"You believe me to be a docile maiden who needs rescuing because I have this kind of personality. How shrewd. How wise. I have no use for you.

**Class・Rider:**
"Damn... you... You're just... a... crazed demon... hellbent on... vengeance..."

(Rider is decapitated.)

**Kriemhild:**
"Even now?"

**???:**
"...Ho-ho-ho. 
So you made another bloody spectacle, huh."

**Kriemhild:**
"Isn't cleaning part of your job, Zhang Jue?"

(An old man, Zhang Jue, appears.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/BIUss3w.png)

**Zhang Jue:**
"Why indeed. That's the job for my puppet warriors. Now please!"

(Three puppet soldiers walk up and carry the body away.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/WT23h6G.png)

**Zhang Jue:**
"How are the front lines going?"

**Kriemhild:**
"The situation remains the same. That damned man really is skilled in defensive warfare."

**Zhang Jue:**
"He's a hero who made a name for himself with this tactic. ... Oops, excuse me."

**Kriemhild:**
"And how goes your end?"

**Zhang Jue:**
"I am mobilizing all my Taiping Arts and puppet knowledge, but it will take the entire night to do so."

**Kriemhild:**
"I will provide you time and funds, but you better succeed, otherwise you will leave me no choice but to behead you as well."

**Zhang Jue:**
"Ho-ho. I assure you with all my heart and soul that it will be done."

**Kriemhild:**
"...Hmph. Fine. What about the new servant?"

**Zhang Jue:**
"I see you summoned another one. I thought many of them were at the other encampment this time."

**Kriemhild:**
"Hm ...And the Royal Roads?"

**Zhang Jue:**
"Still no movement on their end. My men aren't finding anything other than just scouting."

**Kriemhild:**
"I see. I suppose they're aiming to play both sides."

**Zhang Jue:**
"They lack the strength for an immediate attack, but it is something that we cannot ignore. What a nasty position to be in."

**Kriemhild:**
"And this lead to our current situation. How annoying."

**Zhang Jue:**
"...I'm afraid so."

**Kriemhild:**
"Keep Assassin on watch at all times."

**Zhang Jue:**
**"Very well. Just one more thing:** your Star of Fate(1) is brightly shining just now."

(1) TL Note: 宿星 (Fateful star, Zodiac)

**Kriemhild:**
"Star of Fate...?"

**Zhang Jue:**
"The one who will bring a momentous change to this singularity has come. Namelyー"

**Kriemhild:**
"Chaldea. ...I see. They've come, and now they're here."

**Kriemhild:**
"Ahh... now what? What should I do? How should I make them suffer, to make them grieve? Beheading is one thing, but such a half-hearted punishment is not enough."

(Kriemhild smiles)

"For the likes of a mere street magus to use us as familiars."

**Zhang Jue:**
"Oh, good heavens. Calm down, my queen. It is a societal norm, more or less speaking, to show some courtesy to your prisoners."

**Kriemhild:**
"Yeah, whatever. Like hell I care."

"...Fine. Monitor them until we know their true intentions."

**Zhang Jue:**
"Our spies are somewhat lacking, though..."

**Kriemhild:**
"Recall back some of the Assassins scouting the Royal Roads. Have them keep an eye on Chaldea for the time being."

**Zhang Jue:**
"Acknowledged."

**???:**
"Are you two done talking?"

**Kriemhild:**
"...How strange for you to come out of the torture chamber, Salome."

![](https://i.imgur.com/s2aY8lE.png)

**Salome:**
"Torture? What's that you speak of? The only thing I want are simply heads."

**Kriemhild:**
"...Fine. So, what's the matter?"

**Salome:**
"What's a Chaldea?"

**Zhang Jue:**
"Ho-ho-ho. First, to explain things in a single wordー"

**Kriemhild:**
"They're the enemy. Nothing more, nothing less."

**Salome:**
"And we have to fight them?"

**Kriemhild:**
"We kill them."

**Salome:**
"I see. But, if there is a valuable head, may I please receive it?"

**Kriemhild:**
"I'll think about it, though I don't think it'll be there."

**Salome:**
"Is that so? How unfortunate... Well, I'll be going out. Would you like me to buy you something? Like umm, a sachertorte? Aren't they delicious?"

**Kriemhild:**
"No thanks."


**Salome:**
"I see. See you later."

(Salome leaves)

**Zhang Jue:**
"Are you fine with her flaunting her self-indulgence?"

**Kriemhild:**
"She's an anti-hero who chose this way of living. There would be no gain even if you deny everything. She's a strong fighter, so let her do as she pleases.

**Zhang Jue:**
"As you say."

(A Caster walks in)

**Class・Caster:**
"Zhang Jue-sama. The experimental preparations are finished."

**Zhang Jue:**
"Oh ho, it looks like I'll be off now. Well then, my queen, if you excuse me."

(Zhang Jue leaves)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Y2wXvhK.png)

**Kriemhild:**
"...Annoying, annoying. Chaldea, that Great Emperor, and that other emperor. They're all so revolting. All of this is that hero's fault. If I don't summon them soon enough, I might soon fall apart."

"I must hurry. Hurry. Hurry..."

**--SECTION BREAK--**

![](https://i.imgur.com/8DEdezR.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/1Wjkagg.png)

(Scene switches to a different throne room, decorated in white and blue)

**Class・Lancer:**
"This concludes my report!"

**???:**
"Well done, you are dismissed." 

**Class・Lancer:**
"Sir!"

![](https://i.imgur.com/d0xuHAJ.png)

(Lancer leaves, then a pope-like figure speaks)

**???:**
"...Yet another hero has lost his life."

**???:**
"Please do not mourn, Pope. Your sorrow is right, but it is only right. We offer our lives to serve you. That's why everyone is prepared to fight for your sake.

**???:**
"I—— don't think of myself as worthy of such value...

**???:**
"A person's worth is determined by others, not themselves. No matter how much you deny it, to despise yourself, to blame yourself for this dreamlike fairy-tale, we will always adore you. It must be hard for you, right?"

**???:**
"Why yes. To be honest, it really is hard for me!"

**???:**
"Hahaha, now that's harsh!"

**???:**
"I wish I could at least face death with laughter and satisfaction."

**???:**
"Pope, we will not let you walk the path of death. This is our oath, and my conviction."

**???:**
"And that is the weight of such a thing! Well okay, fine. Let's just do what we must until the very end! But, I have only one thing to ask of you, Emperor."

**???:**
"What is it?"

"All these acts of treachery, inhumanity, cruelty, and ruthlessness. Are they all for the sake of my wishes, and not just for you to find a place to die?"

**???:**
"That's a hard question to answer. If that is not what you desire... I see. It is a trivial matter, but I will give my life for it. The life of a fallen nation's emperor isn't of any significance."

**???:**
"I—— no, that's right. This might be out of my own self-interest, but I want to see a little more, no, I need to see more."

**???:**
"Is that the Lord's voice to you?"

**???:**
"I'm not sure. The Lord's messages are a complicated matter, and at times incomprehensible to someone as irrelevant as I, or it could be that I——"

**???:**
"That's enough, Pope. Any further will only lead to unrest and blasphemy."

**???:**
"Well, how rude. I am a very well-informed person."

**???:**
"Really..."

**???:**
"Now then. I will head out to see it as always."

**???:**
"Ah, by all means. I will need to formulate a strategy with my men. It'll be a little bit late going over there."

**???:**
"Yup. Now... one more thing, if you don't mind."

**???:**
"Hm?"

(The pope walks up to the man and taps him. He looks worried now.)

**???:**
"Your schemes. Be sure not to overdo it, otherwise it'll ruin your looks."

(She leaves)

**???:**
"......She got me. So the title of Pope is not something that's just for show. But you know what? I still have a few more tricks up my sleeve."

![](https://i.imgur.com/r3FlL0g.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/nHOVWtx.png)

(Saber, Archer, Rider, Lancer, Caster, and Berserker appear)

**Class・Saber:**
"We are here, your majesty."

**???:**
"Right. First off, report."

**Class・Saber:**
"As you say. A medium-sized force from Vengeance has invaded three hours ago. They appeared to be moving to collapse Trigonion Fortress. The thirty Archers positioned earlier all used their Noble Phantasms and eliminated them.

**???:**
"Ah, so I was right."

**Class・Saber:**
"Yes. However, just before the retreat was ordered, ten servants  attempted to pursue and as a result were wiped out."

**???:**
"...I told them to stay on guard, not to pursue."

**Class・Saber:**
"Right. They were a force of Riders, Berserkers, Assassins who acted on their own accord. They were marching ahead, I would say. And then...

(Saber pulls Rider over)

**???:**
"Are you the servant who hastily ordered that march?"

**Class・Rider:**
"I, I... apologize..."

**???:**
"...Do you feel any remorse for what you have done?"

**Class・Rider:**
"Y-yes, I do...!"

**???:**
"Do you think you will be granted mercy?"

**Class・Rider:**
"That's... umm... that's..."

(The man smiles)

**???:**
"Heh. Sorry for threatening you. Making a successful march is part of a general's instinct. It's hard for a soldier to suppress that urge. You are forgiven, and for the rest of you guys, don't be too hard on them. Needless to say, you're all here because you want to prove yourselves. That is, even if you do succeed."

**Class・Saber:**
"Right!"

**???:**
"Very well, next."

**Class・Archer:**
"These two were having a quarrel."

(Saber and Berserker are shown briefly)

**???:**
"It's not good for fellow servants to fight amongst each other. Especially not in this realm. In other words, you two must be punished. In the next battle, I order both of you to the rearguard."

**Class・Archer:**
"There! The decision is made. Now don't tardy!"

(Saber and Berserker nod and slowly leave)

**Class・Caster:**
"Last up is me."

**???:**
"Oh? I didn't realize that an honor student such as yourself would have a flaw. For you who had marched alongside Alexander the Great, what did you do this time?"

**Class・Caster:**
"That's——"

(Caster whispers to the man. The man becomes upset and slashes Caster)

![](https://i.imgur.com/l3aon4j.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/x0hOC0z.png)

**Class・Caster:**
"Gaaah...!"

**???:**
"——No good. That's the only thing forbidden in this realm."

"We do not acknowledge Pan-Human History."
"We do not acknowledge anything other than rebellion."

"No cooperation, no mercy, absolutely none of those. I thought you understood those when you joined our side, but..."

**Class・Caster:**
"B-but.... we're...."

**???:**
"Correct, we're heroes. Beings who either resisted the flow of history, were swallowed up, or vanished. Our reasons for defending the Human Order have already disappeared. I——— can never forgive Pan-Human History. It's personal. This realm gathers people like us. It seems you were slightly twisted when you were summoned."

**Class・Caster:**
"You're the ones... who are twisted..."

**???:**
"——Probably. Even so, I cannot stop."

(The man digs his blade deeper into Caster. Caster then dissipates.)

**???:**
"..."
"... I will be heading off to worship. I wish to be alone now."

**Class・Saber:**
"As you command!"

(Inside a church chapel, the pope from earlier is here)

![](https://i.imgur.com/VZjB8QC.png)

**???:**
"I am, not wrong."
"I am, not mistaken."

Originally, the girl's prayers were not aimed towards herself, but for others. For something's sake, she prayed. For anyone's sake, she prayed. That is the correct course, for this is how she proves herself through devotion. 

However, this prayer was aimed towards herself. To make her sins not her sins, her atonement not her atonement. And yet, the contradiction is that only the fruits of her devotion are laid here. This contradiction is what drives her into an uncontrollable suffering.

**???:**
"I ask of you, to save me."

She was puzzled by a wish that she didn't know who to direct it towards.

(The man walks in)

**???:**
"I apologize for being late."

**???:**
"No, it is fine. I've just started praying."
"......"

**???:**
"What's wrong?"

**???:**
"It's nothing. Now, to continue, let us pray for your sake."

No matter how much blood is on his hands, may we shoulder a little of that sin. I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. Even so, I.

I can't think of anything else.

(In a different palace with a yellow hue.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/M1pCfbM.png)

**Class・Lancer:**
"That is all. Caster's analysis is that the battle between the two realms is in a stalemate."

**Astolfo:**
"Mmm, the skirmishes have stopped. As I thought, they're still very cautious of us. What about you, Roland?"

**Roland:**
"...Isn't it obvious? We may have the smallest force, but our soldiers and officers are by no means inferior. Put your all into it and you'll definitely reap the rewards."

**Class・Saber:**
"And most of all, this realm is where our great king, Karl the Great, resides."

**Class・Lancer:**
"Ooo! What can the likes of Kriemhild or Constantine do anyways!

**Class・Archer:**
"There is no true king other than Karl the Great!"

**Astolfo:**
"And that's what I'm told, Great One-sama!"

(Scene shifts to a silhouette of an king-like figure... who looks rather small)

![](https://i.imgur.com/bcEmAmM.png)

**???:**
"Uh huh."

(A female silhouette with animal ears also appears)

**???:**
"That revenge-driven queen and that emperor who failed to protect his country, they are no enemies to us. Thus speaks Karl the Great."

**Class・Saber:**
"Ooo, well said!"

**???:**
"Uh huh."

**???:**
"We should always move last, for a king must not act rashly. Assassins, keep up your efforts. Everyone, work hard on your training. These are the King's words.

**Class・Archer:**
"Yes, understood!"

![](https://i.imgur.com/0iuo20B.png)

**Astolfo:**
"Great One, Roland or I are ready for the next task."

**???:**
"Ah."

(The female whispers to the king)

**???:**
"I leave it to thee, Roland."

**Roland:**
"It is an honor, my lord. Well, I'm off now!"

**Astolfo:**
"Rolaaaand. Did you forget your sanity again?"

**Roland:**
"I'm not you so of course I won't forget!"

(Roland leaves, leaving Astolfo and the king and the woman remaining in the chambers)

**Astolfo:**
"Ahem. So, how did it go?"

**???:**
"We managed to make it through another day. Haah, what a sigh of relief. You also did your best, Danna(2)-sama."

(2) TL Note: Master

**???:**
"But all I said were 'Uh huh' and 'Ah'!"

**???:**
"That's fine. Sometimes a hundred words isn't any better than a single foolish one. To be honest, it's not good to talk, otherwise you'll go bal... it'll peel off your aura (kingly valor)." 

**???:**
"Hey, was that an indescribable insult directed towards my top-head?"

**Astolfo:**
"You're being pa-ra-no-id!"

**???:**
"Is that so..."

**???:**
"Well, leaving that aside, the scouts have been bickering a lot lately. As I thought, we can't hold onto this deception forever. The famous Karl the Great not showing up at all... being injured in some way, or occupied with more important matters. It's only natural to think like that."

**???:**
"But, if I am to go out like a bang..."

**???:**
"It is the quick and easy way to go."

**Astolfo:**
"Hahaha, you must be in trouble!"

**???:**
"This isn't a laughing matter."

**Astolfo:**
"Eh, really? In short, all you need is an event that doesn't raise suspicions on your King guise? Like say, something like a fourth force is coming?"

**???:**
"...!"

**Astolfo:**
"It's just my instincts acting in some way or another. The tides are about to turn, so let's prepare as many scouts and take advantage of this opportunity!"

**???:**
"If that's your intuition, then it sounds trustworthy enough... Very well, I will send the scouts out. It won't be just Assassins but also Riders and Casters as well. I will leave the defenses to the other classes. They can hold the area to some degree. I also wish you the best of luck."

**Astolfo:**
"Rooooger!"

(Astolfo leaves.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/bcEmAmM.png)

**???:**
"Danna-sama."

**???:**
"Uh huh."

**???:**
"I feel that you stand at a crossroads here. Please stay strong."

**???:**
"Ah, of course. Let us show them the power of Don... Karl the Great!"

**???:**
"You're already trending on thin ice with those words, Danna-sama. If we get caught, we'll be done for."

**???:**
"Eeek."

**???:**
"I ask of you to be meek, but also bold. Is that clear?"

**???:**
"Uh huh!"

**???:**
"Now then... the fourth force would obviously be that organization, right...? I wonder will happen next."

![](https://i.imgur.com/ycMurIP.png)

The scene then switches to the rayshift, but something has gone wrong, as if the rayshift itself is glitching. Nonetheless, Guda, Kadoc, Holmes, and Vlad III successfully land at a grassy area, but the rayshit question still remains. Communications with Chaldea are still retained via Mashu, and she also noticed the anomaly. Fortunately, Mashu confirms that everyone has safely arrived without any further issue. 

The group prepares to heads north, with Holmes acting as the rearguard while the Masters are in the middle. Suspicious noise is heard at first, but Holmes dismisses it and the group moves on.

Clear skies. The pleasant sound of the warm wind over the meadows. Everything is quiet. Peaceful. And that is why I cannot help but feel a frightening sense of foreboding approaching. It wasn't Guda, Kadoc, Vlad III, or Holmes who felt this premonition, but...

Back at the Storm Border, Da Vinci remains silent.

Still, it was only this girl who compelled them to investigate this singularity...

**--ARROW--**

![](https://i.imgur.com/nOtn9Oq.png)

The group reaches the village, only to find it destroyed. Vlad does not sense the presence of anyone in the village. Holmes requests Kadoc to analyze the ruins, which the latter agrees to despite it not being his specialty. While Kadoc gets to work, Holmes speculates that the rubble, and by extension the destroyed village, was the result of not human activity, but one of magecraft nature. 

Kadoc concludes that the entire area has been woven by magecraft, akin to a Caster's Territory Creation. An ordinary magus would have difficulty accomplishing this task, so a servant is likely the culprit. Holmes finds it strange that the town's architecture is from a time period between medieval and early modern Europe. He likens the situation to a picture set, where if there were faint traces of human activity, that activity would had taken some time to accomplish, whereas someone like a servant could do this in an instant.

**Vlad III raises his thoughts:** If the town was created not by a servant, but by someone close to that level, then who could had destroyed it? Holmes believes that it couldn't be a natural disaster, and there's no evidence of an animal rampage. Traces of arrow holes, swordfights, and wheel tracks indicate that there was a fight between servants.

As soon as Holmes says that, Mashu detects servant signatures and tells everyone to be on guard. She counts their numbers... only to be shocked and call Da Vinci to confirm if there was a mistake or something. Da Vinci tells Guda that an army of one hundred is attacking, all of them being servants. Everyone is shocked and Holmes asks for a re-confirmation, to which Da Vincis confirms that they are all servants and orders everyone to retreat and hide.

Mashu later notices another army of servants of similar number approaching. This town will soon become a battleground between the two servant armies, and there is no time to negotiate between either, so the best course of action is to hide. However, since Guda and Kadoc aren't servants, hiding their presence would be difficult, and staying as a group would quickly rat them out, so Holmes suggests that the Masters find a different place to hide while he and Vlad will find a different way to get through this ordeal. Vlad tells Guda to use a Command Seal if the situation worsens. Holmes wishes the Masters good luck as he goes to gather information on the servants.

Guda and Kadoc find a good hiding spot and dig a hole to hide in. Kadoc then uses a camouflage magecraft to hide their presence. Although he's unsure if it'll work against servants, it's better than nothing.

**Guda:**
"That's amazing..."

**Kadoc:**
"What do you mean amazing? This is just elementary magecraft."

Guda expresses interest in learning Magecraft from Kadoc, but Kadoc dismisses it saying that his magecraft is now outdated. The magecraft in question is anti-beast magecraft, designed strictly against beast foes. In ancient times, humanity had to fight not only themselves but also wild beasts capable of defeating ordinary humans, so anti-beast magecraft was created. In the modern era where wild beasts are no longer a commonplace, this magecraft has become obsolete.

**Guda:**
"Have you thought about quitting magecraft altogether?"

**Kadoc:**
"..."
"..."

"You caught me off with that question, but no. Now, let me tell you this. Any honest to proper magus would kill you for asking that question. Anyone would be offended if you told them 'Your life's worthless, so why don't you die?'"

**Guda:**
"I'm sorry..."

**Kadoc:**
"Well, it's not like I can do anything about it thanks to this collar... sorry, that was just a snide remark. I guess I'm bad at situations like this..."

The armies are getting closer, so Kadoc cuts the idle talk. All Guda and Kadoc can do is pray that they don't get caught.

A Vengeance Realm (Red) Saber reads off a report from scouts: They will be facing a mid-size enemy force. Vengeance's strategy is to have Archers fire off a simultaneous volley of Noble Phantasms while their Riders cover the ground. The Sabers and Lancers will then push through the middle and attack at the same time the Riders disorient the enemy. Their success depends on the timing of their Noble Phantasms.

**Kadoc:**
"Unbelieveable... they really are all servants..."

**Guda:**
"Their true names..."

**Kadoc:**
"We don't know, but they all come from different time periods and nationalities, and yet they're all one army... I can't believe it. Just what in the world is this singularity...? In the first place, even the Holy Grail has a limit to how many servants it can summon. Are they... stray servants?"

**Guda:**
"Are they a type without a Master?"

**Kadoc:**
"Yeah. You ran into a few of them in Singularities and Lostbelts. Exceptional servants tied to the land and the Holy Grail and summoned by them. This would be the case with Beowulf in the Russian Lostbelt. But, this amount of servants is abnormal. Taking the other side into account, there are two hundred servants here. We might be wiped out alongside this village...

**Guda:**
"So even this area is unsafe..."

**Kadoc:**
"We were supposed to escape from this soon-to-be battlefield, but at least they aren't coming to look for us. Well, let's see what happens next.

**Guda:**
"Aren't you getting a little desperate?"

**Kadoc:**
"I'm... not... I'll reflect on that."

The battle begins. Red Saber orders the Archer group forward. The Restoration (Blue) Realm Berserkers usher a warcry, leading Sabers, Lancers, and Riders into battle.

**Class・Saber:**
"Wait for it..."

**Class・Archer:**
"..." 

**Class・Saber:**
"Fire! Fill up your Command Seals and unleash Noble Phantasms! First off Phantasmal class, then Heroic Spirit class!"

**Class・Archer:**
"Command Seals to maximum, unleashing Noble Phantasms! 'Lightning Long Longbow (Armor-piercing Lightning)!'"

(The Archers fire their Noble Phantasms, only to be deflected.) 

**Class・Archer:**
"Wha-!"

(A Blue Berserker charges and cuts the Archer down.)

**Class・Saber:**
"Archers! Fall back to the rear! Hurry!"

(A Red Assassin appears to deliver a report.)

**Class・Assassin:**
"We have sustained minor losses!"

**Class・Saber:**
"Shit, they have Heroic-Spirit class Casters casting buffs...! This is it, hold your ground!"

(Back in the hole.)

**Guda:**
"Heroic-Spirit class?"

**Kadoc:**
"That's what they said. I'm also curious."

(Back to the battlefield.)

**Class・Saber:**
"Cast your buff here too!"

(A Red Caster buffs up Red Saber and Red Lancer. At that moment, a Blue Berserker and Rider smashes into them. Red Saber is sent flying back, but barely holds on.)

**Class・Saber:**
"Guh...! We can't... keep this... up...!"

**Class・Archer:**
"Fire! Fire! Fire! Buy some time!"

**Class・Lancer:**
"We're taking heavy damage!"

**Class・Saber:**
"Rider! Are you not here yet?"

(Communication sound)

**Class・Rider:**
"We are arriving at your coordinates. We will soon be in position toー What?!"

**Class・Saber:**
"What's wrong?"

**Class・Rider:**
"Assassins have ambushed our Right Wing! We need time to regroup!"

(Communication sound)

**Class・Rider:**
"This is Left Wing! A Caster's barrier is blocking us off! We also need time to... if we can't coordinate our attacks, then our effectiveness will be cut in half!"

**Class・Saber:**
"Damn it...! What must we do to get Kriemhild-sama to...!

(Back in the hole.)

**Kadoc:**
"Kriemhild..."

**Guda:**
"Kriemhild? That's..."
"Who?" &lt;---

**Kadoc:**
"I'll tell you later. Hm? The other side isn't moving?"

(Back in the battlefield, Red Assassin appears)

**Class・Assassin:**
"New report! There's chaos happening within the Restoration Realm's, Constantine's Army's ranks!

(In a different area, Roland steps forth and smiles)

![](https://i.imgur.com/3OLC4Ij.png)

**Roland:**
"Good, good, looking good. Now it's our time to shine and make it out with the spoils."

![](https://i.imgur.com/mDsLHmR.png)

**Royal Road (Yellow) Class・Archer:**
"If that's the case, shouldn't we wait a little longer? It would be better to snatch the opportunity the moment one of them gets wiped out..."

**Roland:**
"..."
"..."

"Ya, let's not do that! Either way it'll be a big bow to the Vengeance Realm. Just minimize the damage done to the Restoration Realm. Let's go!"

(In an open field stands a samurai-esque Blue Saber)

**Class・Saber:**
"...Good. We'll crush Kriemhild's army at this rate!"

**Class・Assassin:**
"...N-New report! The Royal Road Realm, Karl the Great's army, has made their move! They've broken through out backline, and thrown our rearguard into disarray!"

**Class・Saber:**
"Damn it, another one...?!"

**Class・Assassin:**
"The general is Roland! Roland from the Legends of Charlemagne! He's tearing our rearguard apart at breakneck speed!

**Class・Saber:**
"Retreat! Fall back to the Restoration Realm! We can't win against a pincer attack! Assassins, set up a smokescreen! Archers, provide covering fire!"

**Class・Archer:**
"Fire, fire, fire! Longbows, crossbows, cannons, fire whatever you can! Shoot everything you have!"

(Back in the ruined town.)

**Class・Saber:**
"Constantine is retreating! Good, let us fall back as well! Casters will wait until the Riders catch up! Change the terrain and cut off any pursuers!"

**Class・Caster:**
"Acknowledged."

(Rider appears)

**Class・Rider:**
"I'll leave things in your hands now!"

**Class・Caster:**
"... 'Change'"

(The ground cracks)
