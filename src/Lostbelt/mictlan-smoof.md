## Prologue

**Kadoc:**

>This is—-- What in the world is this place—--  
>  
>Looks like an operating room and a lifeform who seems to be dead…?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>…  
>  
>Situationally, this person—

**Kadoc:**

>Yea, this person was the one who was the Master of the Servant in the Singularity.  
>  
>Moriarty called it, “Specimen: E”.

**Mashu:**

>.! I apologize for being taken back by this. But I’ll start collecting surrounding data!

**Kadoc:**

>Go ahead. Please scan everything in this room. I’ll go ahead and look into any used spells or mana residuals as well.  
>  
>…That would be the best thing to do right now. But with all this modern equipment here, for mana to be here is—

**Guda:**

>Just now—  
>  
>Mashu, Kadoc, I have a bad feeling about this!

**Kadoc:**

>Stop yelling like that, freaks me out! But I’ve seen that look on your face many times!  
>  
>It means we’re in danger! Mashu, scan faster!

**Mashu:**

>Alright! I only have 10 seconds left to record and measure every bit of information in this room!

**Kadoc:**

>Alright, the door’s still open! Once Mashu is done scanning, we’re getting out of here!  
Fujimaru! You—---  
>  
>Why are you carrying the corpse!? Don’t touch shit if you don’t know what it is!

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>(...I mean, it looks scary…)  
>  
>But, leaving it here is a bit…  
>  
>Let’s put it outside at least…

Mashu is finished with her scan and everyone escapes along with the corpse. The bonds of matter in the space are becoming untangled and there’s a timespace disturbance with no passage before them. Mashu forcibly transports Fujimaru and Kadoc out of there.

Back at the ship, Goredolf does a check on the trio. The trio has gotten some rest and have begun taking preparations for the next Lostbelt. Goredolf congratulates you guys for annihilating Traum as it was safely extinguished. He also holds out hope that Sherlock Holmes will return. Nemo states that everyone such as Muniere, Sion and Da Vinci are working hard to analyze everything and report it soon. 

Currently, the Storm Border is hovering over North America and will take two days to arrive at the Amazon Rainforest in South America. Sion congratulates your return from Traum and advises that energy plays a big factor in summoning Servants. 

![](https://i.redd.it/6aw69f44p18a1.png)

Sion says to Kadoc that she was also convinced that Holmes was an Apostle of the “Foreign God”. There are two reasons why Sion believed this to be true. The first being the Sixth Singularity in which Sherlock Holmes got information by being in sync with TRI HERMES. A mere Heroic Spirit would have their Spirit Origin burst due to information overload. The second was that he stopped thinking about the “Foreign God’s” motive by becoming Chaldea’s ally.

Sion says that the “Foreign God” wanted him to cooperate with Chaldea. Sion assumed that his job was either “Cooperate up to Point A, but stop cooperating beyond Point B” or “If Chaldea has accomplished Point A, then annihilate Chaldea from the inside.”

![](https://i.redd.it/5bwx4cw5p18a1.png)

Nemo asks if Sherlock Holmes should’ve came back if he rebelled against the “Foreign God”, but that’s where the mystery lies and the hint on how to approach the essence of the “Foreign God” as Sion says that he didn’t choose self-destruction. Holmes left the stage because as long as he was the Management Advisor then, he’ll live and continue to follow the “Foreign God”.

![](https://i.redd.it/0d0lkjrbp18a1.png)

Da Vinci appears over the transmission and says that Specimen: E yielded bonus results for her. There was a Virus Data Bomb just hiding in that corner of space. If she opened it, then it’d explode, but Goredolf yells at her to stop, put the lid on and go outside. Moriarty interrupts the transmission.

![](https://i.redd.it/x3w78mjdp18a1.png)

**Moriarty:**

>Ah, test, test. Can you hear me? Is this even shooting properly?  
>  
>Oh. Alright, that’s a nice angle. Unfortunately, there’s no chairs around here, so I’ll have to just stand.  
>  
>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Or good evening. I am the evil genius, James Moriarty.  
>  
>By the time this file is opened, I would have already disappeared. Truly unfortunate.  
>  
>I prepared this just in case something happened, but this is a pre-recorded Moriarty video.  
>  
>Now. I know we’ve been through a lot, but let’s wash that away please.  
>  
>I wanted to save the world. It’s a heavy burden for Chaldea, no, for Fujimaru.  
>  
>I can effectively save the world.  
>  
>It’s because I have a lot of pride.  
>  
>This is not to alarm Master Fujimaru.  
>  
>Since I was too shy to directly tell you, I’ll tell you here and now.  
>  
>I do not acknowledge Fujimaru. I want you to never be mistaken about that.

Mashu:

>I apologize. May I delete this video?

**Guda:**

>Hold on.  
>  
>Let’s hold on there.

![](https://i.redd.it/i5nen9ahp18a1.png)

**Moriarty:**

>You guys have gained information on “Specimen: E”.  
>  
>It’s Chaldea’s job to analyze what “Specimen: E” is…but that’s a bit of a service.  
>  
>That thing is not a lifeform of Earth.  
>  
>It is the remains of a lifeform that has been concealed, surveyed and experimented on in that facility for about 100 years.  
>  
>In its final moments, it screamed out to its brethren, but it seems it called out to the “Foreign God”...  
>  
>I wasn’t able to find anything out other than that. But that’s because I missed the readings I needed.  
>  
>TRISMEGISTUS II in the Storm Border should be able to reach those answers.  
>  
>Now then, farewell, Chaldea. I pray that you guys discover the answers…well, I won’t pray for that.  
>  
>Miracles are always bound to happen. Praying to god is something that students do when they’ve forgotten their homework.

**Kadoc:**

>That bastard, is he trying to be sarcastic!?

**Mashu:**

>He’s a horrible professor…! He’s a bad influence on Master’s personality!

![](https://i.redd.it/jpx9n77kp18a1.png)

**Moriarty:**

>Are Kadoc Zemlupus’s and Mashu Kyrielight’s reactions over?  
>  
>Ah, ahem. Let me do you another service.  
>  
>With all this good will…or well, disservice I’ve done, I’m at risk of never being summoned at Chaldea in the future.  
>  
>Let me be clear, you guys don’t have a lot of time.  
>  
>With U-Olga Marie appearing as the “Foreign God”, she plans to further strengthen her Saint Graph.  
>  
>There is an “Existence Outside the Domain” that slumbers within South America. This absolute taboo is classified only to the “Department of Lore” within the Mage Association.  
>  
>It is a genuine invader (invasive lifeform) on this planet—  
>  
>This cosmic being is named “ORT”. Her current goal is to fuse with it.  
>  
>Hahaha, are you shocked? Surprised? If so, then that is delightful.  
>  
>The time limit draws near. You have no time to rest after defeating me.  
>  
>Once the “Foreign God” gets her hands on ORT, we lose.  
>  
>You better hurry. Or else, this planet will split in two with all this evil potential it has.

![](https://i.redd.it/zfobn1dmp18a1.png)

Goredolf is shocked by the name ORT while you’re oblivious to that name. Goredolf rephrases a nasty quote about ORT and envies you for not hearing that name even once.

![](https://i.redd.it/himxausnp18a1.png)

**Kadoc:**

>ORT, huh, well…  
>  
>In words you’ll understand, it’s a horror story that spreads around within the mage world.  
>  
>They say that “before the Common Era, it was a comic lifeform that landed in South America and anyone who would get close to it would be killed”.  
>  
>There wasn’t a single living mage who’d return after stepping into its domain.  
>  
>Regardless, whether it was considered too dangerous to leave alone or for scientific interest…  
>  
>In the 16th century, a long awaited Grand-ranked mage embarked to South America with 6 fellow Brand-ranked mages.  
>  
>It’s the highest rank that a mage can ever achieve in the mage world. A monster able to tackle a country alone.  
>  
>A rank below that would be the Brand mages who are jewel-like prodigies with abilities that rival a Grand’s.  
>  
>Seven of them collectively venturing is a never before seen event.  
>  
>In actuality, it seemed that there was a festive mood in the exploration logs of the campsite they made in the deep forest.  
>  
>However…only one mage came back from that exploration.  
>  
>“That thing can never be touched. No human on this Earth can do it”.  
>  
>“Wait for the next period. We will place our hope onto new evolved lifeforms who’ll come after our extinction.”  
>  
>While he was talking, he became a living crystal before the public’s eyes.  
>  
>The mage’s name was Astea. One of the twelve lords of the Clock Tower at the time.  
>  
>After the incident, the institutional head (the top) of the Mage Association and Clock Tower announced that this lifeform be named “ORT”.  
>  
>Henceforth, South America came to be well known as an demon-infested area that humanity should never walk into.  
>  
>For mage families who were on the edge like mine, it was a questionable fairytale.  
>  
>Look at Goredolf, nobles were told this as if it were a fact.  
>  
>Parents would terrify their misbehaving child with “ORT is coming for you”.

Goredolf tells you that if ORT started moving, it’d crush the Earth in seconds as he was told. Nemo confesses that it appeals to his sense of adventure and Goredolf warns him about that attitude.

![](https://i.redd.it/81wnnk9qp18a1.png)

**Mashu:**

>I remembered something. There was a description of “ORT” in Chaldea’s library.  
>  
>Currently, “ORT” is affirmed to be the strongest and mysterious lifeform in the mage world.  
>  
>It is a tremendous spider-shaped cosmic lifeform that possesses a hard, soft, hot and cold exterior with an energy generation that’s a nuclear fusion reaction in its interior, and touching it would turn you into a crystallized substance.  
>  
>We can only hope that humanity’s technology will advance so that we can analyze it in 3000 A.D. It is truly a “Threat to Humanity”.

Sion is confused and ponders why the “Foreign God” would even fuse with ORT when she’s already strong enough as is. Nemo proposes that as an acclaimed President of the Earth, she’ll become possessive of the things that reside here. Sion gives an example of Chaldea being level 50 and the “Foreign God” at level 1000, with the fusion with ORT, she’d be at level 10,000.

Sion proposes to everyone in Chaldea and in the Storm Border that they’ll have to work on confirming if she can actually fuse with anyone. If she can, then everything they’ve worked on since Lostbelt 6 will be worthless.

**Sion:**

>The Storm Border will depart for the Seventh Lostbelt as it finalizes adjusting its equipment.  
>  
>Let’s find the “Foreign God” and crush her before she can fuse with “ORT”!

In the medical room, Da Vinci and Mashu talk about the condition of Ortenaus. Both seem pretty relieved that there’s no complications with it. Mashu seems to have an easier time with it and with Black Barrel. However, while Mashu is growing stronger and almost equivalent to a Top Servant, Da Vinci places a restriction on Black Barrel. The main usage for it now is “Bombardment via Mana Compression”. The calculation of Life Scale using Accomplish Measure, the formation of the Black Barrel and the creation of Dead Counter are forbidden because it puts too much strain on both the user and the Master. As well as the ban on using it in urban areas since it’ll potentially harm civilians and the effects are wide. This much was relayed to Fujimaru Ritsuka.

![](https://i.redd.it/qt8uvihbc48a1.png)

Da Vinci informs Mashu that the Black Barrel weaponizes the “Concept of Death” and the Atlas Institute deems it a hazard. Regular Servants as they materialize are created via Ether since they can’t grow any stronger than what they were when they’re recorded in the Throne of Heroes. With the concept of a Demi-Servant, Mashu’s Saint Graph is growing due to her physical and mental growth.

The problem here is that Mashu is being more Heroic Spirit-like as she continues to live out her days. Da Vinci lectures her by telling her that Servants are “Ghost Liner: Boundary Record Belts”. The more power Mashu seeks, the more she’ll stop being “Demi”. Da Vinci tells Mashu that if she feels bad about something, she can take off Ortenaus and head back to the Border since she has companions at Novum Chaldea. Da Vinci also mentions that Fujimaru or her have given up on Olga Marie.

![](https://i.redd.it/jink2ugcc48a1.png)

**Nemo:**

>The ship will soon be passing through Central America! We’ll be going from Mexico to Guatemala without any enemy interference!  
>  
>As we travel beyond the Bleached Earth, we’ll approach South America’s “Storm Wall”! Operation commences in approximately 20 minutes!

**Goredolf:**

>A-alright! Novum Chaldea, everyone station yourselves!  
>  
>While we are carrying out this operation urgently, preparations have been completed beforehand.  
>  
>So there’s nothing to be worried about! Right, Technical Advisor!?

**Da Vinci:**

>Of course. We have our ace against the “Foreign God”.  
>  
>A sacred sword that’s augmented with the concept of a sacred sword—  
>  
>It’s shown to have a 99.99% success rate. So there won’t be any problems with it in battle including the transformation sequence.

Goredolf is amazed and curious about this. He assumes that it’ll be an artillery weapon that’ll be fired once the transformation sequence is completed. Muniere tells Goredolf that the Marines will be the one firing it. Sion digresses and asks Goredolf if he wants to hear about the analysis of Specimen: E.

![](https://i.redd.it/dglz4c2gc48a1.png)

**Sion:**

>1. The operating room is on the same level of our civilization. It’s all state of the art equipment.  
>  
>2. “Specimen: E” is an unknown lifeform. TRISMEGISTUS II has no corresponding data regarding it.  
>  
>3. There was a large amount of blood and cells detected in the room, but was wiped clean. This was from a human.

Analysis is far from done, Sion says. But for now she has stopped TRISMEGISTUS II’s analysis to focus on this mission. You ask if a murder occurred due to Point #3. Sion replies that you have a keen eye, but answers that assuming that it was self-inflicted harm, then yes, a murder did happen.

Mashu asks if the blood was the result of some kind of operation from the operating table. Sion replies that it is half possible. The reason why it’s not fully possible is that blood would never travel far or even 1 meter from the operating table. Nemo interrupts them by announcing that they’re approaching their destination.

![](https://i.redd.it/k8l65b0jc48a1.png)

**Professor Nemo:**

>TRISMEGISTUS II has recommended that 4 Servants be summoned for this mission\~.  
>  
>Normally you would use your energy to summon after you’ve landed in the Lostbelt, but Britain set a precedent for us.  
>  
>The first Servant who’s been summoned is headed towards the Control Room.  
>  
>The other three Servants will join you momentarily.

Goredolf says that what Professor Nemo said is right. Summoning in a Lostbelt is not ideal anymore. He goes on about how South America is an cruel land, therefore the Servant has to be strong, cruel, uncivilized and gorilla-like who acts monkey-like.

![](https://i.redd.it/r8lbquyjc48a1.png)

**Nitocris:**

>Who are you calling an ape! That’s disrespectful, Commander of Chaldea!

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Nitocris!  
>  
>A Medjed looking person!

**Nitocris:**

>Indeed. You look well, Fujimaru Ritsuka. As you can see, I’ve responded to your wish for assistance.

Nitocris states that she is summoned from Chaldea’s record of Nitocris’s Saint Graph. While she’ll know what Chaldea has experienced with her, for Nitocris, this is her first time meeting them. 

![](https://i.redd.it/e751dvl2d48a1.png)

She introduces herself as Nitocris, the sky god personification and user of the Underworld Mirror. Mashu notices something different about Nitocris. Nitocris responds that she’s in her “ideal state” with all the mana supply she’s getting from the Storm Border. She also has Independent Action attached to her as well.

Kadoc is surprised that she’s able to act like this and agree to helping Chaldea which makes him assume that she has a lot of faith in Fujimaru. He’s also surprised that she can be this effective with the mana supply she’s been given.

**Da Vinci:**

>Nitocris will be acting as Master’s bodyguard…well, we’re entrusting you to be the bodyguard of the on-field team.  
>  
>We expect you to do a lot of walking and exploring in South America. We’ll also need someone who’s adaptable, suitable in group fights and uses magecraft that’s resistant to fever and impurity.

**Habetrot:**

>Hmm. Seems like I’ll be playing bodyguard, huh. That being the case, I’ll introduce myself.  
>  
>Alright! I’m Habetrot! I’m sort of like the guardian faerie that dwells in Mashu’s shield.

![](https://i.redd.it/7901biioc48a1.png)

Goredolf is pleased that the number of Servants that are able to help us and raises morale by encouraging everyone to find the Fantasy Tree and chop it down. However, Sion and Goredolf mention that there’s no Fantasy Tree to be detected in the Lostbelt, but there should be a Fantasy Tree equivalent there or a conditional Fantasy Tree (LB6 (withered Tree) and LB3 (concealed Tree)). However, neutralizing the “Foreign God” is top priority.

**Nemo:**

>The bow will now commence a dimensional punch! From here on out, operation, defeat the “Foreign God”, commences!

You punched through the Lostbelt Storm Wall, Nemo asks for a visual on how the state of the Seventh Lostbelt looks and everyone is shocked.

![](https://i.redd.it/ismy2pt6d48a1.png)

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>It’s nothing but a…wasteland here.

**Goredolf:**

>What is this, hell–!? Isn’t this supposed to be South America, the Amazon Rainforest!?  
>  
>This is a desiccated land! Heavy thunderclouds! No plants or animals to be seen! Constant rain of volcanic ash!  
>  
>The Amazon jungle is supposed to be known as the “lungs of the Earth”, but not even a human can exist here!   
>  
>It’s like a “volcanic winter” here! Even Lostbelts draw a line somewhere!

**Sion:**

>Mr. Goredolf is right. I can’t even call this Biosphere 1.  
>  
>Lostbelts are “discontinued human histories” and this is too deviated.  
>  
>What was the cause of this…no, I wonder what the circumstances were for the environment to become like this…

**Nemo Professor:**

>Yes, it's surprising. I apologize, but can I have a moment please?  
>  
>I’ve finished scanning the surface, let me transmit it. Ms. Sion, tell me your opinion.

![](https://i.redd.it/zlr2qae8d48a1.png)

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>What…is this?  
>  
>(---I know it. This is—)

**Goredolf:**

>Hm? What is this? I’m sure I know this from somewhere.  
>  
>Zemlupus. Do you know this?

**Kadoc:**

>…Y-yea.  
>  
>It’s, y’know, that. It’s that. Hey, Kyrielight, say it.

**Mashu:**

>This is…possibly Pangea? But I’m not certain it is…

**Sion:**

>No, you’re right. This is undoubtedly the super continent, Pangea.

![](https://i.redd.it/b5qdb05bd48a1.png)

Muniere tells Goredolf that this is not about pancakes and about the supercontinent that predated the continents we have now. The continents we have now are due to crustal movements within the Earth.

![](https://i.redd.it/p7ttyfhdd48a1.png)

Goredolf says that we’re in 2017, but asks why we’re seeing a supercontinent here. Da Vinci’s impression are that this isn’t exactly Pangea since these are unsustainable conditions for humans to live in, but before Da Vinci could elaborate on an extinction event, Fou jumps at the sense that someone is coming with the alarms going off. The one who’s approaching us is U-Olga Marie.

![](https://i.redd.it/nwpwf7ved48a1.png)

**U-Olga Marie:**

>…To think something happened, but it’s you people. Aren’t you all foolish for coming here?  
>  
>Hmm. Perhaps you’ve gone with the momentum and arrived to cut off the seventh Fantasy Tree, but that was truly foolish.  
>  
>Do you have any idea where you are? This is the Lostbelt I selected for my homestay.  
>  
>I can instantly detect any irregularities. As the ruler of Earth, do you think I’d let you trespass on this land?  
>  
>I should’ve formed a gravitational field from the start so that pitiful vehicle could be pulverized…  
>  
>Rejoice. I’m in a very good mood! Grand Servants, was it? The apexes of humanity, decisive magecraft, I have dealt with all 7 Servants in one go.  
>  
>That’s right, I shall give you people a chance!  
>  
>I will lecture you by proving that I am worthy of governing this planet since you won’t take my speech as the truth.  
>  
>Come out and face me, humans!  
>  
>This will be the last, so I shall do what you people consider, savoring this battle.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>— (Shocked)

>Already off the bat!?

**Goredolf:**

>Urgghhhhh! This is too sudden, I can’t think!  
>  
>But that damn “Foreign God” is acting like some exchange student on Earth! I don’t get her at all!  
>  
>But it is clear that this is our only chance! She’s going to get cocky and doing that destructive attack…

>But she doesn’t intend to utilize that pseudo-black hole! Fool!

>In that case! Let’s give it to her and fight with our Servants!

>Of course! Hume Barrel is ready to go into firing sequence!

**Goredolf:**

>Alright! Operation start! Our enemy is the “Foreign God”, U-Olga Marie!

Mashu deploys “Mold Camelot” and repels it like a tennis ball while U-Olga Marie complements her by telling her that she’s a tennis Heroic Spirit, but Mashu rejects that. With enough time bought, the team is now ready to deploy the holy sword essence incorporated into the Storm Border.

Professor Nemo states that while the Black Barrel measures the lifespan of a target and converts that into weaponized energy, the holy sword essence measures the threat to humanity but instead of weaponized energy, it’s defensive and does the same thing as the Black Barrel. Now that’s left is to fire it. Captain Nemo fires the Hume Barrel.

Nemo Marine announces that U-Olga Marie seems to have absorbed it and somehow powered up. This leaves everyone panicked and Goredolf tells the team that even she’s shocked by how she managed to survive. Goredolf assumes that she’ll pull out another gravitational field. Da Vinci and Nemo scramble to produce a second shot. But as Da Vinci is suggesting to switch from a photon reaction shot to an armor piercing shot, Nemo Marine announces something.

**Nemo Marine A:**

>Wait, wait, we have confirmation of an abnormality on the surface! It’s a massive crustal collapseee!

**Nemo Marine B:**

>We have confirmation of an enormous cavern under the supercontinent! Woah, how many kilometers deep does this go!?

Muniere reports that the pillar and the “Foreign God” are fighting against each other. Nemo commands Mashu to retreat back to Hatch 1 of where the Shadow Border resides.

**Nemo:**

>That includes you guys, Fujimaru Ritsuka, Kadoc and Muniere!  
>  
>Other Chaldea staff should run towards the Shadow Border hanger as well!

Nemo and Sion have to stay for Nemo to stay manifested and Nemo commands Da Vinci to get to the hanger as well. Goredolf is the only human left that resides on the front of the ship, but Nitocris tells him that he is under Nitocris’s protection. Kadoc tells you that Nemo will have more freedom once we meet up with Mashu, but Nemo still gives you one of the Marines if you need anything.

**Muniere:**

>Woah, what’s with this sound and heat! Don’t you think it’s crazy out there!?

**Kadoc:**

>Stop looking and run!  
>  
>When Nemo said get to the hanger, he meant get on the Shadow Border!

>Nemo concluded that this ship is in danger of crashing! Right, Fujimaru!?

**Fujimaru:**

>Yea, that’s right.

>Eh?

**Nemo Marine:**

>Eh, reallyyyy!? Captain, that’s too cold-blooded of youuuu!

>You never mentioned we had to do thisss! All we had to do was transport materials, clean up and reportttt!

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>—Ah.

**Kadoc:**

>Wait, hey–

**Muniere:**

>You’ve got to be kidding me.

**Nemo Marine:**

>The lives of the staff comes first. After landing, I pray for the safety of all and godspeed.

**Man:**

>Hm…? Oh, a newcomer, huh. You’re awfully lightly dressed…but what era did you come from?  
>  
>Whatever, the fact that **you’re here** means that you’re an ally. Sit. Aren’t you tired?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Ah, alright. Pardon me.  
>  
>…(Cautious).

If you choose choice 1, the man asks you if you’re used to seeing people on the go. Choice 2, the man reassures you that you don’t need to be so tense since nobody will hurt you nor is he going to force you to sit down.

**Man:**

>Oh, don’t bother telling me your name. That’s not necessary here.  
>  
>A handshake is plenty for an introduction. Isn’t that the trend nowadays?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>…A handshake is a bit…  
>  
>“A mage never reveals his hand that quickly”

**Man:**

>I see. That’s a shame. I always wanted to see something like “a warrior’s unscathed hand”.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>That’s…  
>  
>The Storm Border…!

![](https://i.redd.it/u24jioem668a1.png)

**Man:**

>That’s a pretty good weapon. Is that something of your people?  
>  
>I’m a fan of modern weapons. They’re troublesome, hideous and very expensive.  
>  
>I welcome them. Just how one’s life grows, so should the tools of war.  
>  
>But the way you use it leaves a bad impression on me. Have you fought a battle worthy of that weapon?  
>  
>The fights you enjoy the most are the fights I despise with a passion.  
>  
>The purpose of fighting. The spirit to go onto the battlefield. While I’ll acknowledge that they’ve kept up with the appearance, I don’t like the principle of battle.  
>  
>**A battle without any deaths**? The hell’s that.  
>  
>The number of casualties on both the enemy’s and ally’s side should be equal.  
>  
>A battle without any deaths is an unacceptable battle.  
>  
>Remember this. Just because you people went this long without any deaths doesn’t mean your guys’ battles were great.  
>  
>You all just happened to be lucky. And now that luck will balance out.  
>  
>The first being that soaring ship in the sky. No one in there will make it out alive.  
>  
>There were no warriors there to begin with. They won’t even come here after death either.  
>  
>…Hmm. Wait, that means, then does that mean I acknowledge you as a warrior?  
>  
>…I’ll never know what Blue’s thinking^(\[1\]). Whatever. Then it’s just a usual “fluke”.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>—No one will be saved—  
>  
>—I have to save them…!

**Man:**

>You’re a restless fellow. You’ll never reach that ship. In any case, they’re still alive.  
>  
>They’re still in the middle of falling…above “the Silent Ilhuicatl”.  
>  
>**Dying** means that you’re in a different world. Even then, do you still want to go there? Even if it’s in vain?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>—Yes. Even if it is in vain.

![](https://i.redd.it/pu1w2d1r668a1.png)

**Man:**

>I see. I’m getting more of a bad impression of you, but since we met, I’ll lead you there.  
>  
>But I’ll show you the way in exchange for some weapons.  
>  
>As you can tell, I’m a modernist. I’m especially addicted to small 21st century weapons.  
>  
>So? What will you offer to save your dying friends? Do you have any weapons of any worth?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>…I don’t have a weapon on me.

**Man:**

>Well, that’s a shame. You can’t go back **there** then. You’ll be here like a dead man and—

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>But, there is something I consider a weapon—-

**Man:**

>.! Well, I’ll be damned. Foolish judgment that doubts the eye, decisiveness that captivates the eye!  
>  
>Very well. I have no use for them, but I can tell that they’re your greatest weapon.  
>  
>I’ll accept it. I shall thrust aside the fate of death from you.  
>  
>Step back from the fire. I’ll quickly **get you back there**.  
>  
>Hm? What is it? You don’t have to thank me with a tearful face.  
>  
>This was a full-fledged business transaction after all. Ah, there’s just one more thing. Hold on.  
>  
>This weapon was worth more than your life, and the decision you made was worth even more than that.  
>  
>Meaning, this is not enough to “bring you back”. Here’s the change. Is this good enough for you?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>This is…?

>Thank you…very much?

**Man:**

>Calaveras de Azúcar (Skull candy). It’s a luxury candy for those who enjoy it.

>It’ll come in handy if you hold onto it. —See ya.

The Man hits you and you begin to fall through the sky and you wake up in a cave with Nemo Marine. Nemo Marine is relieved to see you alive and describes how when part of the Storm Border got hit causing you to fall out, Nemo Marine came out and hugged you till you reached the floor and somehow ended up in a cave.

You ask why Nemo Marine is whispering. Nemo Marine responds to look over there.

![](https://i.redd.it/uhm8oknn768a1.png)

U-Olga Marie sleeps but is suddenly awakened by your voice. She calls you and Nemo Marine, harmless protists and claims how she is the highest lifeform and has come to be the ruler of this planet. U-Olga Marie does not know who she is and how she’s talking to you and Nemo Marine in this cave.

![](https://i.redd.it/lmcpj8eq768a1.png)

Amnesia. That is what you and Nemo Marine have deduced her condition to be. All she remembers is her name, purpose and the life-threatening attack she took recently.

![](https://i.redd.it/0ou16c2t768a1.png)

**U-Olga Marie:**

>That’s right! You’re pretty honest, earthling! I’ll hire you as my secretary!

U-Olga Marie made “this vessel” in order to travel spacetime. She asks for Nemo Marine’s name and Marine states that Marine is Nemo Marine No. 4 and exclaims repeatedly not to be killed. If you introduce yourself, U-Olga Marie will have a sensation of wanting to punch you in the face after hearing your name. Otherwise, if you exclaim not to be killed, she’ll figure out that your guys’ objective is stay alive.

![](https://i.redd.it/9y7jebpu768a1.png)

**U-Olga Marie:**

>Well, since we met like this, we’re now friends. Reluctantly.  
>  
>I’m disappointed that my first two friends on Earth are lackluster, but it’s important to cherish your first contact.  
>  
>Compromise is the first step of negotiations after all.  
>  
>Now then, alright, give me a tour of the Earth!  
>  
>Fujimaru! Marine! I shall appoint you two as my interstellar friendship ambassadors!

**Nemo Marine:**

>What do we do, Fujimaru\~\~! I don't know what this ruler is talking about\~\~! (Crying)

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>I am…an interstellar friendship ambassador…!  
>  
>I’m finally climbing up the ladder.

**U-Olga Marie:**

>Ah, I get it, I get it, you don’t have to say it. Thank me later.  
>  
>I’m also sensing a “distress” state from your guys’ mental wavelength.  
>  
>I came here to rule this planet after all, so I won’t overlook a troubled lifeform.  
>  
>Now, let’s head outside together. The exit is probably this way.

**Nemo Marine:**

>Now we’re in a lot of trouble! We’ll be killed if we don’t listen to her, right!?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Sure, but there’s no proof she'd do that…  
>  
>I don’t think that’s the case this time?

**Nemo Marine:**

>? Really?
