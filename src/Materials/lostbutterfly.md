# Fate/stay night - Heaven's Feel II lost butterfly Animation Material

## Introduction

---

Fate/stay night (Heaven's Feel) II. lost butterfly was released in theaters all over Japan on January 12, 2019. Fate/stay night, thevisual novel released by TYPE-MOON in 2004, is celebrating its 15th anniversary this year. In the year that it celebrates a milestone, the curtains rose on the second chapter of the original game's final route [Heaven's Feel]. Animation production was headed by the animation studio ufotable, which has worked on anime versions of TYPE-MOON titles for over 10 years, starting with the seven-part theatrical release the Garden of sinners. Tomonori Sudo, who continues hisrole as director from Chapter 1, has been a fan of TYPE-MOON works from even before Fate/stay night, and he is a creator who served as a character designer and chief animation director for the Garden of sinners. Sudo tagged this chapter as "the tale of a boy and a girl", and created the latest theatrical piece for the animation of Fate/stay night, the root of the Fate series. This is a story of "Choice" that Shirou Emiya and Sakura Matou make in this chapter.

**Theme 1**

### Adapting the original game into theatrical animation

--- 

**Q:** Today, we'd like to review Fate/stay night [Heaven's Feel] the movie (hereafter: [HF]) in the first interview with both Director Tomonori Sudo and the original character designer, Mr. Takashi Takeuchi. First, Mr. Takeuchi, please let us know your thoughts after watching II. lost butterfly.

**Takeuchi:** I felt like I was shown something that was simply amazing. My
impression particular to Chapter 2 was that as someone who was involved in creating the original game, it made me feel honestly proud that "we created this 15 years ago".

**Sudo:** I bought Fate/stay night on the release date 15 years ago as a game player. But the Fate series is still ongoing, and nowadays it is accepted by fans of a generation that is a lot younger than myself back then. What do I need to do to deliver [HF] to those people? I thought about all sorts of things while progressing through the movie production.

**Takeuchi:** From the visuals that I saw, I could feel the fact that Mr. Sudo really put deep thought into this. If you don't put deep thoughts into the details, you can't create something like this version of Chapter 2. I was overwhelmed by the amount of information and the caliber of quality, and it wasn't just that what was written in the original game was being animated. I had the feeling that I was meeting [HF] anew as "Director Sudo's film piece" which encased everything Mr. Sudo wanted to do.

**Sudo:** I guess a good way to put it would be to adapt the original game into an anime. The original game has ways to express things that are specific to games, so I felt like I wanted to convey the very nature that is encased in the game, and not just convert the text and still images. What I depended on in doing so was the feeling I felt when I was playing Fate/stay night. I thought that nature could not be omitted during the process of creating [HF] as a theatrical piece.

**Q:** Mr. Takeuchi, what point left a lasting impression when you watched Chapter 2?

**Takeuchi:** I didn't look at the script or the storyboards before watching the completed footage. Those are parts that (Kinoko) Nasu (original story writer) oversees, so I was able to enjoy the film as one fan. What surprised me in Chapter 2 was Sakura's "the tummy
started to rumble-grumble" scene. That scene is extremely scary in the original game. I myself had a very downerimage where Sakura is giggling in the darkness. However, Mr. Sudo took that in a completely different direction. By taking the approach of drawing Sakura as a
young girl, he took the cruelty and acridity and wrapped it with a thin membrane, yet kept it so that you could see the contents through the membrane. He properly drew out the true nature of the scene, but I feel he stood firm with the stance of Sakura as the heroine. At first, when I saw the settings for Sakura's dress that Mr. Sudo drew, I noticed that the dress was designed for a slightly younger age group so I thought it would be better if she wore something slightly more mature. However, when I asked Mr. Sudo, "Did you make her look young on purpose?" he answered "It's on purpose." And when I saw it in the theater, I was satisfied, thinking "Oh, I see, so this is what he was after." I believe that the general direction that this movie took could only be handled by Mr. Sudo.

**Theme 2**

### Fate/stay night the original game that attempted to cram in everything about Kinoko Nasu

---

**Q:** Mr. Takeuchi, what kind of emotions went into the original game when you created it 15 years ago?

**Takeuchi:** Back then, I felt that I "wanted to cram everything about Kinoko Nasu" into Fate/stay night just like we did in the previous title Tsukihime. It would be wonderful if each route would be so interesting in different ways that it could be considered separate genres, and create something that encompasses all of the amusement that Nasu embodies. That's why I thought it would be great if [HF] ended up having a slightly different type of experience compared to the other routes. FATE (Saber route) has a root story that I wrote back in high school, and I put most of that straight into the route. It was a stereotypical boy-meets-girl, and I believe it left an impression that felt something strongly like that of a manga for boys. The following [Unlimited Blade Works] (Rin route, hereafter [UBW]) turned the action scenes into more of group performances, but still weighed heavily on the action. And we wanted the final route [Heaven's Fool] (Sakura route) to be a romantic mystery. Some of Nasu's works include horror tastes or strong mystery elements, such as the Garden of sinners. I was hoping that [HF] could incorporate the humid, dense elements of that nature. Though there is some overlap: when we were creating the game the assets were created with the Saber route first. During creation, I felt like "since I drew this far in this route, I have to go even further into a different realm in the next route". However, all of our customers would of course be entering the next route while having lingering thoughts of the previous route. Looking at the reactions back then, many people mentioned that "I wanted Fate/stay night to go to the end with a turn of events more akin to [UBW]," and that for the scenario of [HF] which had a different experience, it wasn't uncommon to hear that "it was different from what I had expected".

**Sudo:** I recollect taking quite a long time to finish every route by playing several hours a day. I enjoyed each route for quite some time, so when I finished [UBW] a big part of me felt happy like "There's yet another route!" and "I can continue to enjoy this!" I personally loved the drastically different feel [HF] had. I was originally a Tsukihime player, so that "feeling of romantic story" gave me joy. I enjoyed the feeling of not knowing what was going on. Also, I like turns of events where "you see a side of characters that you weren't able to see before", so the disclosure that Sakura (Matou) has a different side of her than the previously portrayed symbol of everyday life and the sight of Sakura agonizing together with the protagonist Shirou were very fun for me.

**Takeuchi:** Being on the creator's side.I felt like "you're really going this far?" when I was reading the text that Nasu had written. However, I feel that the customers were split between those that enjoyed the change, and those that were surprised by it. Back then,
there's no doubt that there was at least a small sense of frustration. [HF] was something that came out after a deep probing especially for Nasu, so such opinions from the customers seems to have been a catalyst to start thinking about various things.

**Q:** Mr. Takeuchi, what kind of effects did you feel concerning [HF]?

**Takeuchi:** I felt that if you just played [HF] until the very end, you could arrive at the grand finale of Fate/stay night as a whole. I had known about Fate/stay night from back in high school, so when we recreated it once again, I really felt deeply emotional that the goal Nasu arrived at truly was an amazing one.

**Theme 3**

### Miraculous conversion to anime by Director Sudo

---

**Q:** How did you feel when you were approached with animating [HF]?

**Takeuchi:** Of course, in the beginning, I couldn't think that [HF] was a route that was really suited for turning into a visual medium. I was worried about whether or not Sakura could be fully drawn out as a heroine in a medium of video that differs so greatly from a game. I was also worried that since [HF] is a route that only works by overturning [FATE] and [UBW], many people would not be able to accept a visualization thereof. Those were my first impressions. However, ufotable has built up experience with the Fate series with Fate/Zero and the [UBW] TV anime series, and we were able to have Mr. Sudo who shares my own feelings for [HF] stand up as the director. I now feel that is why the adaptation of [HF] into a visual medium miraculously came to life.

**Sudo:** I said that I wanted to be the director this time around because I simply didn't want to have any regrets. If so, I have to hold responsibility. There is a part of me that wants to tell myself back when I first volunteered how hard the process would be (laughs), but even if I knew about how hard it would be, I'm sure I still would have said that I would like to be director.

**Takeuchi:** What part was the most difficult in creating it as a visual medium?

**Sudo:** One big point was to select the various elements of [HF] so that it would fit it in the timeframe of a movie (runtime). [HF] is the most text-heavy route within Fate/stay night, and if I recall correctly I played it for over 20 hours. How do I need to structure it
so all of that can fit into "2 hours x 3 movies = 6 hours"? And how should the story flow for each chapter to be watched by patrons as two-hour movies? Keeping in mind what the main theme of the story was, I gradually examined each element.

**Theme 4**

### The one and only place for Sakura to go

---

**Q:** During production of [HF], there was an exchange of ideas between Director Sudo and Mr. Takeuchi about character designs, right?

**Sudo:** Right. There were times when we followed the typical workflow where I created settings for character designs and had those corrected by Mr. Takeuchi. This time around, there also were times where Mr. Takeuchi would suggest ideas to me, saying "How about you use costumes like this?" For instance, Sakura's new costume in Chapter 1 was a suggestion from Mr. Takeuchi. Looks are very important in
a movie, so I was very thankful that we had a fresh look, where a Sakura who has never looked that way before shows up on the screen.

**Takeuchi:** Since we're making an anime adaptation after all, I felt I wanted to increase Sakura's charm as the heroine. And if that's the case, I thought why not change her costume. Other than that, I would receive rough character designs drawn by Mr. Sudo, and if something bothered me, I would retouch it just a bit. The only unexpected one was Ms. Batsu who showed up in Chapter 1. (laughs)

**Q:** What did you think of the Sakura drawn by Director Sudo?

**Takeuchi:** I had heard that Mr. Sudo was fond of Sakura, but I feel there is no better way to let a character shine than for the creator to pour his love into the character. Just by looking at how Sakura is drawn, the fact that Mr. Sudo wants to take Sakura and "try to draw her as the heroine" comes across. Back when I drew Sakura, there were times where I faltered on where exactly she stands. Saber and Rin, the heroines from the other routes, had places where they needed to be, and it was clear what they needed to do, so they were able to stand in the center of the picture. However, Sakura is always facing a different direction, and she felt like she didn't belong anywhere, that she was always looking at something distant. I agonized over where Sakura should belong when I was drawing the special illustration for the limited edition pressing for this Chapter 2 as well, but I was convinced during the drawing process that "Sakura is the one with no place she belongs to within a story with the Holy Grail War as the main focus". She finally gets a place to be when you draw Shirou close to her. I felt that my understanding of Sakura became one step deeper as a result of this anime adaptation.

**Sudo:** In the first key visual for Chapter 1, I had a picture where Sakura was alone. When I did, I felt like it naturally turned into "a picture of Sakura by herself, quietly staring this way"...

**Takeuchi:** Mr. Sudo, you drew a close- up illustration of Sakura for the cover of the November 2017 issue of Monthly Newtype. When I saw that, I felt that you only realize Sakura's charm when she is all by herself.

**Sudo:** She is a flower that doesn't stand out in a bouquet. But, if you just have that one flower, it's very beautiful, very pretty, and you just want to look at it. Saber and Rin each have ways that they glimmer, but Sakura has a twinkle that the viewer actively wants to seek out. I've drawn Sakura many times now, but I don't think any of them end up being the same Sakura.

**Theme 5**

### Director Sudo's pickiness that resonates with Kinoko

---

**Q:** Director Sudo, you have been facing Mr. Takeuchi's art (original character designs) as the character designer from back in the Garden of sinners movies. Please tell us your impression of Mr. Takeuchi's art.

**Sudo:** Mr. Takeuchi's art constantly changes with the times. And I have been chasing it for all this time, so I feel I want to incorporate those changes myself. Lately, how TYPE-MOON colors is being researched by our (ufotable's) staff. There is some trial and error to reproduce the atmosphere and ambience of the illustrations Mr. Takeuchi draws in that aspect as well.

**Takeuchi:** Thank you so much!

**Sudo:** The characters that Mr. Takeuchi draws have very clear silhouettes, so it helps out a lot when you try to move them in an anime. Each character's features are decipherable from the color and silhouette. For instance, Lancer in Fate/Zero had an impressionable silhouette with his hair being wavy like a fire. You can tell which character it is even if just a shadow, so I felt that was a great design. Also, the characters Mr. Takeuchi draws have a vast range of facial expressions. For Chapter 2, the images of Sakura's mirror image, Sakura trembling in fear, and Sakura after the darkening all may be facial expressions that are on the borderline of what cute girls shouldn't do, but Sakura was a character that had enough breadth that made you feel that it was still okay, In the cute scenes, Sakura's cuteness was properly drawn. Having the breadth of expressions like this is one of the fun parts of turning Mr. Takeuchi's characters into animation.

**Takeuchi:** The characters that Mr. Sudo draws are all very lively. Because he draws them with the breadth of expressions in mind, it feels as though the art is doing the acting. I feel that Mr. Sudo is someone who creates footage with his own sense of aesthetics as a director. In that aspect, his compatibility with Nasu is very good.

**Q:** Good compatibility?

**Takeuchi:** Work at TYPE-MOON consists of the tasks of putting images and sound to Kinoko Nasu's works. I believe that the core of Nasu pieces is logic and aesthetics, but the work of putting images to that is not simply the pursuit of reality, but the need to make big leaps based on reality. Where you need to leap depends on your sensibility, and I feel that whether or not you are seriously looking at the work and how well you resonate to Kinoko Nasu's sense of aesthetics are big factors. In Mr. Sudo's films, there is that feeling of resonance. So that's why I think they have good compatibility.

**Sudo:** It's hard to put aesthetics into words, but what I use as clues are the feelings I get when I play Mr. Nasu's works. The text and stage production from the original game are important, but I continued the production trying to remember as vividly as possible how I felt when I was playing the original game. I believe that what I feel now and what I felt back then are different. I am at a different age, and I am in a different environment. I take care in always thinking about what I need to do to portray the feelings I had back then for the people who are about to watch this piece, after thinking about where such changes emerged from. Even if I were to just lay out what I feel inside me as is, the viewers won't quite get it. If so, what kind of footage does it need to be? How should I go about the writing? Should I show Sakura's facial expression, or is it better to hide it? By plotting out each stage production like that, I feel it finally turns into something that can send a message to the audience.

**Takeuchi:** It's a sense of aestheticism. I feel that Nasu uses a great deal of passion to convey what he feels is "beautiful". He's been doing his best for all this time to relay "why you believe the lifestyle of a person named Shirou Emiya is beautiful". His stance to step up to what he feels is beautiful is astounding. I felt something similar to that stance of Nasu's.

**Q:** Director Sudo and ufotable will finally confront Chapter 3, the final chapter. If there is anything you're looking forward to, Mr. Takeuchi, please let us know.

**Takeuchi:** In the 15 years since the release of the original game, the Fate series has greatly expanded, and among all that I am very thankful that many people were accepting of the [HF] movies. Chapter 3 is really full of things to look forward to. The fiercest battle in all of Fate/stay night and the most beautiful scene are both in Chapter 3. I feel that the time has finally come to draw all of that out. As one viewer, and as one Fate fan, I am looking forward to the ending for Fate and beyond that Director Sudo and ufotable will draw.

**Theme 1**

### How each character exists as seen in Chapter 2

---

**Q:** Please tell us the impression you had on each of your characters after seeing the completed Fate/stay night [Heaven's Feel] II. lost butterfly.

**Sugiyama:** In this movie, the part where Shirou's objective changes and he chooses to not be the "hero of justice" who saves many people but a "hero of justice" who saves Sakura, a girl close to him, is finally drawn out. Shirou back in Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works] (hereafter [UBW]) tried to upkeep justice for the masses and at times stood up against Rin and Archer, but in this case where he chose to become "a hero of justice for only one person" it was impressionable that the two accepted it as "it's not impossible to understand".

**Ueda:** I feel that Rin in [UBW] was a character who was simply a girl 50% of the time, and was a Mage 50% of the time. But Rin in [HF] has a bigger side as a Mage, and it feels like she's an ordinary girl 10% of the time, and 10% of the time she has the face of a sibling. I felt that Rin in Chapter 2 was always drawn to be cool and powerful.

**Suwabe:** I feel that there isn't much change in Archer's basic stance among all three routes of Fate/stay night. What he says, what he does, and his ending - the impression is that the roots of what he is doesn't change greatly. So when I am acting as him, I don't really think about which route I am on. I always feel like I am portraying one "man". I need to express myself properly so that I can leave a scar in everyone's hearts after watching the movie... that feeling is strong each time I set foot into a recording.

**Theme 2**

### The bond between Rin Tohsaka and Archer

---

**Q:** We'd like to hear more from you as we go back through the impressionable scenes in Chapter 2. In the first half, there was a battle scene with Rin and Archer. What did you think of the scene fighting against Shinji Matou and Rider in the library?

**Ueda:** Especially because it's drawn from Sakura's viewpoint this time, Rin is accentuated as a "hero" more than any other title. What especially left an impression was the scene where Rin and Archer show up in the rary. When they break through the is embracing Rin as if he is protecting her, and that made me feel the bond between them. It's one of the scenes love very much.

**Sugiyama:** The combination of Rin and Archer often shows their relationship during battles. Like back in [UBW] how Rin would jump from the rooftop first, then say "Archer, I'm counting on you!"

**Ueda:** That's right. There is a proper sense of trust there.

**Suwabe:** Archer is all about trust and quality. (laughs) It's weird to say this after so long, but he is established as a bowman who doesn't use bows much. He's supposed to be the ranged attacker, but he engages in melee combat. Rin is also an unusual mage as she aggressively engages in combat. They're both tricky fighters. (laughs) I guess you could say they're a duo of like-minded souls. (laughs)

**Q:** The scene where Rin declares to Shinji, "Because you took advantage of Sakura, you have completely turned against me as my enemy" was also impressionable.

**Ueda:** When I first recorded the line, I was imagining her tone of voice to be slightly rougher. As it was right after an action sequence, I put in more emotion aimed at Shinji as I acted. However, I was requested a retake, and the director gave me orders for "Rin to keep behaving like a mage. Level-headed as possible, with no intonation fluctuations". I was told to act as if she was devoid of
emotions, and that's why the final take ended up having that tone.

**Sugiyama:** When you think about your opponent, emotions start moving. However, since Rin doesn't acknowledge Shinji as much of an enemy at all, her emotions are not swayed. That balance of unwavering emotion was just exquisite. I felt a contrast between Shinji whose words get rougher while Rin is
cold-hearted.

**Q:** Sakura runs out of control after this, and the group heads to the church. There, Shirou finds out the truth about Sakura, and that Rin and Sakura are siblings. What were your impressions about this scene?

**Ueda:** At the end of the previous movie, Rin saw the insect den within the Matou estate. So I believe that Rin has realized what Sakura's current condition was. Here, Kirei Kotomine uses all of his Magical Crests to treat Sakura, but I believe Rin had a feeling of gratitude there. Usually, he is a priest that cannot be trusted, but in this scene Rin may have been surprised that "Kirei would go this far". It's likely that her antagonism had already shifted to Zouken Matou by then.

**Q:** And in the rain, Shirou swears that he will be a hero of justice just for Sakura, and his path starts going a separate way from Rin and Archer.

**Ueda:** The fact that Archer was the one that spoke to Shirou in that rainy scene was impressionable. If it were the other routes, I believe it would have been Rin that speaks to Shirou in that situation.

**Suwabe:** It felt like a scene that left an impression of what exactly he (Archer) was. It's as if where Rin and Archer stand within this title became clear.

**Sugiyama:** Indeed, it was a choice that turned your back on the [UBW] route.

**Suwabe:** Right. It was the moment where your route selection was solidified.

**Sugiyama:** Shirou and Sakura start to have differences from Rin and Archer, but you can feel what each other are thinking even without saying anything. Shirou's choice may not be the best, but it's not impossible to understand why he made that choice. That's why Archer says something, but doesn't try to stop him. That relationship left a lasting impression.

**Theme 3**

### Archer's farewell that Rin doesn't know about

---

**Q:** The battle at Einzbern Castle was highly impactful. Please let us know your impression.

**Suwabe:** It was an amazing action scene that had you white knuckled and drew you in. I believe some of you will see this footage for the first time with this Blu-ray, but I really wish you could have experienced the force of this scene on the big theatrical screen! It was definitely a scene worth watching,

**Ueda:** I thought about how amazing a <Servant> with unlimited magical energy can be. I understood that Illyasviel von Einzbern was superior as a Mage, and I thought I was fully aware of Berserker's powers, but Saber Alter's overwhelming power surpassed even that. I mean, she was unleashing so much attack power that it was similar to every attack being a Noble Phantasm one. I felt despair, wondering how to go about it to win.

**Sugiyama:** It truly was a battle from mythology. Seeing Saber Alter matter-of-factly cornering the powerful Berserker without saying a word just made me feel like I naturally wanted to cheer him on, like "Go get her, Berserker!" (laughs)

**Q:** The scene where Archer severed his own arm and leaves the field was impressionable, as well as his expression towards Rin as he says,
"Take Care, Tohsaka"

**Suwabe:** It was a different way of parting than in [UBW]. I was able to record the line feeling all sorts of emotions. If show a lot of emotion here, it may have been a scene where it was easier to cry. but I didn't receive such direction and Archer is a poker-face after all. I acted while stepping on the emotional brakes, However, it seems many people have properly read into his sentiments, and I have received many opinions about that scene. I was very thankful of that.

**Ueda:** The fact that Rin is unconscious when Archer bids farewell is lonely, but at the same time that is what makes this [HF], the Sakura route. Because if Rin shows any emotion towards Archer or thinks back to Archer's past, it no longer becomes the story of Shirou and Sakura. I felt it was a parting scene fit for [HF].

**Suwabe:** Everyone watching this movie knows of Archer's feelings that Rin has no knowledge of. It was drawn out in a way that the story and its viewers have a relationship similar to accomplices.

**Theme 4**

### The Hero of Justice that Shirou chooses

---

**Q:** With Archer out of the picture, Rin finally heads to the Emiya residence and faces Sakura. What was your impression of Sakura in Chapter 2?

**Ueda:** Until now, I think the image of "a girl who is being protected" was strong for Sakura. However, from midway through Chapter 2, she starts showing a strength to stand up against the Matou family and her own destiny. She even shows moments where she has a will to stand against Rin. I realized that she actually had a very strong will.

**Q:** In the scene where Rin talks about memories of when she first met Shirou in the storehouse, Sakura listening in on the conversation sheds tears. Sakura's complicated feelings towards Rin left an impression.

**Ueda:** In this [HF], Rin's life is in danger multiple times. Shirou saved her in the previous movie, and Archer saves her in Chapter 2. I felt that Rin in [HF] kept getting rescued by others. But when I look at [HF] again, there is also a part that is convincing as to why. The shadow... Sakura is unconsciously targeting Rin. Sakura calls her "Big Sister", but one can't let her guard down.

**Sugiyama:** Perhaps the shadow is speaking on Sakura's behalf about her jealousy.

**Q:** Mr. Suwabe and Ms. Ueda, how did you react to the "hero of justice" that Shirou selects in Chapter 2?

**Suwabe:** I feel that choosing to protect something close to you is an act that stems from primitive (fundamental) emotions, and I feel it matches the current atmosphere where politics and economics worldwide is leaning towards conservatism. The first Fate/ stay night game was released 15 years ago, but Shirou's actions in [HF] unexpectedly fit in with the atmosphere of society in 2019. I feel it has a lot of reality to it.

**Ueda:** I actually wasn't fond of the expression "hero of justice" that was depicted in Fate/stay night until now. I felt that the "hero of justice" for the Saber and Rin routes were somehow distorted. But the "hero of justice" in [HF] is "a hero of justice just for Sakura" so it's different from the past versions. I feel it is the purest form of a "hero of justice", so I want to cheer for him. If Sakura stays alive, Fuyuki will have a major crisis, so I do have complicated feelings...

**Sugiyama:** What ending will Shirou's choice of what a "hero of justice" should be in Chapter 2 lead to? I definitely would like you to see through it to the end in Chapter 3.

**Suwabe:** But he's good at "pretending to die, but not really dead", so perhaps... (laughs) From hereon, I would like other characters to
remember Archer a whole lot, and it would be nice if I could appear in the flashback scenes. (laughs) He entrusted his arm to Shirou, so it would be wonderful if Archer made an appearance in Chapter 3 as well.

**Q:** Ms. Ueda and Mr. Sugiyama, please let us know what you are looking forward to in Chapter 3.

**Ueda:** I really am looking forward to "Rin and Sakura facing each other". As the one who's in charge over Fuyuki, she has a duty that she must stop Sakura no matter what, and I think Sakura will finally seriously stand against her. So, I look forward to facing off against Dark Sakura. **Sugiyama:** I feel that Chapter 3 will be one battle after another. After seeing the Berserker vs. Saber Alter battle in Chapter 2, there are doubts on whether or not it's possible to win it all... but borrowing Archer's arm, Shirou will like to try his best. I'm looking forward to the recording sessions already.

**Theme 1**

### How each character exists as seen in Chapter 2

---

**Q:** Please tell us your impression of your character after seeing the completed version of Fate/stay night [Heaven's Feel] II. lost butterfly

**Shitaya:** I first saw itt in a screening, but it was an amazing experience where I got to watch it together with Ms. Aimer (theme song) and Ms. (Yuki) Kajura (music), and Kana (Kana Ueda / CV for Rin Tohsaka) I felt so obliged that I left a seat open between me and Ms. Aimer, and sat together with Kana to watch Chapter 2. But after watching, Kana told me, "I wish I left a seat open between us". (laughs)

**Kadowaki:** I invited Liz (Miho Miyagawa/ CV for Leysrtti) and Sella (Haruhi Nanao/CV for Sella) and the three of us watched the screening together. At first, I was genuinely looking forward to it as "I could finally see Berserker!" but when I actually watched him fight, I was so awestruck... I felt myself tearing up. It was just a very happy time.

**Q:** Ms. Shitaya, you went to a cast greeting showing in Los Angeles in the United States and Taiwan as well.

**Shitaya:** Yes. What was common in both places was when I answered "Shinji Matou" to the question "Who was the character in Chapter 2 that left a lasting impression?" the audience got really excited. (laughs) I think a big part of it was that Director (Tomonon) Sudio was realy careful in drawing Shinji in this Chapter 2.

**Sugiyama:** I can't agree with Shinji's actions, but it's not like only his negative side was being drawn. It was more like Shinji was drawn as a human.

**Shitaya:** There is something about Shinji's emotions that is convincing. The deluxe theater pamphlets had an enclosed drama CD with Shinji as the main character, and when you listen to it, you can tell what
Shirou and Shinji's relationship was like in middle school.

**Sugiyama:** Right. In Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works] (hereafter[UBW]), Shirou tells Issei (Ryudou) after Shinji makes a sarcastic comment, "That'sjust how he is. You get used to it the longer you know him." but I feel like the meaning behind those words just sinks right in.

**Shitaya:** If something was different maybe they might have both been members of the Archery Team, and have been good friends the whole time.

**Theme 2**

### Changes from chapter 1 to Chapter 2

---

**Q:** Now, we'd like to hear details about Chapter 2 as well. Please tell us your impression of Illyasviel von Einzbern in Chapter 2

**Kadowaki:** I became very happy seeing Illya's very cute smile. Illya in Chapter 1 almost kills Shirou, but that was a turn of events that Illya didn't envision at all, so she was pretty shocked by it. Because of that shock, Illya in Chapter 2 was able to approach Shirou with that smile.

**Sugiyama:** For Shirou, Illya is the Master of the Berserker that tried to kill him. Shirou was perplexed by Illya's changes.

**Kadowaki:** One of the catalysts that changed liya in Chapter 2 is the fact that she got to know Shirou as a person. At the point of Chapter 1, Illya probably only had no other objective than to win the Holy Grail War as a participating mage from Einzbern. But by meeting "someone who acts in an unthinkable way for a Holy Grail War" like Shirou, she may have overlapped her own ideals that she perhaps harbored in early childhood.

**Shitaya:** Illya may look very young, but she has experienced many things, and has very complex emotions towards Shirou and Kiritsugu Emiya. And when Illya is reunited with Shirou as he looks for Sakura, the scene where she pats Shirou on the head and tells him, "It's only natural to protect the person you're in love with" and makes Shirou remember the feelings he was about to ever so slightly lose left a lasting impression.

**Sugiyama:** For Shirou, Illya's words must have been a lifesaver. Because he had that support, Shirou was able to confront Sakura.

**Q:** Mya and Kiritsugu Emiya are drawn impressively in Chapter 2.

**Sugiyama:** When Kiritsugu's name is mentioned in the conversation with Shirou, Illya tones down noticeably. The relationship between Illya and Kiritsugu isn't mentioned clearly in Chapter 2, but from Illya's facial expressions and attitude, I feel that the negative relationship between them can be conveyed. However, that impression of Kiritsugu that Illya has starts to change at the Emiya residence after hearing the conversation between Sakura and Fuji-nee (Taiga Fujimura). Through Fuji-nee's words, she learns of Kiritsugu's feelings, and I believe that changes Illya's own feelings she has on the Holy Grail War as well.

**Shitaya:** Taiga is just speaking to Sakura, but the stage production making it so that Illya is listening to that is wonderful.

**Sugiyama:** I'm sure Illya has never met an adult like Fuji-nee up until now.

**Kadowaki:** When she first meets Taiga, Illya is alarmed, like "Who is this!?"

**Shitaya:** It's true that your first impression is "Who is this!?" (laughs)

**Kadowaki:** In the "Tiger Dojo" in the original game, they are mentor and apprentice, so in the back of my mind I really felt something was off. (laughs)

**Theme 3**

### Conversation as Mages in the Holy Grail War

---

**Q:** In the battle at Einzbern Castle, Illya confronts Zouken Matou, and the fierce battle of Berserker was drawn out. Please give us your impressions of that scene.

**Kadowaki:** Illya and Zouken's conversation was one that made you feel the history of the Holy Grail War. The only person that can say anything to the current Zouken is Illya who incapsulates the history of the Einzbern. And though it was obvious, nothing resonates with the current Zouken anymore...

**Shitaya:** Fate/stay night has many characters in the younger generations, so when Mr. Masane Tsukayama (CV for Zouken Matou) says something amongst them, the worldview of [HF] suddenly gets a lot heavier.

**Sugiyama:** It makes you feel the history of Mages and the Holy Grail War all over again.

**Q:** What did you think about the Berserker vs. Saber Alter battle?

**Kadowaki:** I had seen the footage in progress during the recording, but the awe I felt when I saw the completed footage was so great there is just no comparison.

**Shitaya:** Berserker was throwing one of the towers of Einzbern Castle! (laughs)

**Sugiyama:** And Shirou was being blown away by the blast wave. When he was being blown away, I ad-libbed a voice, but it was completely drowned out by the blast noise. I guess that conversely added realism.

**Q:** Archer entrusts Illya to Shirou during the fight.

**Sugiyama:** Right when he saves Shirou and Illya from the blast wave, Archer throws Shirou aside (laughs), but hegently lays Illya down. No matter what the situation, Archer is kind to females.

**Kadowaki:** Nothing less from the guy at the top of popularity charts.

**Shitaya:** He really is awesome.

**Kadowaki:** Even in parting. He really told his tale with his back.

**Theme 4**

### The humanity of Shirou and Sakura's tears

---

**Q:** In the second half of Chapter 2, Rin Tohsaka and Illya arrive at the Emiya residence. It's where Sakura has very complex emotions.

**Shitaya:** The fact that she could spend time together with her idol and actual big sister Rin was surely something Sakura found joy in. However, that location being the Emiya residence must have given her complex emotions. After all, I'm sure she has a feeling of not wanting Rin of all people taking Shirou away from her.

**Sugiyama:** For Sakura, Rin is an idol and the target of her emotional sway.

**Shitaya:** In the storehouse where Shirou and Sakura talked about memories of when they first met, Rin tells Shirou the same exact episode of their first encounter. Sakura overhears that, and that becomes the catalyst for her to head to Shirou's room. Because Shirou accepted her there, Sakura's heart had a bit more wiggle room, and she becomes able to call Rin her big sister. I felt in that scene that Sakura's emotional flow was drawn out very carefully.

**Q:** What about for Illya?

**Kadowaki:** I think at that time Illya is trying to gauge what Shirou and Sakura will be doing.

**Q:** The scene where Illya and Sakura exchange words is impressionable, too. The later scene where she tells Sakura "You will die" was one where you felt Illya as a Mage.

**Kadowaki:** I'm sure that Illya knew where the ending point was.

**Sugiyama:** By Sakura running out of control, the damage will increase, but even then, Shirou will not try to kill Sakura. I felt she was implying that she should think about what she should do on her own will.

**Q:** There was a scene where Rin and Illya have a conversation between Mages

**Shitaya:** I felt that the side of the Mage was showing for both Rin and Illya. Shirou was also reciting rather difficult names. (laughs)

**Sugiyama:** Kischur Zel... he was just drawing a blank. (laughs)

**Shitaya:** Shirou is the one that will inherit Archer's arm, so I fee that Rin has feelings that he is a part of her Servant. That may be why she feels that she'd be trouble if he loses!

**Sugiyama:** Both Rin and Illya resonate with Shirou's feelings of wanting to save Sakura, and do everything in order to assist Shirou. When you think about it that way, all of the affection is being showered at Sakura.

**Q:** Shirou in [HF] swears he will be "a hero of justice just for Sakura", but how do all of you see this choice?

**Shitaya:** I can't help but to think as Sakura, but the fact that Shirou made the choice to "protect Sakura" really made me happy. Sakura has already created so many victims, so it may be imprudent to rejoice in her survival, but even then Shirou would be the only one that would choose to keep Sakura alive, so Sakura has to die if Shirou forsakes her. Shirou risks his life to move forward, not afraid of getting hurt. But, Sakura herself has a resolve that it can't be helped if she is killed. In fact, when Shirou points the Kitchen knife at Sakura, Sakura was awake, But Shirou has inner turmoil while holding the kitchen knife, and ultimately chooses to betray his former self. The tears Shirou sheds at that point left an impression, and it just really touched a chord with me. Even during the recording, I was watching Mr. Sugiyama act, and I almost shed a tear at that moment.

**Kadowaki:** I think there were very few people that cried in the Fate series up to now. in this movie, Shirou cries thinking about Sakura, and Sakura is very emotional when she thinks about Shirou and even sheds some tears. I felt that when they both think about
each other as another human being, tears are being drawn.

**Q:** The story is finally reaching the climactic final chapter. Please tell us what you're looking forward to.

**Kadowaki:** I've been able to participate in the cast greetings and events starting at Chapter 2, but I directly felt all of the feelings that the cast and audience felt, so I want to keep those feelings in my heart as I head into Chapter 3. Just like everyone else, I am wondering how things will unfold, but I am looking forward to the recording sessions for the final chapter.

**Shitaya:** At the end of Chapter 2, Sakura turns into the form of "the Makiri's Grail", but she hasn't said one word yet. There were liens in the original game, but in Chapter 3 I feel 1 like to build the character anew as the theatrical version of [HF]. The original
game had two endings with a normal end and a true end, but what will happen in the movie? From the bottom of my heart, I am looking forward to the ending that Director Sudo will draw out. I am looking forward to seeing everyone again in the spring where cherry blossoms (sakura) bloom.

**Kinoko to Takashi's Q&A**

### Kinoko & Takashi's Questions and Answers

**Fate/stay night [Heaven's Feel] Il lost butterfly version**

---

**Q:** When Shirou decided that he would be a hero of justice only for Sakura, what did Archer think? <Minazuki>

Kinoko Nasu (hereafter "N"): He acknowledged that "he is now completely different from myself" and didn't pity or admire. It's something like a stern judge watches where a criminal will end up.

Takashi Takeuchi (hereafter "T"): Hmm. So for Archer, it ended up being a parting from his own curse.

**N:** Perhaps, simply the fact that "it was possible for myself to pursue such a path" became somewhat of a salvation. Even if it had nothing to do with EMIYA, and was something that wasn't tangible for him.

**Q:** Even if Dark Saber were to accept Avalon from Shirou, would she be able to use it? If she could use it, would her Dark state be undone, or would it change characteristics? <Godoh>

**N:** Too bad! Dark Saber doesn't even try to look at a utopia...!

**T:** What do you mean?

**N:** She pursues a common ground that is more realistic, so she doesn't even think about entering a utopia... It's like, "It's good to pursue ideals. But humans die meaninglessly. That is how I will treat them."

**T:** So that's why Dark King loves junk food.

**N:** That may be a king's way of relieving stress. There is nothing that soothes the soul as a burger when you want to be mad but can't show anger...

**Q:** Zouken Matou tells True Assassin, "Don't ruin everything by letting the Einzbern girl get away." In the end, he let her get away, so did True Assassin get a lecture from grandpa afterwards? <Norimori>

**N:** If the result of putting in your best effort is a failed mission, grandpa will not give punishment. There was the irregularity of EMIYA as the antihero, but that made an exit from the field so it would be simply scolding like "That is enough, but there is no next time."

**T:** Seriously? That's like the ideal boss!

**N:** The conditions were basically a win for Zouken, so a big part of it was that even letting her get away here, he could totally recover from it.

**T:** I had the image that he would be a lot scarier.

**N:** He is kind to people whom he thinks he can use.

**Q:** The battle between Saber Alter and Berserker clearly was a level that you couldn't blame the gas company. How did Kotomine cover it all up? <Nunba>

**N:** There possibly can't be any gas pipes running around there.

**T:** He leaked out a government conspiracy theory.

**N:** Oh, no way. It's just a forest fire. A forest fire. Though it did get put out in an instant.

**T:** Yup. It's something that happens often in the Fuyuki district.

**Q:** If Saber Alter and Gilgamesh seriously fought each other, which of them is stronger? <Takenoko>

**N:** Dark Saber has lost what you call the protagonist's compensation, or rather the glimmer of the stars. So a miracle wouldn't happen against Gilgamesh so it would simply be a match of their abilities...

**T:** If it's not in life but as Servants, wouldn't it change a lot depending on who the Master is?

**N:** Back in life, they both had extraordinary magical energy generation so it would be a pure battle of firepower. With his omnipotence and cunning (INT), Gil is slightly advantageous here. If it's a Servant battle, Dark Saber can win against Gil if the "Master's capacity as a Mage" is high. Gil will win against Dark Saber if the "Master's charm as a human" is high.

**T:** What does that mean?

**N:** It's because Gilgamesh tries to fight only with his own power, regardless of his contractor being a first-rate Mage or third-rate Mage. 

**Q:** I think Rin and Illya had vague ideas of the true nature of the dark shadow before Shirou, but what was going through each of their minds emotionally? <Fruit Ponch Samurai M>

**N:** Rin was almost sure, but with no "irrefutable evidence" she didn't jump to conclusions, and is trying not to think (about killing her) until that time comes. Illya feels pity like "poor thing". **T:** In other words, Illya is looking at her like "I feel sorry for you, but you're being sent to the hog farm tomorrow"?

**N:** That metaphor is as cold as the alleyways in England so I have some issues with it, but well yeah, something like that.

**T:** (whistles) Noblemen-1

**Q:** What kind of reaction would Shinji have if he found out Archer's true identity? <Mizuame>

**N:** He'd laugh and not acknowledge it, like "There's no way that can be true!"

**T:** Is there a chance Shinji can become Heroic Spirit SHINJI?

**N:** Even if someone like Rin were to explain the Heroic Spirit system in detail and prove how all the facts are related, he'd look bored and shoo Rin away, like "So what?"

**T:** He's a guy that lives only in reality...

**Q:** What intention does Sakura have when she rated Kotomine as "he cannot beat me"? Did she have some chance to pick up on Kotomine's desires and characteristics? <Kitsuneme Lambda>

**N:** As the Dark Grail, she instinctively felt that "I am stronger".

**T:** Like she (Sakura) is advantageous 10-0 no matter what?

**N:** Right. But well, I don't think Sakura back then thought that she really was holding his heart in her hand.

**Q:** I think Rin and Illya had vague ideas of the true nature of the dark shadow before Shirou, but what was going through each of their minds emotionally? <Fruit Ponch Samurai M>

**N:** Rin was almost sure, but with no "irrefutable evidence" she didn't jump to conclusions, and is trying not to think (about killing her) until that time comes. Illya feels pity like "poor thing".

**T:** In other words, Illya is looking at her like "I feel sorry for you, but you're being sent to the hog farm tomorrow"?

**N:** That metaphor is as cold as the alleyways in England so I have some issues with it, but well yeah, something like that.

**Q:** If Sakura had stayed in the Tohsaka house and Rin was adopted into the Matou family, how would each of them have ended up? <Futaba>

**N:** In the end, Sakura couldn't be handled by Tokiomi (the Imaginary attribute is too rare so Tokiomi who is simply a brilliant person couldn't teach her) so she would be sent to study abroad at the Clock Tower or something-

**T:** Rin would be Dark, and ultimately end up as the Heroic Spirit TOHSAKA Please refer to Capsule Servant for details.

**N:** Oh no, she wouldn't end up like that.

**T:** But she already has!

**Q:** If Sakura had been sent to the Edelfelt family instead, what kind of life would she have led? From looking at the Case Files, it seems Edelfelt is quite out there as welll. <Manumanu>

**N:** A babyfaced super-dark heel chatracter would be created.

**T:** Bondage Sakura..!!

**N:** Seriously speaking, Luvia is of a similar disposition as Rin but believes in aristocratism, so she would prioritize strengthening talent. As a result, you have a cool and dark yet good-natured top tier Mage.

**T:** That's a wonderful thing~.

**Q:** Did Zouken have a choice to become a Dead Apostle when he sought immortality? If he did, I'd like to know why he didn't transform into a Dead Apostle. <Pon De>

**N:** If you become a vampire, the Holy Church will be after you all the time, so he couldn't take that risk. If his objective (goal) was to become "immortal" he may have turned into a vampire, but other than that, well, it's whether or not he had the talent to become a vampire.

There are only about 27 idiosyncratic people like a certain Ms. Yumizuka and her "You thought I was common? I'm actually a SSR!" in this world!

**T:** What? Aren't there a few more out there?

**N:** Yeah, let's say we undercounted and add about three more.

**Q:** There are various departments in the Clock Tower, but what department did Zolgen Makiri belong to when he was at the Clock Tower? Since he had written a paper about Ghost Liners, was he in Spiritual Evocation? <Madao Ginzuki>

**N:** Likely Botany and Curses. He probably reached the Einzbern as part of the research to reach the Root, and thought that he could prove the existence of Ghost Liners which are a permanent and not temporary way for a soul to be.

**T:** So Heroic Spirit summons are all thanks to Einzbern?

**N:** Heroic Spirit summons in itself is Magecraft from the Clock Tower. Einzbern are descendants of alchemists that succeeded just once in the "materialization of a soul". So it all stems from the hypothesis that if you have the Einzbern system (Holy Grail) you can summon a Heroic Spirit which was previously thought to be impossible.

**T:** I see. That's it. Did you get that, Madao?

**Q:** Can Sakura in the other routes live just like other ordinary girls? Even if she doesn't run out of control like in the HF route, I'm worried about how the insects affect her. <Dyumi>

**N:**...

**T:** Why are you silent?

**N:**...

**T:** Say something.

**N:** Believe in your dreams.

**Q:** Was the spell for Heroic Spirit summons something that the Three Families came up with? <Kariyan the Shut-In Cat>

**N:** The original text exists elsewhere. but they made an arrangement in the details so that the wishes of the Three Familes are embedded, Kariyan.

**T:** Wishes?

**N:** "The eradication of all xxxx from this world" are their... or rather, Zolgen and Justeaze's wishes. Nagato Tohsaka just kept an eye on how those two felt.

**T:** You get a glimpse into complicated relationships there.

**Q:** BAD END 30 In the original game (which fans call the "Ironhearted END") Kotomine declares that Shirou will decide to kill Zouken, Illya and Rin to survive until the end. How does he go about killing all three of them? <Hero of Justice>

**N:** With how weaklings stand in mind, and with disregard to personal safety, he spares nothing engaging in one kill per person. He basically creates "if I can swing things into this situation there is a 1 (Shirou) to 9 (opponent) chance of winning, and a loss is instant death" situations and survives until the end.

**T:** A Holy Grail War is something you can win like that?

**N:** Barely if you use time, luck, humanity, and everything else as tools to win. But these tools disappear once you use them. You can't ever replenish it, either.

**T:** Great tasks cannot be completed while sane. And that's why you call those doings that of the ironhearted, I guess....

**Q:** In the ending credits for this movie, the role played by Ms. Kawasumi was "Saber Alter. What are the definitions for "Dark" and "Alter" in this work?

**N:** Dark is when "something that was white is contaminated and turns black". Basically falling to the Dark Side. In Fate/stay night, it just doesn't flow well to say "Dark Saber" so that later got the "Alter" title. Originally, "Alter" would be an affix for when "that Heroic Spirit is summoned with an alternate side/ interpretation". No matter how different they are, they are the same Heroic Spirit.

**T:** When a Dark Servant is called Alter. it just looks cool on paper, too. By the way, Alterego is also categorized as an alternate take, but is it okay to understand that it's different and separate from Alter?

**N:** Alterego is when "one persona of that Heroic Spirit gains independence as a separate entity" so it is categorized as a separate individual. Altria and Altria Alter are the same person, but "BB" and "Passionlip" are different people, right?

**T:** It just gets confusing because there is an Alterego named "Okita Alter".

**Q:** If the two of you were to say the line "Yeah, I'm going to betray," what kind of situations would it be? <Viewing Flowers with Everyone>

**N:** When I deny existence of a 2D waifu.

**T:** The day of the original deadline.

**N:** And when I end up using chicken wings (club) in Dark Souls.

**T:** When my lunch on the day I decide to go on a diet was ramen.

**Q:** What were the honest opinions of TYPE-MOON staff when they watched HF Chapter 2? <Yuuto>

**N:** The first feeling of "I can die right here" since TsukiFes. Actually, I think my mental immunity was destroyed, as the day after the screening I caught a cold and was bedridden for a few days.

**T:** I was awestruck, and trembled.

**N:** How did all of the staff react?

**T:** On the way back from the screening. we were like "let's talk about it while eating!" but the restaurant we entered wasn't too tasty so all of us that day ended up a bit dejected.

---

God resides within the details.

For Fate/stay night (Heaven's Feel] II. lost butterfly, that one phrase is the feeling that ultimately filled my heart.

Drawing, stage production, music, acting, screenplay. Everything in Chapter 2 was overwhelming, but the foundation that held them all were the details in all the depictions.

Many elements were cut away in the movie adaptation... emotional sway of the characters, the romantic setting, the promised indication of doom... in order to fit everything into two hours, I noticed that information was embedded in any and everything.

Even without lines or scenes, elements in the game are "things that are positively there", so a tremendous amount of effort, creativity, and love were encased within.

That is not just limited to the drama of the characters. 

Beauty of the city shown when the protagonists move off camera, details of the minivan just parked there, aging of the rails along the road people overlook, depiction of night rain that hits your heart, decadent beauty of grandpa Zouken's fun arboretum... they were all drawn as important aspects.

Those details make [Heaven's Feel] to come into life as [Heaven's Feel].

So those that played the game version back in the day, and we who made the game version, would all remember what "us back then" felt after watching Chapter 2.

In any creation, there is not one second of unnecessary scenes, but for this movie each and every second is built on heavy, deep affection.

While being a monster title so captivating that the viewers forget to breathe, this movie has scored the best score within the genre of "a film based on a game".

As an anime fan, and part of the original game staff, that fact makes me happy and proud.

If we were able to create something that so much affection could be poured into, our 15 years was something that was very fortunate.

Chapter 1 was shocking as it established an anime title as "Japanese Film".

Chapter 2 laments by changing the shock into excitement and awe, then further into despair.

And all affinities and all desires are achieved in the salvation of Chapter 3.

Sincerely looking forward to the next chapter that will oversee this final miracle.

**Director Interview**

## Tomonori SUDO

**Fate/stay night [Heaven's Feel] II. lost butterfly interview**

This interview is a reprint of the "Black Pamphlet" that was created as a special gift to those that went to theaters. This is based on questions received from users as well as normal questions.

---

## The theme of Chapter 2 is getting to "Shirou's choice", and what happens afterwards-

**Theme 1**

### Fate/stay night [Heaven's Feel] woven by 15 years of history

---

**About Fate/stay night [Heaven's Feel] (hereafter (HF) Chapter 2, please tell us your thought after seeing the completed film.**

What was most impressionable was where Shirou tells Sakura how he feels, the "Rain" scene in the original game. Watching the completed film, this scene was done very beautifully, so I felt relief as the director. The long cut where Shirou approaches Sakura was good. The voice acting and the music matched the animation, so I feel that we were able to create a scene that was highly emotional. 

**Which cut did you first get working on for this film?**

The first thing I drew was the "photo of young Rin" that was displayed in Rin's room. I wanted to adjust her clothing among other things, so I told the staff "I will draw this cut myself". 

**We heard that you were a TYPE-MOON user that purchased Fate/stay night on release day. What was your impression of the Sakura route back then, and can you tell us about how you went to draw it for this movie?**

Myself included, the original game players Sudo back then played the Sakura route (Heaven's Feel]) after playing the Saber route ([Fate]) and Rin route (Unlimited Blade Works). I believe many of the users played these three routes in succession, and I feel there was shock and amusement that we felt because we did so. Currently, if you download the smartphone app, you can play the Sakura route before the others, and I'm sure there are people that find out about Fate/stay night through the other titles in the Fate franchise. When that happens, even taking one character Sakura Matou as an example, you can now interpret her as multifaceted. Now that it's been 15 years since the original game release, I sought to face the original game once again in creating an anime for this movie. 

**Back when it first came out, what kind of feelings did you have towards the Sakura route?**

Of course, I was engrossed in playing [Fate] and [Unlimited Blade] Works as well, but [HF] was especially my favorite. I had felt reading through the other routes that Sakura would also become a heroine, but I didn't understand what kind of a girl Sakura was. I grew to like Sakura after playing [HF]. My impression is that it wasn't love at first sight when the character art was first
introduced, but that I grew to love Sakura through the story.

**So you have deepened your love for Sakura through the story. Mr. Nasu previously mentioned that Sakura's prototype was Kohaku from Tsukihime...**

I feel that is just talk about putting her into one genre of heroines, and that Sakura and Ms. Kohaku are not that similar. I mean, you just want to add an honorific for Ms. Kohaku. (laughs) There may be common points in their settings, but I believe there is a difference in how much they can act in order to fulfill their objectives. Was there something she wanted to protect from before encountering the protagonist? Or was there nothing to protect until she encounters the protagonist? That point should be a big difference in terms of character personality.

**Theme 2**

### Rain falls, and the snow melts

---

**We'd like to inquire what you think while going over the story, mixing that with questions from those who have watched the movie. First, about the beginning of Chapter 2, what kind of introduction were you intending?**

I was conscious that this was a trilogy, so I wanted the beginning of Chapter 2 to be at Ryudou Temple which was the final setting in Chapter 1. I wanted to emphasize the existence of the shadow while the users were thinking, "Wait, Saber is there." And by making Shirou say, "What... in the hell... are you..?" I made sure that the main story of Chapter 2 would be "to chase after the true nature of this shadow". In the process of chasing after the shadow's true nature, the relationship between the characters start to change. I have an image that I erected a guide sign as a movie.

**In Chapter 2, depictions of shadow are made in great detail. The depiction of Shirou assaulted by a shadow that turns into something like a black stain was like a horror film.**

I wanted to express "the existence disappears, but traces remain" here. I drew an example of what happens to ordinary people when they are assaulted by the shadow. If I drew it out here, even if we don't make complicated explanations later the users will imagine that "shadows are just like that". I had such an effect in mind. This scene functions well towards the end of the movie, when we depict the people of Fuyuki City being assaulted by the shadow. 

**Chapter 1 ended with a small pileup of snow. But in Chapter 2, the snow has stopped and starts to melt, and later rain starts to fall.**

I thought about adding "rain melts the snow, and what was hidden comes into light" as stage production for Chapter 2. The ground after the snow melts can be all soggy and often can't be described as all that beautiful. I wanted to suggest an element like that where "what you didn't want to see comes into light".

**Sakura seems to not be feeling well in the beginning. Is this because she was waiting for Shirou in the snow at the end of Chapter 1?**

Right. There are no lines that shows that she has become ill, but wearing a traditional winter coat, eating porridge, and being absent from school should explain that well enough. Also, it's not simply that she is feeling ill. Sakura had mobilized Rider in order to save Shirou from True Assassin at the end of Chapter 1, so there is also the fact that she is probably lacking magical energy.

**And with everyday life in Fuyuki City, the opening theme plays. The cityscape in this scene leaves a lasting impression.**

ufotable has been drawing Fuyuki City from back in Fate/Zero, but it feels like urban art has been increasing more and more... (laughs) Fuyuki has a gantry crane in its port so there is a foundation for trade. New City has fashionable shops as well. When you head to the mountains there is a church there. Overall, you have the image that it is a prosperous city.

**Moviegoer's question/Mega Mannequin in the scene where Illya (Illyasviel von Einzbern) and Shirou meet, Illya was making a snowman in the park. She made a small snowman, a big snowman, and snowballs, but were they placed that way with any particular intent?**

The fact that the snowmen and snowballs were in front of Illya is metaphoric for something. One snowman is big and one is small. The final snowball is a half-made snowman. As a cut of them in front of Illya is inserted right when they talk about Kiritsugu Emiya, I hope the intended meaning is conveyed to everyone. 

**Did you use the art from Mr. Takashi Takeuchi (original character design) as the motif for the scene where Illya jumps on him?**

Right. I wanted to recreate Mr. Takeuchi's art as is. In Chapter 1, Illya was seen from Shirou's point of view as a scary existence that commands Berserker. But that leads to the cheerful Illya in Chapter 2, so I wanted to properly bring out the hesitation in Shirou. And so I was wondering how to draw a cute Illya when I saw an illustration of Illya in Fate/hollow ataraxia and I thought that was it.

**Then, Sakura is taken by Shinji and Shirou heads to the school library. Rider's actions were impressionable in this scene.**

One reason I set the library as the setting was to fully utilize the special actions that Rider takes. Also, many large bookshelves are lined up in a library, so I was thinking about how your field of vision can be blocked. Rider tells Shirou, "You won since you have good endurance." By this, she meant he persevered until the knife Shinji was pressing against Sakura's neck was removed. While Sakura is in danger, she is harming Shirou despite taking it slightly easy. But Shinji got caught up in the mood and moved the knife away from Sakura, so Rider shows her will of wanting to save Sakura.

**The scene where Rin Tohsaka and Archer appears through the library glass window had a very heroic depiction.**

I told Ms. Yuki Kajiura (music) that "Rin is Sakura's hero". Against Rider, Rin stands before Archer and launches an attack. Normally the <Servant> is in front and the <Master> falls behind, right? The Caster formation in [Unlimited Blade Works] used this common practice to their advantage. But in this formation with Rin and Archer it's not constrained to one particular form. Rin can make the first attack to curb the enemy, and Archer delivers the final blow in this combination. I wanted to draw out how both of them understand that. 

**Then, Rider's Noble Phantasm is unleashed. What thoughts did you have for depicting Magecraft type effects like this?**

One advantage of the Rider class is that they can use multiple Noble Phantasms. Therefore, by using "Blood Fort Andromeda" followed by "Breaker Gorgon" to release the seal, she uses Cybele, the Mystic Eyes of Petrification. I thought that at this point, Rider's True Name should be obvious even to those who have never seen Fate before, but I still wanted to convey it all through the visuals instead of explaining through dialogue. I had given orders to move Rider's hair like snakes. 

**Sakura's magical energy goes wild, but that depiction was also surprising.**

In the original game, it was depicted as something similar to a lance made of magical energy flying over, but my interpretation is that Sakura at this point in time didn't have enough Magecraft training so I wanted to have her attack in a way that doesn't have much of a specific direction. I felt it would be better if magical energy floats where she didn't intend and that bursts. The image is similar to that of a porcupine or a sea urchin. Combined with the nuance of water element that exists in Matou's Magecraft, I had it so that ripples would spread along the ground.

**Theme 3**

### What should be protected

---

**Please tell us how you portrayed Kirei Kotomine in Chapter 2.**

He has his own agenda for using all his Magical Crests to treat Sakura. We haven't quite disclosed it at this point, though... Kotomine assists Shirou and Rin not out of kindness, and it's not simply to have fun. He is a complicated character, and not necessarily colored in any one color. His role in the movie is someone who advances a situation where Shirou and Rin can't advance by themselves.

**And in the rain, Shirou chases after Sakura The key to the Emiya residence becomes an important item here.**

In this "Rain" scene, I wanted to use the key to the Emiya residence so I had intentionally left out the handing of the keys over back in Chapter 1. This was something I was thinking about from back when were in production of Chapter 1. 

**Here, Illya gives a kind word to the agonizing Shirou.  How was stage production for Illya?**

During the storyboard stage, I had envisioned a much longer scene. I love the original game, so I think about how I want to put every single episode into the film, but since this is a movie, I have to cherish keeping the flow as a movie. So that the scene between Shirou and Sakura would be at the peak, I adjusted the overall balance over and over.

**And Shirou confronts Sakura. Ms. (Noriko) Shitaya mentioned that she agonized over the line, "I'm... not a virgin, you know?"...**

Sakura is trying to stop Shirou's advances, right? In this scene, she said the one thing she least wanted to say as the final means to do so. I slightly changed the order of the lines from the original game so that the key to the Emiya residence would leave a lasting impression.

**Moviegoer's question/Kotori In the scene where Shirou and Sakura / Rin and Archer pass by each other. an arrangement of "believe" (ending theme song for TV anime Fate/stay night (Unlimited Blade Works] <hereafter [UBW]> was playing in the background. Was this showing the branching out of the progressed compared to the Rin route?**

Actually, when I had meetings about the music with Ms. Kajura, I didn't ask anything about what i specifically wanted her to do.
I didnt tell her Fate/Zero song here, [UBW] song in this scene, and so on, leaving for Ms. Kajura to decide what songs to choose. I feel that Ms. Kajiura added wonderful music to the movie based on watching all of the titles.

**Shirou and Sakura come home, and a scene depicting magical energy recharge shown. The storyboards show quite the details in her course of action, like Sakura's lips as she licks his fingers" "letting fingers go from her mouth" "a strand trails from her tongue" "upper lip brushes over lower lip" "Sakura swallows at start of of. Please tell us points you were picky about in this depiction.**

I had the feeling that I wanted to draw Sakura here, but at the same time, I wanted to show that Shirou was not accustomed to things of that nature. Also, this served the purpose of telling all the users "magical energy recharging can be done simply with blood" Shirou and Sakura do make love afterwards, but there is more meaning to that act than simple magical energy recharging I wanted to draw the relationship between them as one that needed to have that physical bonding.

**From here, Sakura's menacing side is depicted How did you think you wanted to draw the other side of Sakura such as Because he (Kotomine) cannot beat me That's right. All I have to do is keep from stepping outside?**

I intended in the mirror scene for stage production that gives the "this is me, but not me feeling". By drawing a distorted facial expression from Sakura within the mirror, the viewer's attention doesn't turn to the "Shadow" that is behind Sakura. However, after Sakura leaves the washroom, the out doesn't change, and then after a while the "shadow" quietly glides along. I felt that's where I could add some surprise. I eliminated vertical movement like when a person walks from the "shadow's" movements, and make it simply side
sideways. It's an image of the movements of something supernatural.

**Theme 4**

### Deathmatch at Einzbern Castle where heights were sought to the end  

---

**Mr. Takahiro Miura (TV anime [UBW] director) handled the storyboards and stage production for the Berserker vs. Saber Alter battle at Einzbern Castle. How were you involved with this scene?**

I created the scenario together with Mr. (Akira) Hiyama (screenplay), and then asked Mr. Miura to create the storyboards. The general gist that Berserker would be defeated repeatedly by Saber Alter and would revive after each defeat was already set, but I left the details up to Mr. Miura. Due to the nature of Berserker's Noble Phantasm "God Hand", his stock of lives was 11 so it would be bad if he
was defeated 12 times (laugh), but since Mr. Miura was the director for [UBW], and we have gathered a staff that have been working on the Fate series for a long time now, I could rest assured when entrusting the scene with him. I did ask Mr. Miura a few additional points, and to insert a cut that uses an image from the original game where Saber Alter points her sword at Shirou, but that was about all.

**What do you think about Saber Alter's strength?** 

I wanted to create a difference in how Saber Alter fought compared to the Saber that has been depicted up until now. I believe Mr. Miura picked up on my intent and added in actions where she uses her fists.

**Moviegoer's question / Seddon Berserker's Noble Phantasm has the characteristic "develop resistance to attacks received", but was he unable to develop a resistance against Saber Alter's "Sword of Promised Victory"? Or was that more of brute-forcing her way through even with the resistance kicking in?**

The idea is that he is developing a resistance, but Saber Alter's attacks are getting gradually stronger so is pushing ahead. The only time she unleashes its True Name by mouthing it is the final time. I asked for the Berserker getting absorbed into the shadow to have some effect that depicts him attempting to resurrect again, such as glimmering eyes and glowing body at the very end.

**Saber Alter only had one line. Please tell us the feelings you had for her.**

I made it so that Saber Alter doesn't speak until her visor is broken. I had wanted the terror and pressure from staying silent to be felt by the audience. She only speaks businesslike even after the visor is broken, giving her a very cold-hearted impression. Even when Shirou screams, "Saber!" at the end, she never looks back. I would like all the users to imagine what kind of feelings she has while she behaves as such.

**Moviegoer's question / Kika The damage on the Einzbern Castle is so great that I'm worried about Sella and Liz (Leysritt). Are they all right?**

Indeed, there were explosive sounds during the Berserker vs. Saber Alter fight, but when you look at the final explosion closely, the main mansion of the Einzbern Castle didn't break all that much. "Sword of Promised Victory" was unleashed from the rooftop, so the surrounding buildings and castle wall were destroyed, but the main mansion only suffered damage to a part of the roof. I would appreciate it if you could wait for Chapter 3 to check on Sella and Liz.

**How was the staff for this part, seeing from your vantage point?**

Let's see, I think they did a marvelous job. It was an action part that was the highlight of the movie, so I feel they were working on it until the very end. Thanks to that, I feel it ended up being a scene that is well worth watching.

**Theme 5**

### Artificial Phantasm

---

**If there was anything you had in mind while drawing Shirou wielding the holy shroud, please let us know.**

In the character setting art, I wrote that "the grafted Archer's arm is slightly longer" and "it is slightly more muscular than Shirou's" as points to watch. Concerning how his arm hardly moves, in the original game it didn't seem strange at all, but in animation it affected the depiction of everyday life so it was difficult. For instance, there is a scene towards the end that a blood-soaked Sakura is at the entrance and he props her up. He must support her with just his right arm, so I had to think about how to animate that act. He needs to open the entrance door with his right hand as well, and it's the same for his meal scenes. We proceeded with the production so that there are no hitches visually while showing everyone that "his arm doesn't move" there.

**Moviegoer's question/Max What kind of conversations did you have with the staff about the scene where Shirou and Sakura make love?**

The stage producer here was Mr. (Kei) Tsunematsu, so I believed in him and trusted him with everything including all light sources. I had asked Mr. Tsunematsu to work on the pre-credit (before the opening theme) and storehouse scenes in Chapter 1, as well as the "Rain" scene in Chapter 2. My job was simply to adjust what was drawn as the chief animation director. I asked the animators "please make Sakura's lingerie like this", then we did much fine-tuning such as the color of the lingerie and color of the shadows. Would it be better to add a little pink? Or will it end up going to be the color of night anyway even if you faintly added color, as it is a night scene? That was where we went through trial and error, but this is the scene where Sakura asks, "Am I defiled?" so I felt that from a stage production intent, it would be better if her lingerie was pure white.

**Moviegoer's question/TOSI In the scene where Illya first appears, there were many occurrences of Illya looking at the other characters, which left a lasting impression. Did you intend on such an effect?**

Illya after arriving at the Emiya residence is really "watching" everyone. She "watches" Shirou, Sakura, and what kind of environment Shirou grew up in. In the original game, by the player making their choices, Shirou takes action and based on that, Illya's actions will change. But you can't do the same thing in a movie, and Shirou is looking at Sakura, so we can't suddenly do something like "Look at Illya!" Therefore, we set it up so that something inside Illya changes as she observes what is around her. She is merely observing, so it's not like she talks about what she feels at the time. I believe what Illya was feeling here will come to light later in Chapter 3. Illya acts on her own to seek out her own answer. I believe that she is a girl that can do that.

**Theme 6**

### About identity

--- 

**Please tell us about Shinji Matou as well. Shinji had made "a small bottle that glows when a Mage holds it" but was this what he was making at the end of Chapter 1?**

Right. Since Makiri's bloodline has dried up, Shinji doesn't have any Magical Circuits. However, he is still studying Magecraft. As a result of his efforts, he somehow managed to create that potion. He can't make it glow on his own, but he can't toss it away. He is holding onto it out of some sort of attachment.

**Shinji is unable to throw out his feelings for Magecraft, so the glowing potion is his complicated emotions concerning Magecraft.**

Because Shinji had a powerful introduction to Magecraft at a young age, Magecraft is embedded into his forming of a sense of self. There was that book that Shirou hid into his abdominal area in the library scene. 

**You mean the book that Shirou "fortified" with Magecraft in the library battle. Shinji, seeing that is shocked, saying "Magecraft..."**

The title of that book is "Society and Developmental Psychology". For the author's name, we borrowed the name of Erik H. Erikson, the developmental psychologist that advocated the concept of "identity". This word "identity" is one I feel applies to everyone who were in that library (Shirou, Sakura, Rin, Shinji). 

**You mean, what are the identities of Shirou, Sakura, Rin, and Shinji?**

How were you affected by your parents at a young age, and what will be your identity when you face society? I believe that will be the difference between the characters in this series. Especially for Sakura and Rin, as what they received from parents at a young age are drastically different. I believe that is why there is a great difference in their ways of life.

**The formation of identity is greatly affecting how they live later on.**

Rin received "pride" from her parents, while Sakura didn't receive that. I believe that is the biggest difference between the two.

**Thinking on what Shinji inherited from his parents, it's a bit melancholic. Shinj's expressions with his hands were impressionable, too.**

If all of the acting is from facial expressions, it starts to weaken over time as a way to express things. Especially for psychological depictions, we modulate the screen by using various forms of expression such as just hands, just the back, not showing the character at all to begin with, drawing the camera back, and closing in with the camera.

**Theme 7**

### Arboretum influenced by Inverted Moon of the Heaven

---

**Moviegoer's question / Shirobana Sakura's dream was drawn like a fairy tale. Whose idea was it?**

I had an image within me of a "dream Sakura sees after she is no longer suppressed" due to her becoming one with Shirou. I created the footage by linking that with Sakura in real life that continues her preying behavior. Sakura in the dream is wearing a princess dress that a child would come up with, and I made her facial expressions to be slightly younger. The plush toy floating down the river is an explanation of the <Servant> that flowed over to Sakura's side. The castle within the dream is white space created with 3DCG, but actually it has the same size as the alleyway in real life. Her position as she stands in the castle is also the same as her position in the alleyway. This castle has only one entrance, and in real life we set it up so that Gilgamesh comes in from that entrance side. The art on display within the castle are images she saw when she touched upon Shirou's shadow in Chapter 1.

**After this, the shadow indiscriminately starts to devour people, and the city falls into chaos. What did you keep in mind for this scene?**

By creating all sorts of different expressions for shadows from the beginning, we wanted the viewers to make all sorts of fantasies. For instance, just with the shadow passing through a car, you can expand your imagination that surely there is a black stain left behind on the seat where someone disappeared from. Also, what was important was for Shirou to watch this as news on TV. What will Shirou think once he saw this news? It was a scene that linked up to things like that.

**A wounded Sakura then returns home. Shirou, Rin, and Illya welcome her back, but at this point, the truth about Sakura might....**

Rin and Illya are likely aware. Shirou has a vague notion, but he is still averting his eyes from them. 

**In the imagery scene afterwards, another Shirou appears and severs Sakura's head, and Kiritsugu Emiya and Archer pass in front of Shirou.**

This is a scene where we "slam reality into Shirou". The fact that Kiritsugu and Archer are walking in a different direction denotes that he will change his way of life compared to them. That is the meaning of "kill one for the sake of ten". This scene is showing that in a visual way.

**And finally, Shirou confronts Zouken Matou. The two are talking in the Matou residence arboretum, but the plants and animals within are drawn in an impressionable way.**

I agonized over what setting to have this scene in, I thought it would be good to have a situation where bugs chirping could be heard, so we decided to design an arboretum anew. When Zouken showed up at the Matou estate gates in Chapter 1, I believe you were able to hear bugs chirping from beyond the doors. The image is that space beyond. It's full of presence of life, but that is why it makes it eerie. I felt such an atmosphere was necessary. The other thing we were careful about is the ceiling, The arboretum has a domed ceiling, but I thought it would be nice if people could infer Inverted Moon of the Heaven, the stained glass that shows up in Fate/hollow ataraxia.

**Butterflies are flying around in that scene.**

I thought blue butterflies would be good. There is a magical charm meaning in the butterflies themselves, and I thought it would be good if they gradually fly higher and become absorbed into the "Inverted Moon of the Heaven".

**Moviegoer's question / Rutonir Here, Zouken was talking about how the relationship between the shadow and Sakura as the contents of and the gate for the Holy Grail, but how much was Zouken able to control the shadow?**

Just like Zouken said, my interpretation is that he could only "calm it down". Even in Chapter 1, when he asked it to "stay in the Ryudou Temple lake", it heads over to Central Park. (laughs) Basically when Shirou and Rin are together, it wanders over. My image is that he has almost no control over it at all.

**Then Saber Alter appearing from the shadow is not someone that Zouken is controlling, either?**

Right. The only <Servant> that Zouken has control over is True Assassin. In Chapter 1, he was controlling Caster, but that was simply Magecraft using insects. For details concerning Saber Alter, I would like you to wait for Chapter 3. I just would like everyone to understand that she will never run out of magical energy.

**Theme 8**

### The Last Day

---

**And the last day where Shirou and Sakura spend together arrives. Here, everyone is drawn living their everyday life as Ms. Kajiura's soundtrack plays. Were you debating showing Illya singing Die Lorelei here?**

Die Lorelei is an important scene in the original game, so I did consider including it. However, this was just a day for Shirou and Sakura, so I didn't want to put too much emphasis on Illya. Shirou and Sakura eating breakfast, Rin trying to find a way to break though the situation for both of them, Illya singing Die Lorelei for Shirou who isn't speaking despite accompanying her on her shopping trip. I didn't want to make any differences in those events that happened during the day. Before this scene, Illya overhears Taiga talk to Sakura about Kiritsugu Emiya, and she is using that as a base for trying to cheer Shirou up. But, if we were to play Die Lorelei here, the impression on the other characters grow hazy. In order to draw a day for just Shirou and Sakura, I chose to go with the stage production that you see.

**Theme 9**

### Sakura Matou and "I beg you"

**Sakura, returning to the Matou estate in order to stop Zouken, bumps into Shinji. Shinji tosses the "small bottle that glows when a Mage holds it" to Sakura, but the mindset behind that is perplexing.**

I think Shinji knew what would happen if he threw the potion at her-that if Sakura were to hold the bottle, it will glow. You're talking about the mindset of tossing it at her even if he knew. In this scene, Shinji is in a condition where "no good comes of seeing him right now", and when Sakura calls out to Shinji who entered the room as "Big Brother", I created his facial expression to not show where his eyes are looking at. We made it so that Shinji's facial expression can't be seen until he later slaps Sakura's cheek. I wanted everyone to imagine what kind of expression was on his face at that moment.

**With that invisible expression, Shinji compliments her, "You're amazing, Sakura."**

She was told she was amazing, but since Sakura understands Shinji well, she knows that her big brother isn't the type of person to make compliments like that. She has a premonition that her big brother has gone insane. Normally, when Shinji compliments people, I think he compliments them in a way that isn't quite as honest. In the first place, it's impossible that he would ever compliment Sakura. That's what Sakura notices. That's why when she is slapped, Sakura thinks "He did it because I made a mistake." She ends up thinking that unreasonable things happen because she does something wrong. And that's why she concludes "It's fine if I persevere." But this time around, there was something that she simply couldn't endure. That is the flow behind how this scene was structured. 


**Shinji's tears in this scene were impressionable, too.**

These two are not related by blood, but they do sometimes feel like they're siblings with many similarities. They both harbor the feeling of why things ended up this way. I wanted to show that they end up missing each other's paths, but they are still very similar. And that is when Sakura thinks of something she has never thought of before.

**You mean, "I wish this man didn't exist." What was the intent behind the shadow dwarves that show up here?**

I had wanted a prop that I could use for Sakura's psychological depiction. Sakura watches these dwarves with a frightened glance, but she understands what they are. That is why she wants to reject the dwarves dancing the releasing dance, but she can't avert her eyes. And when the oppressed girl with no self-confidence until now wears the black dress, she gained a power that was too great. That sense of omnipotence would be something she tastes for the first time in her life. But nobody in this space can compliment her on it, or feel happy about it. Shinji has died, so Sakura is all alone in this room. That is why she makes the illusions she created for herself (the shadow dwarves) praise her. I hope the message comes across that she is the "emperor in his new clothes", and when looking at things objectively, it is a very hollow situation.  Because the person she wants a compliment from the most will not compliment her. If that's the case, she has to have the dolls she created to say, "You are amazing." That kind of misery is hidden within.

**What kind of an image did you have for the expression of "Sakura Matou - the Makini's Grail" (known as Dark Sakura) at the very end?**

In the original game, after this, she laughs like, "-aha, ahaha, ahahaha." I'm sure Sakura felt something that made her laugh unintentionally. Perhaps it was becoming self-aware that she was enjoying the act of murdering someone, or a sense of omnipotence due to gaining power, or even perhaps realizing on her own foolishness. I drew her such that among all feelings of that nature, she couldn't help but loosen up and bring a smile to her lips.

**The cast were talking about how the theme song "I beg you" was speaking on behalf of Sakura about her feelings.**

When I requested Ms. Kajiura to create the theme song for Chapter 2, I gave her footage that had a fair amount of completed animation. So I think she created the theme song "I beg you" for us after seeing how the story was turning out. I also felt this during "Hana no Uta" for Chapter 1, but I am really thankful that Ms. Kajiura is creating songs for this movie. I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart that she would create songs that accompany the movie so well.

**For both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, the theme songs are both songs about Sakura.**

When I was in a meeting with Ms. Kajiura, she mentioned that "the only chance I have for a dark theme song with a hard beat would be Chapter 2, right?" Indeed, Chapter 2 is perfect for a song with dark style. I was able to hear Ms. Aimer singing for the cast greeting on first day of theatrical release, but it was just overflowing with emotion, and I felt once again that it was a wonderful musical piece.

**Lastly, please give us a message for all fans.**

First of all, thank you very much for watching Chapter 2. I'm sure that many people are looking forward to Chapter 3, so the entire staff will do our best to deliver something that is even better. I am eagerly awaiting the day in spring 2020 where I will meet you again in the theaters.
