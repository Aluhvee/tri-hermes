## Prologue - The Shaggy Dog makes the Heroic Warriors Come Running



When you wake up, something is licking you. You suspect Fou, but it's a dog you've never seen before.

Barghest enters your room, carrying clothes that have undergone care from Miss Crane and Habetrot. She sees the dogs and wants to pet it, but it flees.

Elsewhere, the dog encounters Saber Alter who senses that its hungry and offers to give it some dog food she keeps around. She wants to name it 'Cavall the Third'.

Alexander happens upon the scene too, finding the puppy quite beautiful and calling it 'Pelitas'. He offers it some water, which it refuses.

Next Sei appears, calling it 'Okinamaru'. Not actually her dog though, but it does resemble the one she once had. She starts petting it to the others envy. Alexander notices it has a heart mark on its back.

Caren, Cu and Ko-Gil show up and observe too. Caren offers to pet Cu too, if only he gets down on his back and begs like a dog. Gil is a bit suspicious of the dog.

The puppy feels overwhelmed by the people trying to give it a name and escapes again.



It runs past Abigail, Bunyan and Carmilla, and even the scary Hessian Lobo.

Eventually it takes shelter in Izou's room, crawling up next to him for shelter, much to his annoyance.

Abigail and Bunyan come in asking for it, but Izou plays dumb, hiding it in his clothes.

Next is Alexander, Sei and Saber Alter who ask much the same. Once again, Izou chases them off.

He talks a bit with the puppy, rationalizing that he only started hiding because others wanted to find it.

Eventually you enter Izou's room together with Hokusai and Barghest. Izou once again plays dumb, but Hokusai does a loud "boo!" and scares the puppy out.

An unknown female Servant emerges, calling the puppy Sousuke. This is the puppy's real owner.



At the control room, Da Vinci explains the situation to Izou. The Servant is Kyokutei Bakin, Japan's first professional full-time writer. Bakin affirms, somewhat stammering the words out.

Mashu and the whole crew are impressed but... why a woman (again?) (for the xth time) (used to it now but) (maybe we're the ones who are strange?) (what are parallel worlds anyway?)

Regardless, Da Vinci confirms they didn't summon Bakin. She's a stray Servant who appeared on her own at the summoning circle. You're the one who first discovered her.

However, Sousuke the Bernese Mountain Dog showed up before Bakin did. According to Bakin, Sousuke is supposed to be her familiar but...

In any case, this led them to finding the puppy in Izou's room.



Izou thinks it sounds fishy. Familiars should be one with their masters. He's not gonna be so naive, this is clearly an assassination attempt! Bakin doesn't know what to say.

In some ways, Da Vinci agrees, it is odd. Barghest will have to accompany Bakin while they investigate her. But there's also Hokusai, who knows Bakin better than anyone else. What does she think?

Hokusai is strangely quiet, before loudly exclaiming this isn't Bakin at all, but his adopted daughter Omichi. Bakin shamefully admits as much.



Barghest, you, Mashu and Bakin go to the Cafeteria. Bakin wants to thanks Izou for watching over Sousuke but he's gone off somewhere.

Mashu gets an analysis report from Da Vinci: Bakin is a Rider, has a physically female body, estimated physical age of 16-18, mentally sound. However, her Saint Graph is strangely paltry (in terms of magical energy). 1/8th of a normal servant.

Hokusai reasons this is why Bakin only has one of her 8 Dog Warriors with her. In Bakin's work Hakkenden, the 8 weren't literal dogs, but that seems to be the case now.

In any case, this appears to be why Bakin's consciousness is only that of Omichi, though the details are unknown. In any case her 'Bakin' personality is mostly missing. Bakin requests to be called Omichi from now on.

As they said, she's missing most of her Dog Warriors. Sousuke has the single pearl of a necklace bound to him that reads "duty". The other Dog Warriors have ones with other letters. Only when all these are combined will Bakin be complete.

Hokusei found Omichi's acting from before a bit amusing. Bakin sighs, but is at least relieved to have the familiar Oei around.

Mashu wonders why Omichi is in Bakin's place in the first place. Maybe something similar to Hokusai? Bakin is confused. Hokusai? Where? Oei reveals that her little squid is Hokusai, much to Bakin's surprise who just thought Oei was using her father's name.

In desperation, Bakin wonders if maybe then Bakin is inside of her little Sousuke and starts shaking it about, calling out for Bakin. Barghest feels like it should be impossible, since Omichi and Bakin aren't related for real, but...

Suddenly Sousuke starts glowing, and an alarm sounds. Someone is aiming to shot Storm Boarder down! Barghest and Mashu protect you from the impact.



Afterward, Da Vinci reports the damages in the control room. They're back, but no staff have been lost or damaged.

Sion declares they've detected something like the large Singularity they just were at. In any case, they have to do something before it attacks again.

Ushiwakamaru and Kiichi Hougen show up to the meeting as well. Ushiwakamaru recognized the arrow: it was Genji. She detected it first, and reported it fast enough that they could get the barriers up. The first arrow is simply meant to adjust aim. The second is the real dangerous one.

Sion brings up a map: it's a clustter of Micro-Singularities! The assailant is in one of them. The arrow went through space-time to attack them. Hokusai likens these Singularities to the "Nanmei", the ocean south of Japan, full of small islands.

Da Vinci has a plan though! She's already working on a certain part to deal with the next attack. She'll need help though.

In addition, they've detected 7 grails. The attacks won't stop at just two if they have that many resources. They'll need to find the assailant and stop them as fast as they can!

She'll leave that mission to you. Sion tells you to take Bakin with you. Omichi doesn't think she'll be of much help, but Sion insists. No time to explain why though.

All they can know is this: their enemy is Chinsei Hachirou Minamoto no Tametomo! The very same you met in the last Singularity. No doubt a very powerful Servant.

They'll give the rest of the information during the mission. Omichi still feels bad, but will try her best.



Mission start. They've named the Micro-Singularity Cluster as "Nanmei", after what Hokusai called it. Ushiwakamaru, Barghest, Hokusai and Bakin will accompany you.

Rayshift countdown commences, and Sousuke starts glowing. This resonates with Izou and Lobo, who are located elsewhere. Why does everything always go wrong at this step, moans Goredolf.

Sion reveals that they detected a Holy Grail from Sousuke as well, but faintly. Now what does that say about the Micro-Singularity Cluster? The Rayshift sequence continues regardless, as the same light engulfs all your Servants.



## Chaldea's 1st Bow - The Three Stellar Hunters Let Loose as Tremendous Arrows



Ushiwakamaru is left behind in the aftermath of the Rayshift. Da Vinci and Mashu are busy with preparations and don't even notice her until she speaks up.

Feeling rather dejected, Ushiwakamaru goes to talk to Sion. Turns out Ushiwakamaru not going along wasn't the only problem. Izou and Lobo were taken to the Singularities as well.

Ushiwakamaru requests another Shift, but they can't. She'll have to stay behind and act as an informant about their enemy.



Atalante, Orion and Chiron show up, having been called there by Da Vinci.

The new parts they developed are called "Saint Graph Pods". They can be installed on a Servant, storing their Saint Graph inside, and eject it like a shot. Easy to think of it like a simple Rayshift.

The Pod is shot onto a certain spacetime coordinate, manifest, fulfil their mission after which they are once again stored in the pod and returned to Chaldea.

However, only Archers can use them because of their "Independent Action" class skill. Otherwise the journey is too hard on a Servant. That's why the Greek Archers are there.

They agree it's a clever, if odd plan. Ushiwakamaru realizes once again that she's gonna be left out of the action and sulks.

Da Vinci orders the mission to start, who begin the Pod Launch Sequence. The three Archers are let loose!



Orion beholds the strange cosmic view from inside his pod. It's simply a translation of what the sensors can pick up. He's currently in a chaotic spacetime state.

In any case, Da Vinci understands that the fact that Orion has manifested means that the second shot has already been detected.

The detectors see a great wave of life, and Orion thinks its looks like boobies, much to Da Vinci's bewilderment. Kinda had that MILKY way vibe to it.

Regardless, Orion will deal with the attack and gets ready to fight. Da Vinci reminds him that he needs the Pod to return: defend it at all costs. Orion activates his Noble Phantasm.



--- [Battle against <White Arrow Monsters>] ---



Orion runs out of magical energy and returns to his pod. His attacks all connected, and the wave of light appears to be diffracted, but it starts to reform regardless.

The command room bustles with activity, as they prepare to re-intercept the wave with all their other pods.



## Southern Expedition's 1st Arrow - Rowing Toward Nanmei to Identify the Enemy



After the Rayshift, you find yourself together with the squad at a beach. Of course, Lobo and Izou are there for some reason too. Hokusai spots a familiar mountain in the distance.

Barghest quickly notices that Ushiwakamaru is gone. You hastily order Lobo to commence a search for her. You try connecting to Chaldea at Hokusai's advice, but fail. Not sure what happened, but something about Ushiwakamaru's Rayshift went wrong.

Barghest explains that though they can't establish full contact, Chaldea can detect their location through the Mystic Code you are wearing.

Lobo investigated the surrounding and found a small village, conveys Bakin. You are surprised to learn she can talk to the dog. She says its possible because of Sousuke.

Izou's distrust of Bakin is still present. In fact, isn't it likely Bakin is the cause of everything? Barghest says they should focus on the mission. Hokusai declares that if Bakin betrays them, she'll commit seppuku. See it as a way to keep the group from dissolving out of distrust.

You say you're not gonna let Hokusai do that, but you understand her feelings on the matter. Izou seems satisfied too, and apologizes. In any case, the mission awaits. Lobo starts leading you to the village.



Hokusai reveals they're in Ryuukyuu, known these days as Okinawa. How can she tell? Well, obviously because Hokusai has painted this place! It's not exactly like the original though...

Barghest wonders if that means Hokusai is involved in the creation of the Singularities somehow, she is Foreigner-class after all... Hokusai feels like its a natural thing to ask but says she'll explain:

Bakin is involved, then Hokusai is involved, then Tametomo is involved. To understand she'll lecture on Tametomo too. He's Ushiwakamaru's uncle, and was exiled to Kyuushuu in youth. He subjugated the whole province, and gained the name of Chinzei (old name of Kyuushuu) Hachirou (he was the 8th child in his family). After this, he returned to Kyoto where he got involved in the Hougen Rebellion. He eventually lost, but showed greater bravery with his bow.

Hokusai thinks about the Kyoto fire and gets distracted. Apparently something she does a lot, says Bakin. Hokusai gets back to it, and explains that Tametomo's draw arm was 12 cm longer than his other, letting him draw a bow that took the strength of 5 men.

After he suffered defeat in the rebellion, he was exiled to the Izu islands, but quickly conquered them. His opponents knew they couldn't let him be, and sent 500 soldiers to kill him. In response, Tametomo shot down their whole boat, containing 300 men, with just 1 arrow! The rest of the army arrived, and found Tametomo dead, having taken suicide.



But wait, this had nothing to do with Ryuukyuu. Hokusai says she'll leave the rest to Bakin, since it's about her book, Chinsetu Yumiharizuki. Before that can happen, Sousuke runs off.

Bakin reveals it seems Sousuke has found another of his allies. Before you can pursue, enemies appear on the road before you. Gotta take care of this first!



--- [Battle against <Various Monsters>] ---



For some reason, the monsters explode as you defeat them.



Anyway, you head over to the village in pursuit of Sousuke. Before long, Sousuke comes running back, something in his mouth. He's found one of the necklace pearls! The one with the sign for "Filial Piety". This corresponds to Shino, another dog.

Shino is a Shiba-Inu and makes Barghest internally squeel. They're like a Chivalric Order of dogs! Izou comments that she's acting creepy.

Suddenly, a unsteady signal comes flying in from Chaldea. It stabilizes, and Mashu reveals that Ushiwakamaru is with them. In any case, she'll first report about their battle situation...



## Dark Moon



In a vast sea-like void stands a lone shadow.



Calculation start:

An arrow worth 7 Spirit-Pearls was let loose.

No hero could deflect it alone.

And yet... Chaldea still stands.

He must shed his regality.

He must become like a fiend.

Like a Rakshasa cursing even the moonlight.

For his way...

For his Kingdom...



## Southern Expedition's 2nd Arrow - The Appearance of a Lone Canine Rumbles the Isles



Mashu explains Chaldea's situation. They are under assault of the second shot, Though Orion managed to weaken it, it has now split up into countless smaller arrows. Chaldeas Archer's are currently being deployed to deflect them.

Either way, Mashu will assist them with information from now on. Bakin introduces Shino, who doesn't care. Shino is above such minor matters. Mashu correctly identifies that Shino was the protagonist of Hakkenden. With Shino, Bakin feels much stronger.

Barghest realizes that Bakin's poor form is whenever the dogs are far from her. Just like what happened when Sousuke ran off before. Izou scolds Sousuke for not thinking about his Master's problems.

Just like in the original Hakkenden, the 8 Dog Warriors seem to attract each other by fate. That said, seems there are no more Dog Warriors around here. They prepare to get going but...



Hokusai spots an imperial proclamation written on a board. It appears to be a map of some kind, written in Japanese? Hard to read though... thinks Hokusai. Kiichi Hougen shows up and explains that the strange letter is a Minamoto clan family crest.

Seems to have a deeper meaning to it than they can deduce. In any case, it's a map of the 7 Singularities, with a red circle marking their current location: Musashi. Musashi, Sagami, Kouzuke, Shimotsuke, Kazusa, Shimousa, Awa, Hitachi. All corresponding to the old regions of Kanto! All together, the map calls the islands: Nanso-hakkei. The same Nanso as in Bakin's Hakkenden.



Bakin reveals her Saint Graph has been updated: she now knows the locations of the other Dog Warriors. Only the direction though. They should head for Shimotsuke.

Mashu speculates that each Grail they detected corresponds to one Dog Warrior, who further correspond to one of the islands. Perhaps looking for the dogs will help them locate Tametomo.

Barghest is still curious about Hokusai's connection, but for now it seems Bakin is more directly related to the Singularity: a good clue.

Izou is once again skeptical. Barghest growls. He doesn't mean anything bad! Izou doesn't feel its fair that they'll just use Bakin as a clue when she barely knows what's going on.

Hessian appears, cautioning against going to Shimotsuke: it might be trap. They settle on just collection information and then...



Mashu says sorry interrupting but, there's a massive energy wave coming onto them! The wave deflected by Orion has changed direction back to the Singularities! The islands of Hitachi and Awa are erased!

Mashu's signal gets weaker, but she manages to barely warn them to get out of the way. Barghest suggests perhaps returning to Chaldea, but Bakin says she'll deal with it.

Sousuke and Shino's powers combine, and start resonating with the Servants.



Suddenly, a reddish Rayshift looking phenomenon occurs. The arrows connect, and the island goes up in light...



## Chaldea's 2nd Bow - Shooting Down the Finest Volley of Arrows



Atalante, Chiron and Tomoe Gozen finds themselves in the sea of spacetime like Orion. They face up against the enemy wave that Orion caused to split.

Da Vinci informs that Orion did weaken its pure thermal energy, but in exchange its magical energy has increased. Her signal cuts out.

The Servants discuss their enemy. Tomoe had some ties to Tametomo in life, since he was Yoshinaka's uncle. She's never fought with or against him though, only ever heard of his tales. That they'd face up against each other now is the fate of Genji, she supposes.

They volley of arrows approaches, and the 3 Servants all activate their Noble Phantasms in response!



--- [Battle against <White Arrow Monsters>]　---



They managed to cut down on the volley's power, but are quickly running out of magical energy. Both Tomoe and Atalante return back to their pods.

Chiron stays behind and ponders something. It appears the arrows are getting stronger each time they are defeated. He'll transfer the data back over to Chaldea.





## Chaldea's 3rd Bow - Godly Bows Fletch Purifying Arrows to Cleanse Evil



Arjuna and Tawara Touta face off against the horde of countless White Arrows.



--- [Battle against <White Arrow Monsters> + <White Arrow Centipede>]　---



Da Vinci gets her signal back. The enemy is going faster than anticipated. She's driving their pods at the same speed, but its too close. Easier to shoot them down then, reasons Touta.

Arjuna remarks that he heard the arrow was supposed to simply be a very strong shot, but this is more like it's turned into the apparitions and foul creatures of lore. This is just as Chiron reported. The arrows are getting stronger.

Touta agrees. It seems they've become immune to physical attacks. What manner of theatre or fairytale have these sprouted from? No ordinary arrow could come this far.

Da Vinci is shocked to hear, but the words "theatre" and "fairytale" stick in her hear. In any case, it appears the enemy's Noble Phantasm has the ability to become resistant to their interception attempts.

In any case, the solution is simple: if their enemy lets off arrows of foul magic, they simply have to respond with ones of holy majesty.



Arjuna activates his Noble Phantasm. Touta starts getting the rice out... wait, wrong Noble Phantasm! Touta pulls out his bow and shoots off the right Noble Phantasm.



--- [Battle against <White Arrow Monsters> + <White Arrow Centipedes> (with <Physical Immunity>)] ---



## Southern Expedition's 3rd Arrow - The Four Virtues Assemble and Indulge in Gesaku



You wake up, stirred by a dog. Mashu's panicking voice can be heard as well. Either way: get up! You look around and the landscape seems mostly the same.

Mashu informs you that you were only unconscious for but a moment. Her connection is stable after the spacetime barrage ended. The effects of the attack appears to have faded. Should be safe for now.

It appears only Izou and Bakin is there with you. Hokusai, Barghest and Hessian Lobo are nowhere to be seen.



Izou points out you've they found two more Dog Warriors when they arrived here. As for Bakin herself, she's still exhausted from her fake-Rayshift thing.

Mashu points out that you're currently on Shimotsuke, the island Bakin pointed out before. Was this the power of the Dog Warriors? Bakin affirms, and introduces your two new friends: Tousetsu and Kobungo!!

Izou is shocked at Bakin's new tone of speaking. That's simple, Bakin's personality has gone from Omichi back to its rightful owner: Kyokutei Bakin themselves! The famous author of the Hakkenden! Not to worry, Bakin knows their circumstances still, having seen them through Omichi's eyes.

Somehow Izou is dissatisfied: Bakin's way of talking doesn't fit the graceful body of his daughter! Bakin is so noisy!!

Mashu surmises that them having found the necklace pearls of "Elderly Respect" and "Loyalty" is what caused the real Bakin to emerge. Bakin affirms, they're quite strong now!



Suddenly, monsters appear. They can't go searching for their allies quite yet! These monsters seem to have been chasing the two new Dog Warriors. Sousuke heard their pleas for help and took them here.

Regardless, Bakin and Izou prepare to fight.



--- [Battle against <Various Monsters> (with <Cloak of Hatred>) (Forced Kyokutei Bakin Support <NP Disabled>)] ---



Bakin reflects on the feeling of being a Servant. Strange that they had to manifest in Omichi's frail body. One thing is apparent at least, Bakin is still not in perfect form.

More monsters appear, and Izou thinks its gonna be hard to hold them back when... Lobo, Barghest and Hokusai appear and cut them down. Bakin gets excited at the sight of Hokusai.



But their reunion will have to wait: first they have to take care of the monsters.



--- [Battle against <Various Monsters> (with <Cloak of Hatred>) (Forced Kyokutei Bakin Support <NP Disabled>)] ---



They've defeated most of the enemies in the area, but still cannot find Tametomo anywhere.

Let's forget about Tametomo for now and focus on the other Dog Warriors. With Hitachi and Awa's disappearance, they've yet to explore Kousuke, Sagami, Kazusa and Shimousa.

Bakin tells them to leave the transporting to her. They can't control it well, but it should be better than last time. Barghest gets a thought... What happened to Omichi now that Bakin is here?

Bakin starts explaining that Omichi is still with them, inside. Omichi and Bakin are one and the same, that won't change. But Omichi seems to have hid herself for the moment.

Hokusai is a bit disappointed, she wanted to talk more to Omichi... Guess Bakin and Omichi have a similar relationship to her and her dad. Well, he's an octopus though.

At the statement, Bakin goes into shock. Wait, Tetsuzou (Hokusai's old name and the way Bakin calls him) is that little octopus?! Guess Omichi never told Bakin about it!



But they should get going. It's only from Kazusa that Bakin can't sense any Dog Warriors. Since there's 4 left, that means that 2 Dog Warriors are on the same island. They have no idea where to go, so you ask Mashu for her opinion.

Mashu suggests Kousuke, which is next to their current location and one of the biggest islands.

Sounds good, let's get going then!



## Chaldea's 4th Bow - Though the Twin Bowstrings of the Western Winds Resound, Abnomality is Afoot.



Billy and Jane are fighting in the cracks of spacetime. Though they fight on valiantly, they both have issues with the other's performance and quarrel vigorously.

Da Vinci interrupts the quarreling to inform them the arrows have now gotten really fast and mobile. They keep predicting and dodging attacks, like swerving bullets. That's cheating, says Jane. Billy points out she does the same thing.

Before their argument can reignite, Da Vinci recommends they use their Noble Phantasms



Billy and Jane activate their Noble Phantasms.



--- Battle against <White Arrow Monsters> (with <Agile Footwork>) ---



Jane and Billy go back to their pods. Ishtar's on standby, but... wait.

Da Vinci senses an abnormality: the arrows have started increasing; no, reproducing!



## Southern Expedition's 4th Arrow - Hiding in the Haunted City in Desperate Measure



Currently, you are on route towards the middle of the Kousuke island.

As it turns out, Lobo is currently carrying you by the neck in his mouth. You gave up your spot on his back to Bakin. No worries, Hessian can take care of a decapitated head should the situation arise! Mashu smiles. The Dog Warriors cannot enter spirit form, and so ride together with Bakin. The rest of your Servants are in spirit form. Barghest apologizes for the rush they've put you in, but at least this time their Bakin's Rayshift thing didn't separate them.

Bakin enjoys the sights, the weather, and the winds. What a great day to ride on a wolf's back. They're feeling kinda like Fusehime riding on Yatsubuki. Mashu explains: these are both characters from Hakkenden, Fusehime being the daughter of the Satomi lord, and Yatsubuki being her magical dog. Bakin is impressed at Mashu's knowledge. Bakin continues: in fact this whole place is like something they'd dreamt up for their books. This makes Barghest remember, right they were going through Tametomo's story because it had something to do with Bakin, before they got interrupted by monsters. Bakin has problem talking about their own books, but something about Tetsuzou's gaze is making them uncomfortable. Don't worry, telling stories is what writers ought to do, says Hokusai. They may have illustrated it, but have no right in feeling angry about it. Go on.

Bakin's Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki stars Tametomo as its protagonist, and though it follows history closely until his exile, the following events are from the realm of fantasy. Instead of killing himself and his children, Tametomo fled from his exile to the land of Higo, now part of Kumamoto in Kyuushuu. There he assembled allies and collected power until he could face his nemesis Taira no Kiyomori. However, his boats were struck by wind and drifted far south, to Ryuukyuu. There, Tametomo fought against corrupt sorcerers controlling the island through their monsters for the purpose or restoring it to its true ruler: Princess Neiwan'nyo. Barghest thinks princess and see Baobhan Sith in her head. As it turned out, Neiwan'nyo held within her the soul of Tametomo's lost love Shiramei-hime. Together with Shiramei-hime's son Sutemaru and his own son, does Tametomo save the country from evil and establish the true Ryuukyuu Kingdom! Cool story, but don't spoil it, says Izou.

Hokusai remarks that the monster kinda looks like her dad does now, well, in full form. It was input from the illustrator of Chinsetsu (Hokusai), much to Bakin's annoyance. Hokusai didn't illustrate for Hakkenden though, but left that to some apprentices instead. Though Bakin is known for Hakkenden these days, in the Edo period Bakin's fame rested on Chinsetsu quite a bit. Tetsuzou finds this obvious. Regardless, their long chat means they're almost at their destination. Lobo stops, and accidentally drops you as he does.

Once again they come across a village. Strange spirits are walking the streets. They're almost like shadows playing the role of villagers. They don't seem harmless, but Izou still cautions against standing out too much, worried for you. The massive Lobo and Barghest keep themselves hidden while Bakin, Izou and Hessian carry the dogs around. The aura of this place has made it hard for the dogs to use their sense of smell. You ask Mashu for analysis, but she can't make heads or tails about the place either. No problem, they'll find that Dog warrior some other way, says Hokusai. They eventually find an empty house and take camp.

After settling in, Hokusai comes in saying she's found another imperial proclamation. It's still hard to read, but now she can read "Duty", "Loyalty", "Filial Piety" and "Eldery Respect": the signs corresponding to the Dog Warriors they've found! Probably a kind of wanted poster. Unnaturally fast. Bakin presumes it has to do with the power of the pearls. Whoever is doing it is using the resonance of the pearls against them. Izou ponders it deeply and suspiciously.

One of the dogs tries to drink your water and get scolded. Barghest feels bad about it, maybe she should get something for them... Hessian comes in and suggests they wait until night for their search. If these spirits are awake at day they might sleep at night too. Mashu doesn't think you have enough time to waste, unfortunately.

Izou suddenly asks Bakin a question. He ain't all too smart but there's something bothering him. He's probably wrong but... better ask: Isn't Tametomo a king? Was he really this insignificant? That his country has no people except for paltry spirits? Would he really be satisfied with that? He needs to know what kind of person Tametomo is if he's gonna cut him down. Bakin hesitates to answer, so Hokusai takes over: in truth, Tametomo never became king in Chinsetsu, it was his son Sutemaru. He never became a king, either in reality or fiction. Even 7 Grails don't let him make real human subjects from nothing. Something about him is odd. Bakin admits that yes, they're proud of making Tametomo so famous after his life, but even so the person himself probably regrets that he ended up killing himself and his children. He probably wants to be reborn in the world. Bakin asks if the short-lived Izou didn't want the same, but Izou denies it: he killed too many people to deserve a second chance. Bakin gets a bit sad at the thought. Izou died earlier than his Souhaku and lived a frightful life. Izou smiles. Ultimately that's how he wanted to live. He doesn't feel bad about it. The Dog Warriors cuddle up with Bakin and comfort her...

Later, Lobo returns to report a disturbance outside. One of the Dog Warriors is being crucified! They rush outside and find the "Manners" Dog Warrior: Daikaku. Lobo oouldn't find Tametomo in his scouting, but he did find this. Is this a trap to draw them out? Or just torture? Daikaku howls in pain. Barghest and Lobo look on in anger. You want to save him, but Izou cautions against it. Suddenly, Mashu reports of a signal coming from the previously assumed disappeared Awa: the sixth Dog warrior is approaching. Hokusai starts yelling at Bakin to do something about their goddamn dogs. The 6th Dog Warrior appears: Genpachi holding the pearl of "Trust". With this many dogs assembled, Bakin has something they want to try. You accept.

Izou and Hokusai stir up trouble to act as decoys. Bakin begins her chant. The Dog Warriors combine into one watchdog: the magical dog Yatsufusa. Or rather, since she only has 6 Dog Warriors, Roku(6)fusa. With this, they'll break through the enemies!



--- [Battle against <Various Monsters>]　---



After your success in battle, you have fled the city. The monsters are still in pursuit. They can't deal with the hordes, but all they need to do is escape. Bakin's power starts to diminish, and Rokufusa divides back into its component Dog Warriors. Bakin bids farewell, and suddenly Omichi takes over their body again. But you have no room to consider anything: the enemies are coming.



--- [Battle against <Various Monsters>]　---



One of the cat monsters corners Bakin during the chaos of battle. The monster takes a hold of Bakin and teleports them away. Before disappearing, Bakin tells the Dog Warriors to stay behind with Chaldea. Only Sousuke goes with Bakin directly. Mashu analysis reveals Bakin has been transported to Sagami, probably.



## First Day



In a vast sea-like void stands a lone shadow.

The Archers who have fought up until now are pondered upon.

Magnificent! Such valor! Such cleverness! Such grit!

They are but slightly above, still.

Yet even so, he must become a true king.

And Chaldea will surely try and stop him.



Calculation start:

Inconsistency in guiding principle: ERROR

He is but a machine.

For him to let off the arrow of victory: ERROR

He seeks.seeks.seeks. his true lord: ERROR

Wrong---wrong.

He may be a mere fiend of archery, but he is his own king!

Upon this sea he shall build a world of warriors, ruling as the lord of Nanso.
