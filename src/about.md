## About This Wiki

TRI-HERMES aims to be a resource that values source material above all else. In a community where fanon is embedded in information spaces, TRI-HERMES will be completely transparent and display strictly source material unless said otherwise.

TYPE-MOON is a Japanese company with quite a lot of restricted content if one wants to learn all of the lore. This website will aim to host all 20+ years worth of content.

Furthermore, the community's great attempts to translate TYPE-MOON content are scattered throughout the internet, simply having it all in one place will be a great convenience.
