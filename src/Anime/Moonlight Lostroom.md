Announcement to all Chaldea staff.



The workday ends at 5:00 p.m.



A special arrangement thanks to our Acting Director.



This isn't due to Christmas holiday, but be sure to get a good rest.



Also, the Inspection Committee seems to be delayed, but they will be here once the weather allows it.



Their ETA is tomorrow at 12 o'clock.



We expect all of Chaldea's staff to receive them with modesty and pride.



Our functions are to be handled by the new staff once 2017 ends, but keep doing your job diligently as possible until then.



The inspection will begin soon.



What about you guys, will you leave for Clock Tower?



I'll be going back to London.



It's not like I really want to go back, but the situation here isn't any better.



This organization has ties to the UN after all.



I'd like to stay here.



We have high-end equipment, and I've grown fond of this place after protecting it for over a year.



And I don't really think the new staff will be able to handle Chaldea that well.



Excuse me for a moment.



Mr. Duston, can I ask you something.



No problem.



Is something wrong, miss Kyrielight?



I had a transmission from Senpa– from Fujimaru Ritsuka, but I can't find him.



And now the communication has been cut off.



Fujimaru?



Now that you say it, I couldn't see him in the cafeteria.



He wasn't in the medical room nor in the simulator either.



I locked the entry myself.



Then I wasn't seeing things...



There's a warehouse behind the Control Room, right?



It was a break room before remodeling.



If I'm not mistaken, Ritsuka was around there.



Thank you for your help. But...



Is there something wrong with that warehouse?



Nothing, it's just weird to see people around there.



The Lost Room is there, after all.



Lost Room...?



It'll sound like a ghost story.



They say people disappear when they enter at midnight.



And this isn't an isolated incident, there are many reports about it.



Now it's no more than a warehouse, a forgotten relic from the previous Director's era.



You want to reorganize humanity based in the caste system?



I won't allow a society where my destiny is set in stone from the moment I was born!



Go, Berserker!



Director!



What did you expect?



Who do you think I am?



I'm Chaldea's Director and owner of the Celestial Body Department in Clock Tower!



I'm Olga Marie Animusphere!



If we talk about Master potential, you of all people shouldn't be that surprised!



Director, above!



Look above!



Heroic Spirits from the Age of Gods aren't needed anymore.



This planet now belongs to humanity.



It's too late for gods to claim ownership over it!



Archer! Caster!



Good grief, at this rate I'll have to take care of everything.



Mashu...? Fujimaru...?



Where did you go?



Perhaps I didn't do well as a Master?



Tell me! What does this mean!?



Was I asleep...?



It feels like I had a weird dream.



Can we continue now, Olga?



Lev...?



Y-Yeah... Go on.



What is it?



It's about the unknown location observed by CHALDEAS the other day, Director.



That was it.



It's an alarming situation indeed.



At this rate, it will become a Singularity disturbing human history.



I wonder if I should report this to the Association and the UN...



I believe it's too soon for that.



Maybe CHALDEAS isn't working properly.



It's been eleven years since it began operations in 2004.



How about trying a maintenance?



That won't do.



CHALDEAS is a pseudo-celestial body copying the Earth's soul.



Stopping CHALDEAS is the same as killing it.



To begin with, my CHALDEAS lacks any imperfection.



If it has a problem, the reason must be an external factor.



An external factor...



Then, if CHALDEAS isn't at fault, the issue must be in the Observation Lens SHEBA.



Oh? It would be my fault if that's the case.



It's true that my SHEBA has been working for 10 years.



Perhaps its theory isn't up to date.



I never said I had complaints towards you, Lev!



There's the possibility of the staff in the Control Room overlooking something...



...due to the Association harassing them all the time.



The staff is completely healthy.



If you ask me, the one who should take a day off is you, Director.



I agree.



You haven't been sleeping properly since we discovered this anomaly one week ago.



Let the doctors check your condition.



Aside from Leyshift experiment report, the report for the selection of Masters candidates is also finished.



So, please use the next twelve hours to rest as much as you can.



We don't have a replacemente for you, Director.



Alright, I'll take your advice.



Speaking of rest, proffesor Lev must be sleeping well.



I've heard that going to bed and waking up early it's healthy.



That? Because my work was very exhausting before coming to Chaldea.



Once I completed SHEBA, I stopped seeing dreams.



That's why I can sleep soundly at night now.



What about you, Romani?



It's the opposite for me.



Since I came here, all I see are dreams.



But the dreams are always different.



The Organization for the Preservation of Human Order, Chaldea.



An organization established by my father in order to ensure the future.



The Animuspheres are a magi family that have studied the celestial bodies from long ago.



The mission of this family, of the Animuspheres, is to establish the thesis of the Grand Order.



That is, to guarantee the human history on this planet.



We see into the future to ensure that human history will continue beyond the present.



We don't aim for something big like "creating the future."



Our mission is to guarantee that "there is a future," and pass that onto other magi.



For that reason, the Animusphere created this Mystic Code.



Pseudo-Celestial Body, CHALDEAS.



Assuming the planet had a soul, we copied that soul and put it inside this model of the Earth.



But, we can't interfere with this second Earth.



That's because its phase it's different.



Still, it's possible to analyze it.



My father configured CHALDEAS one hundred years into the future.



As long as the light of civilization shines in CHALDEAS, we can assure the survival of humanity for the next one hundred years.



At the same time, CHALDEAS works as a library of Earth.



We can't observe in detail the future one hundred years ahead.



Because the future is always changing.



However, details of the confirmed past can be extracted.



It's a compass pointing towards the past of humanity, so to speak.



The success rate of sending someone to the past via Leyshifting after quantum decomposition...



...raises dramatically thanks to CHALDEAS.



My father founded Chaldea in order to observe and operate CHALDEAS.



He was a great researcher and a great magus.



That was my father... he left me alone after passing away three years ago.



His dead body was found in his office, back in 2012.



I don't even know if he had an accidental death or if he had an illness.



I was just a little girl who took over Chaldea after his death.



My father didn't leave me anything.



But I did receive his conviction as a magus of Animusphere.



It has been two years since I became Director.



And just when I thought I was finally starting to get things done...



But, why one hundred years into the future?



What do you mean, Mashu?



I mean, if the only thing that matters is to see that civilization continues, why not set it to one day or one year after?



It's about response time, Mashu.



If we set it to one day, there's nothing we can do if the light of civilization disappears.



There's no solution.



However, if the destruction comes one or ten years later, that's time enough to act.



I believe the previous Director set it in one hundred years to give humanity enough time to prepare.



I see now.



The previous Director thought things through.



B-But of course!



My father was a very prudent and thoughtful person!



He didn't act based on speculations nor wishful thinking.



That's true.



The Heroic Spirit Summoning System must be there for situations like that, too.



If an abnormality emerged in the past, it would be impossible for us in the present to fix it.



At least not if you don't go directly to that era to solve it.



Even if Leyshift succeeds, you can only send a magus by himself.



Once in that location, there's no weapons to rely on.



For that reason you need Heroic Spirits, the Servants.



Heroic Spirits exist as they're an extension of human history, in spite of how much it can change.



By borrowing their power, you can hold your ground in any era.



So, that's how it is.



Heroic Spirits are spiritual phenomenons of higher order.



The Throne of Heroes lies in a dimension above our own.



They're beings that transcend time.



Just like Chaldea, they're a security mechanism to protect The Human Order.



Because, as long as you make a contract with them, they can be summoned into any era.



The Heroic Spirit Summoning System isn't stable yet.



And first we must secure those Master candidates with high Leyshift aptitude.



I must make sure to verify that information...



I wish Da Vinci were more cooperative with our cause.



Olga, what about giving him...

I mean, her, a workshop?



Not yet.



I can't trust a Masterless Servant.



Besides, I can't deal with that Heroic Spirit.



Once we accomplish another summoning,

I'll have her leave immediately.



That's harsh.



I've heard Da Vinci-chan sees you as her little sister.



We should leave Da Vinci in charge of the Heroic Spirit Summoning.



So we can focus in the Masters selection.



Olga, are you done choosing the A-Team?



Yes.



"I recommend these seven magi if an emergency arises."



Those were the orders my father left.



Father ordered to call them Crypters instead of Master candidates.



Director...



What's this?



It doesn't seem like it was made here in Chaldea.



That...



How weird... it was supposed to be under strict security measures.



My apologies.



Is this something important?



Don't worry, we don't use it anymore.



It's one of the presents from the Atlas Institute.



The Atlas Institute?



The ones who provided the blueprint for the TRISMEGISTUS....



...resting at the core of Chaldea? Them?



Yes.



The place where the definitive weapons of the world of magecraft are stored.



The Pit of Taboo... The Atlas Institute.



My father had a deal with Atlas, and based on it, they had to provide us with technology.



That's how we got the Pseudo-Quantum Processor: TRISMEGISTUS.



The other one was that...



The Imaginary Numbers Observation System: PAPER MOON.



PAPER MOON...



A plane moon, perhaps?



It's my first time hearing of it.



So, what does it do?



It's a compass that allows you to demonstrate and observe the Imaginary Numbers realm.



It was prepared as a means to exceed CHALDEAS' phase contrast.



Although, it isn't need anymore.



Because SHEBA was completed and we could accomplish Leyshifting.



I'm surprised.



There is another way to interfere with Singularities besides Leyshifting?



Yes.



By diving into the realm of Imaginary Numbers to later resurface in the appointed location.



We called it Zero Sail.



And the ship that made that possible was the Shadow Border.



Keep the secret.



I get it.



There was a machine unused thanks to me finishing SHEBA.



You got me there.



I can't help but feel that I wasn't really needed.



Lev...?



It's just a thought.



Maybe it's a bit sudden, but that's how things are.



Let's say it took me by surprise.



Olga, I completed the Near-Future Observation Lens SHEBA back in 1999.



That's when I accepted Marisbilly's invitation.



My destiny was determined at that moment.



To save humanity...



No, that's wrong.



To make this planet a better place.



That became the goal of my life.



Before and after this incident.



The future that humans build is versatile and keeps changing.



That's why there's no stability.



Humanity's existence is wonderful, but they carry a big burden.



Wouldn't it be bad if it collapses like a mountain of pebbles?



That's exactly what I want to avoid.



I can't do much by myself.



But, at least I can stop one of those pebbles before crumbling.



What about you?



Do you want to be part of that big burden?



Do you want to carry that burden?



Or maybe you want to keep away those pebbles from your feet.



I...



I'm none of that.



This big duty of preserving the Human Order only brings me anxiety.



I don't give a damn about the future and its importance.



All I have is this obsession to demonstrate that I'm capable of doing it.



Everyday is painful...



Everyday, there's no future...



What will I do once the end comes...?



Is there a way for me to be happy...?



I don't know at all what my purpose should be...



This is so...



Oh, look at the time.



Pardon my discourtesy, but I'll be very busy from now on.



Are you Olga Marie?



My name is Lev Lainur, nice to meet you.



Oh? Without shaking hands?



It's fine, I like that attitude.



It takes time to trust others.



What? I dress weird?



It looks off?



But of course.



I'm the only here who dresses old-fashioned.



It's my pride as a magus trying to display courtesy towards the history of the Animuspheres.



This may be a modern place, but it's also the workshop of the Animuspheres.



So, even if it's only me, it's natural to dress like a magus.



Okay.



Goodbye, Lev Lainur.



Good morning.



Are you in your break too, Senpai?



I see everybody was here.



I'll give you something to drink, what would you like?



Only tea.



Excuse me.



It's not like I'm worried, but you look gloomy.



Is there something bothering you?



It's about my lack of skill.



That's obvious.



You were picked only to fill in numbers.



You aren't a magus nor a soldier.



Just an average joe.



I'd have never given you the chance to fight if you weren't the last remaining candidate.



For you to receive such an important duty as protecting humanity's future is–



Even so...



I can't keep getting saved by everyone else.



First, I must get things done by myself.



And I've been working hard for it...



You...



The more time passes, the more I realise how ordinary I am...



It doesn't matter how much I train, or how many spells I learn...



From time to time, I ask myself...



"Why me? I bet they have someone more qualified."



That kind of unpleasant thought.



Do you believe it was a mistake to become a Master?



You've been doing it reluctantly because there's no one else to do it?



Good...



I should crush him now...



Anyways.



Those who don't even try are those who can't accomplish anything.



If you can't get out of the situation...



At least make yourself stronger.



Even as an ordinary person, I'll be useless if I at least don't show off my mediocrity.



I'm not someone's substitute.



I want to meet everyone's expectations by being myself.



I'm disappointed.



How can we trust the future of humanity to such weakling?



The restoration of Human Order went to your head.



Maybe my judgement was wrong.



Still, we made it this far thanks to you, Director.



We could complete Fuyuki's Order thanks to you.



We were able to eliminate the Singularities in France, Rome and Okeanos...



...because you were our navigator.



I did that with you...?



Mashu, what year is this...?



It's May 1st, 2016.



Director?



Are you feeling bad?



It's nothing.



Thanks, Mashu.



I regret not talking with you like this earlier.



Fujimaru.



Will you keep going in spite of your fear?



Well...



I'm not discouraged enough as to give up.



Is that so?



There's nothing else for me to do, but I'll root for you anyways.



Even if your future gets replaced by something completely hopeless.



By the way...



Who was that?



She's nobody.



She's someone who couldn't reach this future.



Give up.



There's no Human Order to protect anymore.



Listen, drifter who came from a faraway future... no, from the correct history.



You can't win.



The human world will be destroyed.



The future has already been decided.



I knew of someone who said the same...



But, that was just an empty theory.



The future will always be a blank sheet as long as there's someone willing to fight!



I won't let that happen!



You're right.



Because the future literally became a blank sheet.



It would be better if there were something to incinerate, because at least there would be something.



But, this planet even let go of that residue.



Humanity is at a stalemate.



This is the future one year from now that was decided once you stopped the Incineration of the Human Order.



This is how planet Earth looks.



The King of Magecraft once said...



"You would be happier by not doing anything."



Let me repeat those words again.



Our history shall not continue onto the future.



Because... we restored the Human Order...?



Wake up, Fujimaru.



Sorry! I overslept!



Huh...?



I only came to leave my stuff here and I fell asleep...



Even though the whole Chaldea staff is very busy cleaning things up...



Senpai!



I couldn't find you neither in your room nor in the cafeteria...



I was a bit worried.



Did you go to the warehouse?



Yeah.



I was sorting out the sheets and tablewares I used until now.



It doesn't feel right to just throw them away.



Isn't the new staff from the Association arriving soon?



Yes. They will arrive by helicopter once the weather allows it.



Their ship is anchored on the coast.



Really?



We went through a lot in one year, but it was worth it.



Thank you, Mashu.



Thank you for always supporting such a mediocre Master.



I... I should be the one saying it!



I'm conscious I've been supported many times and far longer than Senpai!



The objective of the inspection is obvious.



The old Chaldea will be disbanded and the staff will be renewed.



I wonder if I'll be able to be in the same department as you...



To begin with, will you stay at Chaldea!?



If you're going back to Japan, please give me your address!



I'd like to send you a New Year's greeting card and the like...!



The Inspection Committee will arrive soon...



And with that, my unbelievable days at Chaldea will come to an end.



I don't know what will happen from now on.



It would make me happy to get a job at Chaldea, even if not as a Master.



Though, I know that won't be easy.



But, it doesn't matter what happens.



It doesn't matter how uncertain the future looks.



I believe there's nothing to be afraid of.



Humans are fundamentally powerless, and things rarely work out well.



Usually it's all in vain, and it's normal to just laugh it off saying something like...



"Things like that happen, you know."



I know... that kind of strength was what helped me in this short yet long journey.



For the time being, there must still be things that only I can do.



Let's welcome the New Year without doubting that.
