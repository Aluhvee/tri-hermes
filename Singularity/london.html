My body...is losing...more and more...strength...</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Not only that...</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> All this time...Something&#39;s been...chasing me all this time!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> —I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Huh? Wh-When did you...get in front...of me? O-Oh...</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> ...N-No...Stay away...</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Oooh, no, don&#39;t come near me...I don&#39;t know you...What are you...WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Mom. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> But I want to go home...I want to go home, go home, go home, go home, so...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> We...We really, really...want to go home, okay?</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Eek!

Stop it...Please...Just don&#39;t come...near me!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai.... You&#39;re looking quite pale today.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You couldn&#39;t sleep at all? That&#39;s no good,you must get plenty of rest while you&#39;re in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rest is also an important part of our mission. Like I told you before, we are–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Perhaps...You had...a dream?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I had a scary dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...So you did have a dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What kind of dream was it? It&#39;s just a guess, but...could it be my...Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The dream was like a horror movie.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t really remember.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. That&#39;s good to hear...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No. No, it&#39;s nothing. The meeting&#39;s about to start,so let&#39;s go to the Control Room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;ve had breakfast already, right? Then let&#39;s go, the Doctor is waiting.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good morning, everybody. Good timing. We just finished prepping.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let&#39;s start with the analysis of information from last time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Observing the era of King Solomon, where a summoning spell called the 72 Demon Gods was used, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s right. Let me start with the result...There was nothing wrong with King Solomon&#39;s era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Singularities could not be observed around the 10th century BC. Basically what that means is...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Unfortunately, as Romani says, those who called themselves the 72 Demon Gods had nothing to do with King Solomon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why is that?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, how do I put it...Think of it like a mystery novel,one where the suspect&#39;s alibi stands.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good morning, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, good morning! Someone that can actually greet people! Fujimaru, you&#39;re a fine Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If King Solomon had used the 72 Demon Gods,we definitely would have detected it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Or at least seen signs that he released his 72 Demon Gods toward the future from 10th Century B. C.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But there was nothing unusual during King Solomon&#39;s time. Which means his era remains part of correct human history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Therefore—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Lev Lainur and those calling themselves Demon Gods appeared from a completely different era.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, King Solomon has nothing to do with them. Well, of course—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That&#39;s not the case if King Solomon had been serving someone else as a Servant, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Correct. Like Fujimaru,one can simply use Solomon as a familiar in his own era.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That way, one could also control the &quot;72 Demon Gods. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sigh. Using the 72 Demon Gods as familiars...But that&#39;s assuming those things really existed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Besides, I don&#39;t think King Solomon is the kind of person that would aid such evil.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even if he was so in life...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Servants obey their Masters...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Forgive me, Doctor. But it&#39;s a Servant&#39;s nature to obey their Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As long as it&#39;s the Master&#39;s command, then King Solomon would have no choice but to obey, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Such a villain couldn&#39;t summon Solomon. It&#39;s not like the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Chaldea&#39;s Summoning System comes into effect only if the Master and Heroic Spirit both agree to it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, you do have a point. I came to Chaldea because I agreed to.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The director back then was a fine mage. I agreed to the contract because I could trust them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I told you before, didn&#39;t I? I&#39;m Chaldea&#39;s third successful summon. It&#39;s definitely worth noting!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you&#39;re Servant No. 3?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who was the first?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No. 2 is right in front of you. It&#39;s Mash. As for No. 1, no one knows at this point.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No. 1 and No. 2 are treated as confidential matters. Only the previous director knew the details.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai. The Heroic Spirit who rescued me is No. 2.... Not that I know his True Name or skills.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Director Marie didn&#39;t even know about No. 1, either. The previous director kept all of No. 1&#39;s data under wraps.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Now that I think about it, perhaps the previous director&#39;s death wasn&#39;t an accident, but a murder.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s likely that Lev disliked the successful No. 1—No, the Heroic Spirit Summoning System itself, so much so that he killed the previous director.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, but I think No. 1 ended in failure. Since even Mash&#39;s Heroic Spirit No. 2 ended as an incomplete summon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> For Chaldea, completely successful Heroic Spirit summons started with me, No. 3.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Also, No. 1&#39;s existence itself is suspicious. I think No. 1 may have been summoned by accident.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s because Fate, the Heroic Spirit Summoning System&#39;s foundation, was at long last proven with No. 2&#39;s help and—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ahem! Ms. Leonardo, we&#39;re going to start the Rayshift soon, so would you mind getting it ready?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whoops, a slip of my tongue. Well, that&#39;s it for me♪</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Now, in any case, for the remaining four Singularities...It&#39;s possible the mastermind lurks in one of these eras.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> After all, there are no abnormalities in any other era. If we crush each Singularity, we&#39;ll find the culprit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now let me explain the details of our Order this time. The Fourth Singularity is in the 19th century–</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of the seven, it&#39;s the Singularity closest to modern times. But no need to be surprised.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This is a time when civilizations rise and flourish. In this era, mankind makes huge strides.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> –In other words, the Industrial Revolution! It&#39;s a definitive turning point in mankind&#39;s history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even from the standpoint of a consumer society,this is when mankind makes a huge leap towards modern times.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Your specific destination will be the dazzling, lavish British Empire.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Surprisingly, it&#39;s specific to the capital, London. This differs from the widespread approach of the other Singularities.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Maybe this time, you won&#39;t have to walk yourselves to death. After all, there are carriages and trains.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That is, of course, if you can manage to use them. Since some abnormalities have been detected...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Soon, the Singularity that is 19th century London will be incinerated. It will vanish. You must stop it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Find the Holy Grail,and correct the Fourth Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. So we&#39;ll be working inside the city this time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. Lucky you! London, the city of fog...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If only I could go with you all. Please get Sherlock Holmes&#39;s autograph if you see him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor. This isn&#39;t a vacation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> R-Right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, one more thing. Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m guessing it will be hard to get his autograph. I&#39;m sorry, but please give up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right...Wait, Mash, you too?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Are you a Holmes fan, too? Isn&#39;t he the best? The world&#39;s best detective, the little gray cells!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s Hercule Poirot. He appears in books written by Agatha Christie.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh...Th-That&#39;s right. Okay. Let&#39;s get back on track.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All right, are you ready? The world hasn&#39;t been incinerated yet, so go reclaim our future!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mission...start!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s be cautious this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Unsummon Program, start. Spiritron Conversion, start.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> All procedures cleared. Grand Order, commencing operation.</p><h2 id="section-1-london-the-city-of-demonic-fog" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-london-the-city-of-demonic-fog" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: London, The City of Demonic Fog</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rayshift successful.... It seems we can&#39;t see very well in our current conditions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fog? No, could it be smoke? It&#39;s extremely dense...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In the sky...I can see the same &quot;Circle of Light&quot; as before. But...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...with all this fog and pollution, it&#39;s obscured—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fog and smoke engulfing the sky? That&#39;s fairly common for the Industrial Revolution...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...but this doesn&#39;t look like your typical fog or smoke. I&#39;m picking up an abnormal amount of magical energy readings.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s dense. Very dense. Really dense. No, this may be a little too dense!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s like the atmosphere is saturated with magical energy!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s poisonous to life-forms, this fog...Mash, Fujimaru, how are you feeling?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s nothing wrong with me. Probably because I&#39;m a Demi-Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How about you, Senpai? You don&#39;t seem...any different than usual.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Same as always.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good to hear. But try not to enter that dense fog if you can.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru is okay...Huh. Indeed, there are no significant vital sign changes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m a bit surprised. I have the analysis result of that fog...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m positive it&#39;s harmful to organisms. It would threaten a normal human&#39;s life if they breathed it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mages, monsters, Servants, and Phantasmals have innate magic resistance, so for them it&#39;s a different story...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So of course Mash is fine. But how is Fujimaru all right...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm...I wonder. Maybe it&#39;s a poison-resistance skill?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It could be part of Mash&#39;s benefits, or rather,the benefits of the Heroic Spirit Mash fused with.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Maybe the Servant that fused with Mash has high poison resistance, or a strong blessing skill...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...and its protection extends to the Master. That could be why Fujimaru is safe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m happy to be of use to Senpai,but it seems strange to call it a &quot;skill. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, Fujimaru is human, after all. We&#39;ll call it &quot;Poison Resistance Skill (Temporary),&quot; then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see...&quot;Temporary,&quot; is it...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> For now. London, has turned into a city of death enveloped by a magical fog.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> How does it look around there? Do you see any victims?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, Doctor. It&#39;s completely deserted.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s currently 2: 00 p. m. , but there&#39;s not a single carriage or even a pedestrian in sight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t see any victims. There&#39;s just nobody here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s like an abandoned city...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Also, as far as we can see from the street, all the doors and windows of the buildings are shut tight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> After people started falling victim to the fog,the survivors must have taken refuge indoors...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ve also detected multiple life readings in the surrounding buildings.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re likely survivors. No doubt they&#39;re in trouble being trapped indoors.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We need to solve this problem at once.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s do what we can.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. You&#39;re right, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we obtain and destroy the Holy Grail, the existence of this abnormal London will be corrected too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure that applies to all the residents who lost their lives because of this fog...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and those who are indoors, taking shelter from the fog. Everyone, basically.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If Senpai and I can bring things under control here,all phenomena related to the magical fog should disappear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;ll be as if there were no damage or harm at all. So, um...You see, what I&#39;m trying to say is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash is trying to say: &quot;Senpai is a nice person. &quot; Right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? Um, should I have not said that? Wait, did I say something wrong?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> —Wait a minute. Vital reaction detected.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> ...Who the hell are you guys?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah...Umm, w-we&#39;re, uh—</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> You&#39;re breathing in a place with that dense fog without croaking. You obviously aren&#39;t ordinary humans.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> So, which is it? Friend, or foe?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (I could ask the same question...Doctor, is she human? Or maybe...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (I see, I&#39;m also wondering the same! There&#39;s too much magical energy in the area. I can&#39;t get a clear reading. )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (But look at that armor. She&#39;s definitely not a typical London citizen. )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (I thought things would be easier since we&#39;re limited to a city. )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (This has gotten quite troublesome! We have no clue who or what she is! )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (An ordinary person who happens to have magical resistance? A mage? Or, maybe a Servant—)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can&#39;t tell at all! What do I do!? Argh, I&#39;m so disorientated here!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (I&#39;ve never seen this kind of fog before...Ah, help me, Magi☆Mari!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;London&#39;s fog is worse than rumored. What am I supposed to do? &quot;...There. )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Calm down, Doctor. The situation won&#39;t improve by consulting internet idols! )</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> What are you sneaking around for? If you&#39;re not going to attack, well, whatever.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> I have nothing to do here. Sorry to bother you.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> The fog is dense around here. You&#39;d better move if you value your life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks for the warning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ll do that.</p><hr><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Hmm? Yeah. Well, see you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s gone...The alley to the north...Right into the dense fog, all alone, confident.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, she left during our huddle? She&#39;s so impatient. I wonder if she&#39;s a London girl.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was a &quot;huddle? &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It sounded like she knew what was going on. She probably knows more than us about the current situation in London.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s follow her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Gathering data is important.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. Let&#39;s go after her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I was just about to say that. But then she just had to go and disappear on me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor...Doctor Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, sorry. All right, time to get moving. I&#39;ll keep careful watch!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...What is that? I can hear something.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No vital reactions, but I detect multiple moving bodies! The fog still obscures magical readings, so I can&#39;t get any!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The sound is approaching. It&#39;s close. Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Multiple targets closing in at high speed. Assume they&#39;re hostile. Break through before you&#39;re surrounded!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good judgment will be even more important here—Fujimaru, be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Preparing for battle. Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —We made it through. Somehow we were able to move without being surrounded.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Who knew something like that would be lurking in the fog? No wonder nobody&#39;s emerged from any buildings.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Since no doors or windows seem to be kicked in,that must mean they don&#39;t break into houses, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Strange. They&#39;re really quite strange.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. What bizarre enemies...No, I don&#39;t think they were living creatures.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ll call them enemy bodies for now. They&#39;re likely automata animated by magecraft.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The structure of their remains seems familiar. Some parts are machinery from this era, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I-I see...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I won&#39;t be able to give you any advance warning. All of my magical detection readings are in a state of chaos.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I only have motion detection at best. Hmm, this is quite concerning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I feel the same. It&#39;s just like the city itself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fog, smoke. It&#39;s like there&#39;s a layer of mist around everything...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> At any rate, we have to act more cautiously than before. All right, let&#39;s go after that girl.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...Senpai, let&#39;s go.</p><h2 id="section-2-knight-of-londinium" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-knight-of-londinium" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Knight of Londinium</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Detecting multiple entities!

It could be because they&#39;re mechanical,but I&#39;m positive they&#39;re hostile. Multiple enemies approaching!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger. Master, prepare for battle. Waiting for orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All enemies destroyed. There are none left as far as I can see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can&#39;t detect anything else from here either. Okay, continue on ahead...Wait, hold on.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ve detected a single, large unit. Easy to make out. It&#39;s too large to be human!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I doubt it&#39;s a large vehicle. Mash, do you sense anything?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I can hear machinery operating. It&#39;s large!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It would have been a rather romantic story if Britain&#39;s secret service had arranged for a special vehicle...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...or if this era&#39;s Mage&#39;s Association had sent a mechanical golem to save the citizens of London.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I doubt that&#39;s the case here! It&#39;s clearly an enemy,and it&#39;s approaching you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, be on your guard. It&#39;s probably a new type of enemy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s fight cautiously.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, we just have to take our chances!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Enemy contact now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...All enemy movements have ceased.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was powerful...But what was it, exactly? A golem? A mechanical puppet?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A robot...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks...that way...I guess you could see it that way, yes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It was so cool!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Cool? It looked like a walking tin can to me...Well,I guess the definition of cool is subjective...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s problematic that I can&#39;t detect any magical energy. Mash, are there any enemies remaining?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If any enemy parts are exposed, send me some images. I&#39;ll analyze them when I have the time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. I&#39;ll send the visual data after filming.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s bizarre...This mechanical armor is corroding in some places.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems fine for the most part, but areas that seem to be made of metal have...corroded...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, did we use any acid attacks in the last battle? Wait, do we have any Servants of that sort?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> During the Industrial Revolution in London, massive amounts of smoke emitted from steam engines was a big social problem.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The sulfurous gases in the smoke got caught in the cold fog, retaining and concentrating into a fog of sulfuric acid...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? Is something the matter, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No. Please wait...&quot;Something like inhaling sulfuric acid? &quot; Yes, that&#39;s it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Some records from before...Should be...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. That&#39;s right. I mean, this era—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, behind you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hey, who are you!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Ah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m under attack! An ambush? I didn&#39;t sense anything!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> ...Hey, what are you, exactly? A human? Or a mage?</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> You&#39;re moving unhindered within the magical fog,and you seem just fine within &quot;our fog&quot; as well.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> I guess you&#39;re just like us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So you&#39;re a Servant. You&#39;re supposed to be a human from this era, though...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Jack the Ripper.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An infamous serial killer who not only killed many women in London at the end of the 19th century, but who also dismembered them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and directly challenged Scotland Yard. The symbol of terror that swept across England, no, all of Europe, at the time.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> You know about us? Hmm, that pleases me...How very nice...In that case...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> You&#39;re aware, then, of what we&#39;ll do to you? Oh, I&#39;m so very, very happy!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> I&#39;m so...HAPPY!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s coming at us! Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The motion response is gone. Either they retreated or are hiding within the fog.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Right. That was a dangerous, hostile Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> From the area analysis I did during the battle, a part of this fog is likely from the Noble Phantasm of that Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But the fog of magical energy that covers London is something else entirely.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In short, it was a combination of the two fogs. We&#39;ve got a really difficult opponent on our hands...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The fog contains such a high density of sulfuric acid that there&#39;s no way this is a normal phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Also...And this is the most troubling aspect, Mash...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know. My memory seems to have been altered. We just fought...and yet...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...the memory of my opponent is a blur.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I only remember one thing. It was a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The form, the name, and...There&#39;s some other memory related to it, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm. Seems like the effect can transcend eras. My memory is kind of vague, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> At this rate, the observation record may be distorted,too. What a strange Noble Phantasm it is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Speaking of bizarre—That&#39;s right. Doctor, we, um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We were filming...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about the giant robot from earlier?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! That&#39;s right. We were filming. Senpai, I&#39;m sorry...Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems the effect on your memory is weak, Senpai. Lucky for us!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s right! Yup. Right. I received it. I received image data for a mysterious robot.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m going to proceed in analyzing these images. I wonder what it is?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It doesn&#39;t look like a golem that runs on magical energy,but it also doesn&#39;t look like a complete machine...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, are you versed in mechanical engineering?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m no expert, but I am a member of Chaldea. Albeit as medical staff.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, this is...Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;ve just come across some lost steam engine technology.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Oh, that—?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> It&#39;s just a clump of steel, right? We call it...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> —Helter Skelter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You are–</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> I&#39;ve been watching you. You destroyed one of them,which means you&#39;re probably not my enemy.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Besides, you fought well, not bad. Considering you probably have no idea about the circumstances.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Very nice. I rather like fools like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can I ask you a question?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who are you calling a fool!?</p><hr><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Say what?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right. I&#39;m sure we&#39;re not your enemy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please...Can you give us some information. Will you speak with us?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s happening in this foggy city?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Very well. I&#39;ll talk to you.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> But first, let me get one thing straight. You&#39;re a Demi-Servant, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. My name is Mash Kyrielight. And I am a Demi-Servant.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> And who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Mash Kyrielight and Fujimaru, huh? ...I suppose that&#39;s all right. It has nothing to do with me.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> I am Mordred. A Heroic Spirit. And—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;m a Knight of the Round Table, here to face the perils of Londinium, a city in Father&#39;s beloved Britain.</p><h2 id="section-3-the-demonic-fog-laughs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-the-demonic-fog-laughs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: The Demonic Fog Laughs</h2><p><strong>F：???:</strong> ...Oh boy, Saber. You always reveal your True Name to strangers right away.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> We talked about this. If you&#39;re introducing yourself, just state your class.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Do you understand? Disclosing your True Name is like revealing your abilities.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> That&#39;s the reason we conceal our True Names during normal Holy Grail Wars.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> And yet you give out your True Name at the drop of a hat...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, what&#39;s the difference? This is no longer the &quot;Holy Grail War&quot; that you spoke of.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s not the one with 7 Heroic Spirits, nor the one with 14. On top of that, no Masters. Anyway, do you have any ciders? I am thirsty.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Wait, that&#39;s my favorite sofa...Ah well. Yes, I already got your ciders chilled and ready.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Right, we do have a refrigerator before it became widely used. Being a scholar sure is useful.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Though I have chemicals that need to be stored at low temperatures. It&#39;s necessary for scholars.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Sure, sure.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (...Gulp, gulp gulp) Whew! That&#39;s the stuff. It really hits the spot coming out of that demonic fog!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Mmm—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What are you two doing? Don&#39;t just stand there. Find a place to sit.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> My home is your home. This is my temporary base.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, right...Senpai, what should we do? Is it all right to sit?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I suppose...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You with the glasses...Can I ask you something?</p><hr><p><strong>F：???:</strong> ...Haha. Well, all right, I don&#39;t mind. If Saber trusts you, I&#39;m sure we&#39;re on the same side.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> I haven&#39;t introduced myself yet. I am Henry Jekyll.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I work in London as a scholar— A scientist. Though not officially a mage, I am familiar with elixirs.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> One day, all of a sudden,London was blanketed by this fog. It was a nightmare.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I was able to figure out that the fog contained magical energy, but was at a loss about what to do.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s when we met and started working together.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> He isn&#39;t very reliable as a mage,but comes in handy in his own way.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I provide the muscle. He investigates and analyzes.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um—Excuse me. Mr. Henry Jekyll?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That name, um...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s the same name as a character in a novel. Coincidence? Or perhaps he was the model for that character?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash, can you detect the presence of a Servant? I can&#39;t. You&#39;re inside, but you might as well be outside.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t either, Doctor. I can&#39;t tell if this presence is human or not.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I assure you, I am a genuine human. If it&#39;s a Servant you want, they&#39;re outside, investigating.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> And what were you talking about? A novel?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. A book that was published a little before this era. The main character shares your name.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I don&#39;t recall that. Strange, as I do read my share of novels...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> The same name as the main character? Really? Hmm, I don&#39;t think I could forget that.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Well, let&#39;s set that aside. It is a very common name, after all.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> —As I was saying, I am Henry Jekyll. All I want to do is stop this blight on my hometown.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> But the more important matter at hand is you folks. You&#39;re slightly different from us, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Hmm...Singularity, huh?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> One of seven bolts that were driven into the world. And...the London of this era is that bolt.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. We&#39;re searching for the Holy Grail,which we believe causes the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I understand your situation now, more or less. Now, let me tell you of the city&#39;s circumstances that we&#39;re aware of.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Each night for the past three nights,a lethal fog has descended upon London.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> If you wear a mask in an area where the fog is thin,you probably won&#39;t die from it.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> But it&#39;s no good where it&#39;s thick. Normal creatures will be corrupted by the magical energy just by breathing it.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> It probably depends on one&#39;s predisposition,but in the worst cases, death comes within an hour.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I don&#39;t have the exact numbers, but according to my calculations, several hundred thousand have died.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> There are areas that have become ghost towns already. The East End is just about wiped out.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> It&#39;s only a matter of time before the entire city is nothing but ruins.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> It&#39;s all because of that fog. An extraordinary dense fog laced with potent magical energy—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> For now, we&#39;re calling it Demonic Fog.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> London, covered by a deadly fog...It&#39;s slightly similar to an incident that will occur in the 20th century.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Is it off by a century? That&#39;s probably what the Singularity is...But...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ll look at the 20th century case, too. I had thought this was a one city deal, but it&#39;s getting pretty complicated.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> It&#39;s not just the Demonic Fog. You two should&#39;ve engaged in combat as well.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> These past three days—on top of the Demonic Fog,London has been plagued with other types of threats.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Those committing atrocities under cover of the fog. Automatas made of magecraft, killer homunculi...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Helter Skelter—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> And there&#39;s a serial killer. The newspapers call them &quot;Jack the Ripper. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The newspapers?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Yes, the newspapers were still being printed on the first day of the Demonic Fog...Though no longer.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Understandably, it seems neither Scotland Yard nor the government has a handle on the situation.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Government functions are already starting to freeze up. External support is hindered by the fog, isolating London.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> It&#39;s already been three days. A cooped-up populace won&#39;t last long.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> The Demonic Fog doesn&#39;t go indoors,but once food and water runs out, London will perish.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...That&#39;s horrifying. The situation requires quick response. All right then, Mr. Jekyll and Mordred.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I have a proposal. We&#39;d like you to help us search for the Holy Grail, the likely origin of this situation.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Nothing would suit us better. Right, Saber?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Fine with me. It seems like the best thing to do.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good, this will truly help us! In more ways than one!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So– Mash and Fujimaru,lucky for us, this apartment is over a Leyline!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Excuse me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We can put a Terminal Point here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai and Fou. It&#39;s possible to set up a Summoning Circle in this room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe Mr. Jekyll knew about the Leyline and intentionally built his apartment over it?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Oh, no, I&#39;m not a legitimate mage, so this isn&#39;t a magecraft workshop. It&#39;s just a regular room.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> At any rate, feel free to use it as you please. What are you going to do?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;ll put the Servant summoning circle over the Leyline to boost Fujimaru and Mash&#39;s combat abilities.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Servants summoned by the circle aren&#39;t always active,but they&#39;re a huge help during battles!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All right! Let&#39;s start setting it up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger. Creating Terminal Point—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> While they make the circle,I&#39;ll help you pass the time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Previously, I spoke about Servant class affinity,so I think I&#39;ll expand on that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just as each Heroic Spirit has a story to tell, they have classifications that explain how they were born.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There are three attributes: Heaven, Earth, and Human. Most Servants fall under one of these categories.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Heaven includes Divine Spirits demoted to Heroic Spirits,children of gods, and embodiments of legends.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Earth includes legendary heroes that took hold in the land, fairies, and Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Human is for heroes and great people who actually existed. I&#39;m included in this group, as a great artist who actually existed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Heaven wins over Earth, but loses to Human. Earth wins over Human, but loses to Heaven.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And Human wins over Heaven, but loses to Earth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Humans believe in gods. However,gods that they stop believing in become &quot;nonexistent. &quot;</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Native heroes and fairies have nothing to do with faith. However, they are no match for the gods that created them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...And there are rare, special Heroic Spirits that do not belong in any of the three attributes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They are an exception of exceptions. –The Heroic Spirits of the Star.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They do not belong to Heaven, Earth, or Human. Yet they exist on earth under heaven, and are born of humans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Servants of the Star have nothing to do with Heaven,Earth, or Humans. After all, they&#39;re an exception.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That said, these are nothing more than categories.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The effects aren&#39;t as pronounced as Class affinity,so it&#39;s not worth integrating into a strategy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...And that wraps up this session. Summoning circle setup complete. Good luck in this era, too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Thank you, Da Vinci, thank you! Thank you yet again!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Who was that just now? She was beautiful,but...She wasn&#39;t actually here, was she?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fouuu!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Mmm. I remember seeing him somewhere before. Phantasmal?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> F-Fouuuu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Perhaps a rare animal from around Africa? Anyway,Saber, and this concerns Mash and Fujimaru, too.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> This is abrupt–but I would like to ask you three to do something.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We just got back and we have to go out into the Demonic Fog again? Good grief.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I apologize for asking you to lead the way. It&#39;s just that we&#39;re not used to London yet.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s fine. Don&#39;t worry. If you guys hadn&#39;t come here,this work would&#39;ve had to be all mine.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If anything, I should be thanking you. Sorry for making you come along based on vague information.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, no, Mordred. Not at all...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Protecting one of Mr. Jekyll&#39;s other collaborators,the Swiss scholar Mr. Frankenstein, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Seems he&#39;s been unreachable since this morning. Do you normally communicate with each other via radio?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Jekyll does. He calls it his information network. I don&#39;t really understand it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> He has collaborators all over the city and chats with them on the radio every day.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Old man Victor was safe until yesterday at least.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Victor Frankenstein, huh...Just when we thought it&#39;s another character from a novel, it turns out to be his &quot;relative. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The grandchild of the mage that became the model character in the novel, was what Mr. Jekyll mentioned.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Unexpected, indeed. In Mary Shelly&#39;s novel...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Dr. Frankenstein was a scientist. But the person he was modeled after was a real-life mage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It brings to mind that idiom about how &quot;truth is stranger than fiction&quot;.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is it that strange?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are scientists and mages really that different?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Strictly speaking,magecraft and science are contrary to each other.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Chaldea&#39;s existence is an extreme exception, and if you think about it, both globally and historically—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh yes, but everything has an exception. In a certain era,science and magecraft virtually meant the same thing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> For example, even if you set aside ancient times,some will say alchemy is the origin of chemistry.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There are numerous examples of mages who are known as renowned scientists, chemists, and scholars.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You know,Da Vinci is one such example.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mmm. You called?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re talking about science and magecraft. I&#39;m no help there. After all...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m almighty. You can&#39;t compare me to anyone. Too bad. Bye.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! We lost the connection.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s with her, anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Da Vinci is way too carefree...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We&#39;re near Soho. Keep your guard up now. They&#39;ll be here soon.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The edge of the City Area where Jekyll&#39;s apartment is seems relatively peaceful in comparison.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> This area is no good. We&#39;re in their territory.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So it appears. I&#39;m picking up multiple motion signals. It&#39;ll be a fight, so watch out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Damn. They&#39;re coming again. I wish I could unleash my Noble Phantasm at will.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re inside the city. I&#39;m sorry, but you must get your temper under control.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I know that, Shieldy. Ugh, somehow I feel weird when you tell me that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hold on. &quot;Shieldy? &quot;Are you referring to me?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh? You have a shield, don&#39;t you? You use it to defend and bash people in the face.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Or, does &quot;Ms. Shieldy&quot; sound better? I don&#39;t care which one you pick.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That&#39;s okay. Just call me &quot;Shieldy,&quot; please...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The enemy is trying to flank us from both sides. Can you take care of the right side, Saber Mordred?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Leave it to me. I usually deal with everything by myself.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Are you ready over there, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m ready!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Strike foes from the left!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger. Entering battle with hostiles!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I, um...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What? Speak up. If you have something to say, just say it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right, then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have a question for you. Why are you fighting here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mr. Jekyll is fighting to protect his hometown. But what about you—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I already told you, didn&#39;t I? I&#39;m here to face the perils of Father&#39;s beloved Londinium.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, sure...I mean...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I did hear that when we first met. I understand that, really, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hope you won&#39;t get upset, but for some reason,I...I feel like...it&#39;s for a different reason.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Jeez.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right. I didn&#39;t even tell Jekyll about this, you know?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I just—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. I just can&#39;t allow the land of Britain to be violated by someone other than me.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;m the only one allowed to violate the land King Arthur loved. I can&#39;t let anyone else do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So distorted...</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hm? Did you say something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, not at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not particularly.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If you want to say something, say it. Well, anyway...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I will give you the Holy Grail once we find it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I won&#39;t say &quot;I want it after all&quot; or anything. And even if I did, it wouldn&#39;t serve any purpose.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;m Mordred, the Treacherous Knight. But this time it&#39;s special, and I&#39;ll be on the defender&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Honestly, I was hesitating a bit. Meeting you guys cleared up my mind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I mean, someone worthy of being the owner finally showed up. You can have the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Enough chitchat. Don&#39;t bring up this topic ever again.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We&#39;re almost at the mansion, but enemies are here again. Well then, shall we rip them apart?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mordred&#39;s detection is amazing. Is it an Intuition skill? We detected hostile reactions too. There&#39;ll be three waves!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger. Master, orders please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right, we&#39;re here. This big building is Victor&#39;s mansion.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Unlike Jekyll who&#39;s half-assed,he is a genuine mage, so be careful.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Traps like barriers and such are set up all over, so even Servants get hurt if they touch things without knowing.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> When I first visited to check things out,I had an absolutely terrible experience here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, okay. I&#39;ll be careful, then.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A death trap workshop in an urban area...Sounds like a cautious old guy with pretty strong nerves.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The first challenge is the entrance door. See, look at that big door—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Damn, we&#39;re too late.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Someone is at the entrance...A tall silhouette...A clown?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, you! Scarecrow! Or are you a living statue? Whatever! Anyway...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...you stink like hell. It&#39;s like blood, guts, and fire.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And the catalyst for the old man&#39;s favorite elemental spell? I can smell it from here!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You killed him, didn&#39;t you. You murdered Victor Frankenstein.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Yes, I did—Well, no, let me see. Just a moment, please.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Indeed, indeed. That elderly man will not open his mouth, brush his teeth, eat food, or breathe ever again.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Yes, yes. Frankly speaking, I&#39;m certain he is dead.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s a shame. He refused to join our cause. Right till the very end.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But, and yet, however. Who killed Victor Frankenstein?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That might be quite a difficult question to answer. Because he &quot;blew himself up. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, my. Did I scare the beautiful young lady?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My apologies. As you can see, I am a demon after all—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That was a joke, and I&#39;m sorry for letting you down,but I&#39;m actually a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m a Servant just like you. The class is Caster.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Oh? Well, folks, you don&#39;t get it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s enough. Shut up.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> No, I&#39;m sure you got that. You wonder why I revealed my class so easily?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It is reasonable during a Holy Grail War unlike any other. At least that lady over there knows why!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> An encounter instantly becomes an all-out battle! As we are Servants without Masters—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> We can be called the most powerful forces on the earth. However...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Sadly, it seems that you have a Master. Best you protect yourself well. Otherwise, in no time...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Enough small talk. And wipe that grin off your face right now.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Pardon?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That smirk of a smile! So annoying! Was it really that fun to kill that old man?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, sure—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Once he rejected our cause,it was like a job to me, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Cause?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> When you are obligated to do something,it&#39;s usually quite a nuisance, indeed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But still, it feels good to do your best. You will work hard for a job you enjoy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> His expression in the moment he died. The face of a human who understood the transition from life to death!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Despair! Sorrow! Ah! That is exactly it—!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, anyway, something like that—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It killed my boredom? At least, I guess?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Immigrant or not, that old man was a citizen of Britain. Listen, you took him...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You put your hand on &quot;my stuff&quot; without my permission. You know what will happen?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> —What?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —I&#39;m saying, I&#39;m going to kill you, dumb-ass clown!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, well, well! You? Killing me? Can you, really?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You seem to be a hot-blooded person! Good, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll try not to disappoint you then!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You might as well watch out for the explosions! My Noble Phantasm has already been set up!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> By my True Name, Mephistopheles! I shall relish striking you all down into despair!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;ve set up what!? Dammit! I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the fog or his skill, but it&#39;s undetectable!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, hostile Servant approaching! Orders, please—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Get him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Fight and watch out for his Noble Phantasm!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Roger!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> This is quite...regretful! This materialization was one I couldn&#39;t enjoy much of...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I suppose Servants need Masters after all...Yes, the power of the bond between Master and Servant...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Something of it...Not. Yes, definitely not.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Once a Master decides to fulfill an earnest wish, I must make at least one child must die by the Master&#39;s hand.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Otherwise you can&#39;t enjoy the best part of a Holy Grail War. Oh, I envy you, Shield Servant...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> You will have countless chances from here onwards...to betray and throw your Master into despair!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I am so...jealous of you!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Shut up.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Did you find anything?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I found the note the doctor left. Apparently, he was writing this when he was attacked.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I see. I must say, he was a lax old guy until the end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;ll read it out loud.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> &quot;I learned of a certain plot. Its name is &#39;Project Demonic Fog. &#39; Though its present state is still unknown,&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> &quot;The three leaders of the project are &#39;P&#39;, &#39;B&#39; and &#39;M&#39;, who can cast spells beyond human wisdom. Probably Heroic Spirits. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Is &quot;M&quot; the guy from earlier? Well, let&#39;s take this back and have Jekyll read it, too.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And now...I&#39;ve found something interesting, too.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, come over here.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong> ...Uh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...A girl?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She has a horn.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, she does have a horn...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is she human? Or a Servant?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Who knows? It would be the best if we ask her.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you a human? Or are you a Servant just like us?</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong> ...Uhh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, I can&#39;t determine what she is...All I can read is that there are vital and physical reactions.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It seems the detection issues caused by the Demonic Fog can reach indoors, too. How about you, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t figure it out, either. How about you, Mordred?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I can&#39;t tell for sure by just her presence. I think the Demonic Fog outside is interrupting.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But, you&#39;re asking what she is? Of course she&#39;s a Servant—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> At least I wish I could say that.... In my memory, that&#39;s how it was supposed to be...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Anyway, yes. She is an artificial human. Apparently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An artificial human—is she?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I found her in the coffin in the backroom,and a note was attached. Let me see...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> First artificial human created by Grandfather Victor Frankenstein, or something like that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So it is Frankenstein&#39;s monster. But didn&#39;t it burn up in the end according to the novel?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I wonder if she can hear my voice. Let&#39;s see...Are you Frankenstein&#39;s monster?</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong> ...Uhh, ah...uuuh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems like she doesn&#39;t have a speech function. But I can somehow understand her.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Name, I guess. Monster—is certainly a name you don&#39;t like, right?</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong> ...Uhh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then, how about Fran?</p><hr><p><strong>H：???:</strong> ...Uh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, she seems to be happy with the name. Okay then, Ms. Fran.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You are an artificial human...Is that correct?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You&#39;re not a Servant, huh. Oh, I get it. You mean, &quot;you&#39;re still alive. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I finally understand. No wonder I couldn&#39;t figure it out just by looking at you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, never mind.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We can&#39;t just leave her here,so let&#39;s take her back to Jekyll.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Your master is no longer here. You can go anywhere you want.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;ll let you stay with Jekyll for now. Let&#39;s go. The fog shouldn&#39;t impact you if you&#39;re an artificial human.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is she...really? I&#39;m not so sure about that. That&#39;s a dangerous action.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> She&#39;s going to be fine! She&#39;s not breathing. Right, Fran?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> See. She&#39;s nodding.</p><h2 id="section-4-one-book-one-pen" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-one-book-one-pen" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: One Book, One Pen</h2><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> This girl—yes, Fran is an artificial human. Her physical composition was not of a spirit. She&#39;s not a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> She is a human living in this era. Wait, I guess artificial human.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Maybe the description in the novel was wrong...Though I can&#39;t be that positive about it.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh...Uh...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, well...She&#39;s just...I mean... How can I say this...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You touched around her body insisting it was an inspection, and it made her unhappy. Apologize to her, Jekyll.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Oh. I&#39;m very sorry. How shameful of me. That was unacceptable from an English gentleman.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s fine, as long as you understand...That was the nuance in her voice...I think.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Most likely.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s what she said.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How are you guys understanding her?</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> How do you guys know what she thinks? Is it because you&#39;re the &quot;same gender&quot;...Oh, no, nothing!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Next time, I will kill you.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Yes. Yup. Sorry. I&#39;ll never say it again. Anyway—another case showed up in my info network.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Something strange appeared in the Soho area. Apparently it even slips indoors to assault civilians.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let me confirm. The homunculi, automata,and Helter Skelters until now—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Have zero cases of entering buildings. At least not according to my information network and Saber&#39;s patrols.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> What is entering buildings and attacking civilians appears to be a book as big as a human.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I decided to tentatively call them Magical Tomes. I want you to deal with this.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Whether this is related to &quot;Project Demonic Fog&quot; is uncertain, but at the very least, there have been victims in Soho.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I need your help. Will you do it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Leave it to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s no use staying still.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree, Master. We&#39;re some of the few able to go outdoors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I will try my best to be of help to you, Senpai. Rather, it would make me happy...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What are you talking about? Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a Demi or whatever, you&#39;re still a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Oh, I mean...Well, just forget it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Master-Servant relationships are case-by-case. It&#39;s not something I should interfere with.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Now, shall we? I don&#39;t know if Fran can be useful, so she&#39;ll stay here.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh......Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What, are you lonely? Just be a good girl and wait. We&#39;ll be right back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s dangerous outside. Let&#39;s talk again when we come back.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huge book...A Magical Tome, huh? A kind of monster that didn&#39;t exist in Britain back in my day.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Britain when you were alive...Did monsters exist back in the times of the Arthurian legends?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Of course. The Knights of the Round Table even fought dragons and giants.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Deep woods, steep mountains, bluffs with unceasing winds. Realms humans never cross are prime dens for Phantasmals.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> They come down to human dwellings every so often. And well, ordinary humans usually end up as their food.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Food, you say.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Average soldiers are no match for demonic beasts,dragons, or Phantasmals. Even in your era, most weapons are useless.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But there are exceptions. For Britain—it was the Knights of the Round Table.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We fought well, and killed a reasonable number,you know? Battling a Phantasmal is pretty rough—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, and them. Them...The Picts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In our time, they&#39;re seen as a very mysterious people. A tribe that once flourished mainly in Scotland, so we&#39;ve heard.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well, rather than people, they were...Um...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> They weren&#39;t like any tribes or barbarians...They went far beyond any of them.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Describing it in terms of your era, they were like something that would be in a sci-fi movie, you know?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Aliens? Or, something like that. Yes, that&#39;s a close one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An Arthurian joke?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Ah, that&#39;s a funny joke.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. I heard it as a joke, too.... Oh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mordred, I...I&#39;m sorry. I completely missed the timing to laugh.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, that was an Arthurian joke? So you&#39;re supposed to miss the timing...Hm, I see.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Joke? No, I wasn&#39;t joking at all—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wait, I sense enemies. Most of them are automatas.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s a battle. Master, your orders please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Crushed the dolls. There.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But—What is this sort of thing even called?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> In Asia they have a term for it, don&#39;t they? &quot;En&quot; or something. It&#39;s like fate?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Gathering all sorts of Heroic Spirits and making them your allies—That&#39;s not something you can achieve easily.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But well, if that&#39;s the way you&#39;re using the summons I guess it&#39;s possible.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> This method should indeed make Heroic Spirit summons easier. I can imagine who it was that suggested it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> To be honest, it feels strange to me......But that, I suppose, is also fate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is Mordred talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is it about the summoning system?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...It seems so, anyways. Are you talking about the Heroic Spirit Summoning System?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...Mordred, do you know much about Heroic Spirit summons? Like you&#39;re a Saber with magecraft knowledge?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What did you just say, Shieldy? Do I have magecraft knowledge? Are you being sarcastic or...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Wait, that&#39;s not what you meant, huh. Argh, you&#39;re such a pain in the ass, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes...! I don&#39;t know why I just got scolded,but in any case I&#39;m very sorry!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;m not scolding, it&#39;s just a complaint! That&#39;s another thing you two have in common!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> &quot;You two? &quot;</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Forget it. That was a slip of the tongue. Don&#39;t probe any further, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Touchy, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Of course, I am. Being cranky is my default mode. It&#39;s &#39;cause I&#39;m a mass killer, as far from a saint as one can be.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You guys are the ones that are getting too close in the first place. People are normally scared of me, being the Treacherous Knight and all.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Tch! Look, you guys aren&#39;t the problem here, okay? It&#39;s my own nature that&#39;s the problem.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So don&#39;t misunderstand me. It&#39;s not that I hate either Mash or Fujimaru. I don&#39;t hate you, that&#39;s not it, but—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I can&#39;t help myself. Come on, let&#39;s fight. Get that shield up. I&#39;ll batter it to pieces.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You ARE upset!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Treacherous Berserker!</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah, insult me all you want. I&#39;m used to it. Feels better than awkward compliments.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I won&#39;t let Mash engage in needless battles.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> To fight Mash, go through me first</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, so you CAN act like a Master. Though it would&#39;ve looked a lot cooler if your knees weren&#39;t shaking, you know?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The weak should act like one and stay back. Because they meddle in things like that, they&#39;re the first to die, yeah?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —! Master, get back! Mordred is serious!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You parried my first attack! How cheeky! You&#39;re finally learning how to use that thing the way you should!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s good. Here goes, Shieldy! You must always be one step ahead of your own limit to protect your allies!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If you&#39;re gonna use that Noble Phantasm, put some spirit in it! As an experienced Servant, I will train you thoroughly!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hah...Ah...Ugh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sen...pai— Thank goodness. Were you watching?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Battle...is over—I...was able to parry...Mordred&#39;s attacks—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mordred!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oof...Don&#39;t glare at me like that. I regret that I went a little overboard. You seriously look scary right now.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, that was a mock fight. Mash was fully aware of that too.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So, how was it, Mash? Figured out how to use that Noble Phantasm at least a little bit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...Thank you...Very much...Somehow, it feels—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...like a shackle on my heart was removed...That was the toughest I&#39;ve felt since Cú Chulainn&#39;s spells...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then perhaps...that just now was?</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Well, drastic times call for drastic measures.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> She was holding herself back by calling herself a Demi-Servant.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I pulled a stunt here to hammer into her what her role was. She&#39;ll be a bit more decent from now on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mordred...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You look after others well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Even so, a bit too rough...</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Shut up. You guys drop your guard way too much and it was pissing me off, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s not like me to teach swordsmanship to others. In fact, this was my first time. Damn you!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Listen. Not a word of this to Jekyll. He&#39;ll interrogate me again.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And sorry, Fujimaru. I apologize for disrespecting you. You are indeed weak, but it&#39;s a practical kind of weak.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You&#39;re no coward nor scoundrel. You&#39;re an idiot worth carrying, in your own way. Right, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, definitely! After all, Senpai is the best Master in Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Best in Chaldea is saying too much...</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Okay, okay, enough already. This is so sweet I&#39;m getting indigestion.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right, time to hurry onward, Fujimaru,Mash. Keep that shield at the ready and follow me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay! Thank you very much, kind Sir Mordred!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> D-Don&#39;t suddenly start calling me &quot;Sir Mordred,&quot; dummy! You&#39;re gonna make me trip!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All hostile units eliminated...Complete silence confirmed. Good work, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good work. I received a transmission from Jekyll, so I&#39;ll connect you.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Can you hear me? I have supplemental information to pass on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh—I see. They took the radio transmission from Jekyll and patched it through via Dr. Roman&#39;s channel.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Right. Chaldea&#39;s technology is marvelous. But let me cut to the chase. It&#39;s about the Magical Tome running amok in Soho.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Unlike killer homunculi or automatas, the Magical Tome can get past closed doors and into buildings. That we know.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> We have specifics on the damage now. They say it puts people into an unending slumber.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Through magecraft? Or a drug?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> We don&#39;t know yet. If it&#39;s just a drug, it shouldn&#39;t pose any issue for you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I don&#39;t think that would affect us. Senpai has Poison Resistance Skill (Temporary), too.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I see, that&#39;s good. But well, nothing beats good, old-fashioned vigilance.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If it is magecraft, in my case, my Magic Resistance Skill nullifies most effects on me—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But I can&#39;t block a direct hit of, say, a drug made by a Servant&#39;s skill or Noble Phantasm at high magecraft levels.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s be really careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s okay if it doesn&#39;t hit us.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well, yeah. Just act carefully.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Once you&#39;ve arrived in the Soho area,stop by the antique bookshop I specified first.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> There should be an informant there. That is,if they haven&#39;t been attacked by Magical Tomes yet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Then let&#39;s get going. Soho&#39;s not far off now.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> ...So you&#39;ve finally come. I was getting pretty sick of waiting, you idiots.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> Thanks to you, I&#39;ve ended up reading an entire novel series, roughly 20 volumes, that I didn&#39;t even want to read.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who&#39;s this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A child?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> You&#39;re the rescue team Mr. Henry Jekyll said was coming? Then, let me quickly fill you in on the situation here.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh? Wait, so the informant he mentioned is this brat?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This boy, as it were. He must have some relation to this antique bookshop.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe he&#39;s the shopkeeper&#39;s son or relative...or grandson. Is that correct?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re the one who contacted Mr. Jekyll,and are seeking help from us, right?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. The situation being what it is,a rough understanding is fine for now.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You kind of...have a really nice voice. Is your voice changing right now?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> Yeah, I&#39;ve always wanted to be in theaters.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> So embarrassing. Nothing more embarrassing than a life where you couldn&#39;t achieve what you want!</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> Well, we&#39;ll put talk of my beautiful voice aside. I&#39;ll be talking your ears off from here, anyway.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> For now, let&#39;s talk about &quot;this place. &quot; The Magical Tome already assaulted the elderly shopkeeper here.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> Nearly half of Soho&#39;s people met the same fate. They&#39;ve fallen into unending slumber, and now dream merrily together.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Do you know where the Magical Tome is now? Also, how did you manage to escape its attack?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> Huh? Are you stupid? Is your brain, not just your voice,in la-la land? Obviously, I ran away from it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? ...Oh! Um, s-sorry...Of course...That makes perfect sense...Ha, ha, sorry...I apologize...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ha, ha...Ha, ha, ha...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, please don&#39;t get hurt by a child&#39;s words. Kids that age tend to speak very bluntly.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> So, you asked where the Magical Tome is. Right here.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> It&#39;s on the 2nd floor residence of the bookshop...In other words, still on this floor, in the study next door.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Haha! Well, well! So it&#39;s right there?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, indoor combat is dangerous. We should avoid combat in narrow, enclosed spaces if we can.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There is a chance that you and the boy would get caught up in the fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then let&#39;s fight in an open space.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Lure it outside!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...All right. Mordred, if you will.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s get this over with!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Dammit, I know the attacks are hitting, but they&#39;re not getting through! What&#39;s with this book?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t get it either. Our attacks are landing, but it&#39;s not going down!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmmm are you sure it&#39;s not an illusion? And are you sure your attacks are hitting?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Doctor. We have no status anomalies.</p><p><strong>Magical Tome:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Tch, floating around like that! So cheeky for a book, are you missing pages or something!?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> More like a banned book. If the contents are true, then even as a book it can kill people...Or so the story goes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The boy from earlier...You shouldn&#39;t come out! It&#39;s dangerous! Go back!</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> Keep watching the Magical Tome, miss. Don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;ll take off as soon as I say what needs to be said.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You...I thought you had a good voice, but I never thought.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Are you by chance a Servant? Damn, this fog is clouding my intuition!</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> You finally noticed. Yes, I&#39;m a Heroic Spirit like you. Or rather—</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> Did you think a kid reading rare books so calmly in a time like this is normal?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> The ability to detect magical energy aside, your intuition as a reader is abysmal, Saber. You should read more.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> I recommend the series in shelf E on the 1st floor. They&#39;re full of dreams, adventures, and bad endings you might like.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey—who the hell are you! You sure know how to jok—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Andersen. Hans Christian Andersen.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> My class is Caster. If you want to know the details, read one of my books.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What? What? —Whaaat!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hans Christian Andersen, the author– Amazing...He&#39;s one of the top three fairy tale authors in the world, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Calm down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you like fairy tales?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, no...Well...I wouldn&#39;t say I love them,but I have read quite a few of them.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Oh. You don&#39;t have to hide it, it&#39;s obvious! You&#39;re an avid reader! I have an avid reader among Servants!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> First characters from fictional novels,now an actual author! And, our enemy is a book!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, it&#39;s turning into another confusing situation, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So how&#39;s Mr. Andersen? Is he amazing as a Servant!?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Huh? What does that bonehead expect? I&#39;m an author. Of course I&#39;m absolutely powerless.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s neat to encounter a Magical Tome that attacks people, but it&#39;s literally impossible for me to defeat it alone.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> So, here I am, waiting for Servants fit for physical labor to show up!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Now go fight, Saber and Ms. Avid Reader! I&#39;ll keep detailed notes of the entire affair!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Mmm, kyuu! Kyaau!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Shut up, please shut up! I feel like killing you before the Magical Tome!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What? Not only do you lack intelligence to study the Magical Tome, you can&#39;t make distinctions between friend and foe?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Amazing. An extreme barbarian! You know,your head must be filled with mashed potatoes!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Move aside, Shieldy! I&#39;m going to beat the crap out of that punk first!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know how you feel but calm down! Mr. Andersen, please say something to her, too!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Say something? Oh, something beneficial. Hmm. Well then, here&#39;s a lecture.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> You have experienced the nature of the Magical Tome,yes? Attacks are ineffective. Of course they are.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s because you think it&#39;s a book. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a type of Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Reality Marble!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Reality Marble?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> As I recall, that&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s a type of powerful magecraft that rewrites how the world exists. They say it&#39;s almost equivalent to True Magic.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rarely, there are cases when a Servant materialized uses it as their Noble Phantasm—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Right, maybe a Reality Marble affects the space it&#39;s in. But that&#39;s different. Its existence itself is a Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> That&#39;s why it has endurance near invincibility. It effectively utilizes the fact it is a Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Then, why is that possible? Good. That&#39;s a natural question.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> But figure out that much on your own! There&#39;s plenty of food for thought, anyone can make sense of it in minutes!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But we don&#39;t have those few minutes! State the conclusion! The conclusion!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s floating right now,but we don&#39;t know when it will attack again!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> How hasty...Do you start books at the ending? Oh, fine. Out of respect for the avid reader, I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> My reason by analogy is that it originally was a Servant that projects the psyche of its Master.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s easy if you elicit from dramaturgy. Though, I needed to ponder for about an hour.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You took your sweet time! Enough! State the conclusion! The conclusion!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> The conclusion, or rather, the problem is before you. This is a &quot;stray. &quot; There is no Master.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> That&#39;s why it attacked the people in Soho. It put them to sleep and made them dream.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> In short, it&#39;s searching for a Master. To manifest the dream, it&#39;s &quot;trying to materialize&quot; as a Pseudo-Servant.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I see! So the guise of this Magical Tome has no substance!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Good answer! It&#39;s not even a Servant. It&#39;s a clump of magical energy that wants to be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It will materialize eventually if left alone. In return, every citizen of Soho will fall asleep.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Compared to the fog of magical energy drifting outside,the damage may not be as vicious.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> However.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Some may become emaciated and die while asleep,but perhaps nobody will die.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> To begin with, if sleep takes so much of one&#39;s time,we writers would go out of business!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> So, it will be defeated. Soho has many bookstores, both new and used.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You contradict yourself, Mr. Andersen! You just said it has no substance so we can&#39;t defeat—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I mean, you can&#39;t look for a book without a title. It&#39;s easy to give substance to a story.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Can you hear me? I&#39;ll give you a name, Magical Tome, no—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> —A Tale for Someone, Nursery Rhyme!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You can do things when you actually try, punk! But why didn&#39;t you do anything until now!?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Idiot, if I gave it substance, it would attack me, too. Just saying, I&#39;m very weak in fistfights.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I told you I had no choice but to hold my breath and read books until you guys, the physical labor, showed up.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...Nursery...Rhyme...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> No, it&#39;s not. That&#39;s not &quot;my&quot; name, &quot;my&quot; name is Alice.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Mmm? Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Something...is a bit off from Mr. Andersen&#39;s predictions...But, Senpai, this is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s materializing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> All&#39;s well that ends well!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, the enemy is materializing! Now I can clearly discern its form!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right. Let&#39;s do it! Afterwards, I&#39;m gonna choke that punk!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Alice, where are you? Alice isn&#39;t...here...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Hey, big sisters. Where is the lonely &quot;me? &quot;</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...You don&#39;t have a Master. No, to be exact, she probably is not in this era.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...I can&#39;t believe there was a Master who loved a book without a title this much.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> This is what you call painful to watch. I&#39;m sorry, but please defeat it quickly.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...All bark and no bite. I was expecting at least a reproduction of Wonderland.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I guess that was expecting too much. It didn&#39;t help that we were too powerful.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Hey. What was that about us being too powerful, punk?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Not only did you stand there like a damn statue,I think all you ever did was run your mouth and insult us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> P-Please, let&#39;s stop it, Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He has a sharp tongue for sure, but we were able to defeat the Magical Tome—Nursery Rhyme thanks to him!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! Foou!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Tch...You&#39;re right. I know. It&#39;s my loss if I meddle with people of this sort.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What, contrary to your looks...Wait, maybe you do have that look...Wait, maybe not after all. Your soul is like a Morning Star!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Morning Star, like a flail? So I&#39;m thorny, huh? Dammit! I hate to admit it but you make a good point!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...Good reaction...With training, you might be easy prey...Excuse me, a good reader. What a waste.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> But to think I&#39;d be defended from a hater by an avid reader. Humans never change regardless of era.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Both Mash and I are Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. But I was originally a human...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> More like,most Servants were originally humans.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Tch. Oh well. That thing didn&#39;t seem like it used to be human, though.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fou...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Right, most of Heroic Spirits were humans,but sometimes there are cases like Nursery Rhyme.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Cases where a human creation gains its own will, or gathers visions from people to become a &quot;Conceptual Heroic Spirit. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Those are rare, though. Someday, there might even be Heroic Spirits of machines as well as books.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyway, thank you for all your work. Go back to Jekyll&#39;s apartment for now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Andersen, can you come, too? It&#39;s most reassuring to have more Servants as allies.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What?! We&#39;re taking this punk with us?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> He&#39;s super weak. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be useless! He&#39;s so boring, too! I&#39;m sure he won&#39;t write any decent books!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> —I see. Okay, I&#39;m happy to go with you.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I had no intention of helping you,but that last statement changed my mind.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> My pleasure, Saber. No, Sir Mordred. By the way, if you are to be a protagonist, what&#39;s your favorite genre?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> A tragedy? A farce? Or a comedy? Splendid. I&#39;ll polish it into the best trashy tale ever.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I see. Why don&#39;t you go write some unpopular books and cry in a corner, fairy tale author.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Um, excuse me, that&#39;s rude, he can hear that)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I wanted him to hear it. Only a coward talks behind one&#39;s back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Well, let&#39;s move. Let&#39;s leave before the antique bookshop&#39;s owner wakes up.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Because I&#39;m also a thief. Actually, I snuck in from the back door.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;d be awkward if he woke up and called the cops. Getting arrested despite helping is going too far for a trashy book!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You entered without permission,and still acted that confidently!?</p><h2 id="section-5-helter-skelter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-helter-skelter" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Helter Skelter</h2><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> My, what a lovely little hideout. I like it. I&#39;ll take the study next door.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I&#39;ll be unpacking, so call me if you need me. Oh, and don&#39;t forget to knock.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Wow, I&#39;m so tired. That baggage made me double tired. No, triple tired!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> She&#39;s wrecking my personal sofa again...I&#39;d prefer you use the one for guests...Oh, never mind.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Just stay there and listen. Mash, you and Fujimaru too.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Jack the Ripper is back. And this time they&#39;re not murdering women in the fog.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> They&#39;re currently putting Scotland Yard under siege. I&#39;m picking up calls for help from stations all over London.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That guy! That bastard finally came out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sounds like a grudge.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> An acquaintance?</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah. A Servant of Assassin class. We fought a few times in the fog...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Escapes every time. I can&#39;t quite finish &#39;em off. They escape into the fog!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> On top of that, I can&#39;t remember a face, figure, or specific abilities! It pisses me off!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Every time I hear &quot;Jack the Ripper,&quot;all I can do is think, &quot;Oh yeah, that Assassin! &quot;</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Dammit! It&#39;s so frustrating! That stupid little—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> You may have had an encounter as well. How about it? Do you remember fighting &quot;an Assassin? &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I think I do...I think it was an Assassin. We...were ambushed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right...We were ambushed. My memories suddenly came back to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I couldn&#39;t remember most of the details until now. But, if it&#39;s a Servant, we can guess why—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A skill?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A Noble Phantasm?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. That&#39;s right. It&#39;s due to either a skill or a Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> They&#39;re fast. We should hurry before they get away. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What, stepping out? Then say so. Bring me back...I know! Some scones would be great.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You&#39;re not coming!? No, you wouldn&#39;t be useful if you did...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Wait. Can you make them easier to beat, like that last one?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> The last one was an extreme exception. Don&#39;t count on it. What do you expect an author to do to begin with?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Do you think authors are all-powerful, omniscient gods? Then you need to learn better.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Listen to me. Authors are just fools who fled to the pen when reality wouldn&#39;t go their way.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Do you really think I can help you with anything?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...I was stupid for asking. Let&#39;s go, Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We&#39;ll go as fast as we can. Mash, carry Fujimaru. It&#39;s a race against time.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We can&#39;t slow down for a human. We&#39;ll head to the Yard at Servants&#39; full speed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right.... Senpai, excuse me for a bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t drop me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Pleasure&#39;s mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;ll do everything I can not to drop you. Don&#39;t let go of my hand.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, hurry up—Tch. There&#39;s the enemy already!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Multiple enemy responses, coming from all directions. Break through before they surround us!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s most of them! Forget the rest and just run, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He fights pretty fiercely. I guess he really is the Treacherous Knight of legend.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, you&#39;re right. His combat powers match what&#39;s in the legend.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s swift and accurate, like a bolt of lighting flashing through the sky. You won&#39;t sense a shred of doubt in his blade.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Treacherous Knight?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean Mordred?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, come to think— I never gave Fujimaru a proper explanation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mordred the Treacherous Knight has manifested here as a Saber class.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of course, he&#39;s not from this era. He&#39;s from the Arthurian legends of the 5th and 6th century.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The one who brought upon its end. He literally betrayed King Arthur.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was no ordinary betrayal, either. He brought together all of Arthur&#39;s enemies, both domestic and foreign...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and became what we call the Treacherous King. In peaceful times, he could&#39;ve been king himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are many stories of his own glory. He was originally a Knight of the Round Table—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And is said to be King Arthur&#39;s &quot;son. &quot;But there&#39;s also stories that the King didn&#39;t admit such.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Some say that&#39;s the reason for his betrayal. At the end, why did Mordred betray King Arthur?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Only he—no, she herself knows.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did the rebellion succeed?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did the rebellion fail?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. Mordred died during the battle on the Hill of Camlann.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They killed each other. She fought King Arthur with the sword Clarent...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and King Arthur fought with a holy spear and pierced her through.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> King Arthur was fatally wounded as well and—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What are you guys babbling about? Hurry up and let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, r-right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s hurry!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Roger, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> They&#39;re attacking us while we run! They just keep coming!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t stop, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry to interrupt while you&#39;re moving. I&#39;ve got news from Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ll give you her analysis on Helter Skelter,that huge armored robot.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She&#39;s still not finished,but according to what she&#39;s found so far...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> First, it&#39;s not a Golem. The video showed no traces of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even if it&#39;s a pure machine...there&#39;s still many unknowns,except that it seems to be steam-operated.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It looks like technology that doesn&#39;t exist in our year of 2017.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It was made via some technology that was hidden, or perhaps lost—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s as if it&#39;s a product of some super-technology from a world that took a &quot;different path&quot; than our own.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Yeah.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...So, I guess you&#39;re running right now. It would make sense that you wouldn&#39;t answer.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got. Good luck, guys!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jack the Ripper:</strong> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Jack the Ripper:</strong> You came out here. All right. Hehe...what should we do?</p><p><strong>Jack the Ripper:</strong> Should we kill you? One, two, three, lots. Lots.</p><p><strong>Jack the Ripper:</strong> Hehe. We killed lots and lots,but we&#39;re still hungry. We&#39;re starving.</p><p><strong>Jack the Ripper:</strong> The police officers don&#39;t have much magical energy, you know.</p><p><strong>Jack the Ripper:</strong> So thanks for coming. We&#39;ll be full after we eat your magical energy.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We made it—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> No, I don&#39;t think we did. This smells of blood...the Yard&#39;s been wiped out, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There are two moving responses there besides you. Jack the Ripper, and one more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can assume it&#39;s an unknown Servant. You there—</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong> Yes. I&#39;m a Caster Servant. I&#39;m one of the leaders of the &quot;Project&quot; you know of.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Project Demonic Fog?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why are you doing this?</p><hr><p><strong>H：???:</strong> It&#39;s a complex set of circumstances, you see. Oh, please call me &quot;P. &quot;</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Unfortunately, you&#39;re too late. Scotland Yard has been slaughtered to the last man.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> They all died horribly. That girl has no compassion within her at all.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> But it was necessary. A necessary sacrifice. That&#39;s all I can say.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Man is to be loved. Love and emotions are both noble, brilliant things.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> But— How sad. Sometimes they pale in comparison to the greater good.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Something we need was kept inside Scotland Yard.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Figures the British Empire, home of the Mage&#39;s Association and the Clock Tower, would put a heavy magical seal on.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> And so, sadly,they were in the way of our greater good.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Why do you mouth off like you actually know stuff? I could care less about love and emotions!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yet again, you guys laid your hands on what&#39;s mine. You&#39;re no king. How dare you touch what belongs to a king!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A Heroic Spirit, killing innocent people?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Have you no pride as a hero?</p><hr><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Yes, and so you see. I am so filled with sorrow I cannot control myself.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Humans, possessing emotion, should be sacred. Humans, filled with love, should be dazzling.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> My power cannot save them. No, looking at the results, it could never save them.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Time is being incinerated. Humanity is being incinerated.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> The march of civilization, emotions, love, are all disappearing. Only four more singularities remain in the world.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> How sad. But neither you nor I can stop it.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> No, if we could not stop it—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I feel a contradiction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A contradiction in your words when you speak of emotion. Caster, no, &quot;P,&quot; who are you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You used Jack to take human lives. You&#39;re surely the one without compassion.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Yes, perhaps I am,beautiful young girl.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> I am a mage, and a wicked and cruel one at that. Even now, I tell an innocent girl as follows:</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Jack. You handle them.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Do what you like. They might be &quot;your mother. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Huh? They...might?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Oh, We see. Hmmm. Then we&#39;ll do to you what we do to Mommy, okay?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Will you let us &quot;go back? &quot;Will you let us go inside you...inside Mommy...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> No. You&#39;re going straight back to the Throne. I&#39;ll kill you here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think we should stop Assassin here.... Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s stop her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Prepare for combat.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Right, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Mo-mmy...No...No, no, noo...It hurts...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Why...Why?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ...Why? Tell me...Please...Please?</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Farewell, child who knows not love. I pray that someday you find the love you seek.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> —Now then. I suppose I should die by your hands here as well.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> The wicked mage is defeated by the heroes. That is one of the endings I seek.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> But,I will first fulfill my duty.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Farewell, you heroes who would walk the bright path. You too, Knight of the Round Table—</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> I pray that you forever remain the &quot;heroes&quot; who defeat evil.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wait! Aah, damn it! He disappeared! That&#39;s why I hate mages!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Teleportation—If it wasn&#39;t caused by the use of a Command Spell, it&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a skill closer to True Magic. With the way he did it...A possibility is the Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s possible. He did say that he was one of the people behind Project Demonic Fog trying to destroy this era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s also possible that the owner of the Holy Grail teleported him away as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What are they...What are they trying to do here in London?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Who cares? We&#39;ll find them and crush them.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> ...I have returned.</p><p><strong>&quot;B&quot;:</strong> Sshhuu...Kkoohh...</p><p><strong>&quot;M&quot;:</strong> Excellent work.... So that girl was defeated?</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> Unfortunately, she&#39;s dead. A second loss, after Mephistopheles.</p><p><strong>&quot;M&quot;:</strong> The grand scheme remains unaffected.

A shame about the officers at the Yard.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Rest for a little. I heard you haven&#39;t rested at all since your arrival, right?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Pushing yourself doesn&#39;t equate to good work. Be it writing or hunting for the Holy Grail, occasional breaks are needed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you. But...there&#39;s no time.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Fool. Are you a workaholic, too? Can you not forget the weight of what you carry?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Then let me tell you a story to pass the time. A story of how Nursery Rhyme and I materialized.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...you mean Alice, right? That&#39;s what she called herself...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> No, Nursery Rhyme. You left for the Yard before I could tell you.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I didn&#39;t get to say this, but both Nursery Rhyme and I appeared &quot;from the demonic fog. &quot;</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> With no Master,and no summoning ritual, either.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah, so was I, come to think of it. Jekyll&#39;s no Master, and there was no summoning ritual.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I just woke up one moment in the fog. Huh, do Servants just naturally appear like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe they do.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, no, no! That&#39;s impossible!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If you can just appear...No, be summoned on your own,you&#39;re something way more powerful than a Servant!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know about that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s normally impossible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you mean—naturally appearing Heroic Spirits,there aren&#39;t many, but there are a few such records.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But when that happens,they don&#39;t have a personality of their own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When a Heroic Spirit appears as a Servant,they&#39;re always summoned from the Throne by a ritual.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Listen, in the other three eras we went to, the Servants were always summoned under the Grail&#39;s influence.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s absolutely impossible for a Servant to just appear on its own!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> So the Servants aren&#39;t appearing from the fog, then? That leaves one possibility.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> The fog was &quot;created by the Holy Grail. &quot;Or, what creates the fog is influenced by the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...what it would mean. That&#39;s the logical conclusion. No contradictions.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Logic applies to most things in the real world. About the only thing it doesn&#39;t apply to is love.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Use your imagination. Then, you&#39;ll anticipate most things, and sometimes even predict them.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Haha. Love? Like you&#39;d know, you punk.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I don&#39;t want to hear that from a kid who doesn&#39;t even know love. I&#39;m a virgin. I know all about love and romance.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Huh? Hmm. Huh? That doesn&#39;t make sense, does it? Hmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know, but those are amazing words.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hmm? It&#39;s true, it doesn&#39;t...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Have you forgotten? I am Andersen. My storytelling makes me a Caster Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> If a swordsman&#39;s skills lie in battle, an author&#39;s skills lie in letters, words, indolence, pain, and love.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Be it improv poetry or a crazy deadline,a true author is capable of anything when serious.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I am a creative author. Not many can match me for imagination.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I won&#39;t lose a debate to an amateur. If you&#39;re not going to rest, go for a late-night patrol.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah. You&#39;re right! If we can nab that &quot;P&quot;and make him talk, we can end this.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;m going for a patrol then. I&#39;ll take a walk to the edge of the city area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, Senpai...Mordred is about to leave.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s follow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s better to act than do nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> You&#39;re good at manipulating people, huh? But thanks, they were under a lot of strain.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s nothing compared to writing a moving story.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I just had to &quot;motivate&quot; them.... But I don&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What I showed them may be an illusion. A wisp within a match light. Logical or not, it&#39;s no different from a fantasy.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> You just used your imagination, right? So—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Don&#39;t be stupid. That was just a &quot;play&quot; on words.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...It feels strange to do a patrol with a bunch of people.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I always did it on my own. Well, this makes it easier,so I don&#39;t mind...Oh, there&#39;s some already.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I just can&#39;t match Mordred for speed. I see them too. Enemy responses!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger. Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There were quite a few. Whew.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You must be tired. Do you need to rest?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> No, there were just so many of them. It would be different if there had been a Helter Skelter.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s quite strong. It&#39;s probably the only enemy I&#39;ve enjoyed fighting during this materialization.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash and Fujimaru have only encountered it once. It was a tough opponent.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Maybe there aren&#39;t that many of them? Come to think,you covered a lot of ground but haven&#39;t seen any.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah...Come to think, I&#39;ve never seen big groups of them.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If possible, I&#39;d like to go up against a tough enemy. I hope we&#39;ll see one tonight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now that you&#39;ve said it, we will.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re jinxing us.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, you think so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Why don&#39;t we go on a bit further? There is still some distance to the City&#39;s edge.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, well, I&#39;m confirming map information...It&#39;s not like I&#39;m particularly familiar with London.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well, if something turns up, we&#39;ll deal with it then.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Hmph, more gutless enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All enemies destroyed. No, I don&#39;t think they were as easy to defeat as you say...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If the fog makes Servants appear,I want it to toss out a strong one.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh...But you know. What if what comes out isn&#39;t necessarily an enemy?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right. In fact, you&#39;ve been helping us. Same goes for Andersen.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But, Nursery Rhyme and Jack were enemies. Both were likely Servants that materialized from the Demonic Fog, too.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;d like to occasionally see an enemy that faces me head-on, instead of all these guys that attack from behind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Right? You&#39;re quite a perceptive Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sneak attacks are good too.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...You really think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, let&#39;s continue patrolling. It&#39;s only a little bit further to the edge of the City.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Come at me! Strong enemies!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well then—who is it that doth summon me!? I, Caster Shakespeare, travelled with great haste to the city of fog.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Or so I wish to say to you. But it seems that I was not summoned to participate in a Holy Grail War this time.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> This is quite vexing indeed. O God! Where dost lie the grand story that I am destined to behold?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> No reply. Silence. God hast forsaken me. Where art the tale making blood boil, flesh dance, heart shiver, and soul shake!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Then, I can only utter these words. Oh, &quot;Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind! &quot;</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...This is a blank. Next.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ah, what have we here? How curious our paths should finally cross within this unfathomable fog!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you know him? This, uh...Caster Shakespeare guy?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Never heard of him. He&#39;s a blank.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But we just confirmed our theory. Right now, this guy materialized from the Demonic Fog.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It is a tragedy that my Master does not exist. But, I was able to meet you. Surely this too is destiny.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I shall weave a tale of your exploits. I pray that your tale shall live up to your reputation.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> This guy—doesn&#39;t look like an enemy. It&#39;s kind of odd if you think about it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What&#39;s the difference between him and the likes of Jack or that clown? Jack aside, everyone moved on their own will.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Also—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Never mind. Wait. What, did this night patrol hit the jackpot?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> He&#39;s here. The one we&#39;ve been waiting for. Hey you! You got some nerve for someone who fled!</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> ...Looks like I am late.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s &quot;P! &quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Just when did he...</p><hr><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> How unfortunate. It seems you have already procured the Servant that newly materialized.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> He appears to be a Caster. If only we had procured him, he would have made a fine ally.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hah hah. I get it. It&#39;s really quite simple when you reveal the trick.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. Now I understand as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So, you procure and round up Servants materializing from the Demonic Fog, and make them your allies.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see. Logically it&#39;s simple. But, easier said than done.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Unless you have the Holy Grail, it&#39;s impossible to make Heroic Spirits move according to your will.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> —Correct. I confess as much. It is as you say.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> We continue to wait in London for those who are indispensable to us to manifest themselves.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> So, we procure Heroic Spirits materializing from the fog one by one, and &quot;adjust&quot; them so they work on expanding the fog.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> It is truly regrettable indeed that we were not able to procure all of you.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> We surely would have been fine friends. All of us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I doubt it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re kidding me.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, Senpai. I feel exactly the same as you do.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hah! Seriously. You&#39;ll have to allow me to pass on that!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You won&#39;t get away this time! Mage, name yourself before I cut you down!</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> —As you wish. There is no catalyst to transport at this time. I shall procure you here myself.</p><p><strong>&quot;P&quot;:</strong> I am Paracelsus von Hohenheim. I manipulate the Four Great Elementals, and I seek the True Ether.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Of course...I possess a different objective at the moment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, prepare for a battle between Servants! Your orders—!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...A most natural result.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> This is precisely what I&#39;d expect from a sword-wielding hero. Naturally, evildoers must fall.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Overcoming all the world&#39;s evils. Resisting all this world&#39;s greed.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> And you who will carve out the future of this world. May the path before you...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...be somehow illuminated...By true...light...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I have confirmed termination of the enemy Servant. Victory is ours, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Damn. The idiot disappeared without a trace. He was a nauseating mage from beginning to end.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> &quot;Carve out the future? &quot; Give me a break. As if I&#39;m the type to do that. Ugh.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> &quot;Life&#39;s but a walking shadow, a poor player. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh? What was that?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It&#39;s nothing but a few fanciful phrases crossing my mind. It is quite a fine spectacle that you have shown me today.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I was only able to behold the mage in a short role,but he provided a truly satisfying final act.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...What an idiot.

Go talk in the study until they&#39;re satisfied.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Bummer...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Good luck. Maybe you can count that as part of resting up?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ha! Do you think you can take a nap in front a pond of geese? Look at Fujimaru&#39;s face. I&#39;ve never seen anyone so dumbfounded.</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s right. I forgot to tell you what it is that we&#39;re doing.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> That playwright is focused on getting these events down on paper, but not me. I want to do as little work as possible.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> But there is something on my mind. I heard from Fujimaru of the developments leading up to now...The seven Singularities.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...More precisely, something about the magecraft ritual called the Holy Grail War bothers me...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...I don&#39;t have enough materials to make a judgment. To be honest, I&#39;m almost at a stalemate.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Hmph. I see you can act like a Caster. Although you&#39;re still useless...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah, excuse me. Can we get back on topic? A review of the current situation, and future plans?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Luckily, enemy&#39;s awareness is focusing on the Demonic Fog. If they want to wipe us out, they&#39;d go around destroying buildings.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The fact that they haven&#39;t means the enemy is only aware of the streets that the Demonic Fog extends to.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something there to take advantage of—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...Is there?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I hope so. Hmm...Is there? I hope there is...It&#39;d be nice...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> This is a pain, do something. We can&#39;t spend as much time outside like we used to.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wandering around aimlessly just eats away at my magical energy with each battle.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If we could at least disable the Helter Skelters,it wouldn&#39;t be that much of an effort, but...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> There&#39;s no way. This is a problem, as we might end up in a stalemate.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Urhh......Uhh, urhh...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> All right, then how about this?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> There is an outbreak of Helter Skelters, but how about gathering some data to support my theory?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Run an errand for me, basically. You guys have stamina, so isn&#39;t this the perfect job?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Working outside among all those Helter Skelters is a tall order...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s try it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s cooperate with Andersen and Shakespeare.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai. It won&#39;t make our current situation any better but—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t think things will get any better if we just stay holed up in this apartment.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, if there is anything we can do,getting on it would be constructive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Still, you want us to gather data,but where are we supposed to go?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu, fouuu...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Oh, come on, this is London. Your destination is obvious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Obvious?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, what is it?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Maybe the Mage&#39;s Association—AKA &quot;Clock Tower? &quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Does he mean the Mage&#39;s Association?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Correct. Once man enters AD, mages centered around a giant academy—the Mage&#39;s Association, Clock Tower.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Right. A giant academy that is unlocking the secrets of the world exists here in London. Why would you not use it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re right...B-But in the state London is in now, I wonder...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If the Mage&#39;s Association—Clock Tower still stands,I&#39;d naturally assume Jekyll is in contact with them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good point. Jekyll hasn&#39;t spoken about the Clock Tower.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...That&#39;s because there was no need.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The Mage&#39;s Association...That&#39;s like underground, from Regent Park all the way to Westminster, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> After materializing and meeting Jekyll,I went there to check it out immediately.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The British Museum, was it? I went there because I heard that&#39;s where the entrance was.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But the entrance was completely sealed off. It was a ruined pile of rubble.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Yeah. Strangely enough, &quot;the building was demolished. &quot;No part was left untouched.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Thinking back, perhaps the mastermind of &quot;Project Demonic Fog&quot; crushed all possibility of resistance.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I don&#39;t mind if it got destroyed. So what if it&#39;s a pile of rubbles.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Nothing could be better if the mages are alive, but that has nothing to do with my objective one way or another.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What I need are records. Data.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s certain that the important archives are protected by considerably firm seals. Take me there.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyuuu...Fou...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Then I shall accompany you. The ruins of a mystic academy should serve as a font of inspiration!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It seems this is going to be a large group. But...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I suppose the more firepower the better, in case you encounter Helter Skelters. Yeah, that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh......Urhh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You should stay here, Fran.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s dangerous, so hold the fort, Fran.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree. Right now, London is especially dangerous. Please stay here, Fran.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, urrh...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Then let&#39;s be off. We&#39;ll visit that formerly flourishing mystic academy.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Oh, and also Saber...Do make sure to protect us weak Casters.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh? Protect you? Say that to Shieldy over there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, u-um—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> All right, I&#39;m going, too! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wha...</p><h2 id="section-8-the-death-of-the-mage-s-association" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-the-death-of-the-mage-s-association" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 8: The Death of the Mage&#39;s Association</h2><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...You know. You said &quot;a large group,&quot;but we can&#39;t count you in during combat.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> You&#39;re looking for the ruins of the Mage&#39;s Association,yes? Surely my intellectual curiosity as a scholar will be aroused.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Besides, I can be good when need to. You see, I also have an &quot;ace up my sleeve. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> And I have faith that you&#39;ll all protect me. I&#39;m counting on you, Saber.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Tch. As I said, I&#39;m not protecting anyone. But do as you like.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All right then. We really should get moving. The British Museum means we&#39;re heading to the Regent Park area.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s some distance from here. You&#39;d best prepare yourselves for a succession of battles.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mmm? Come to think of it—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Didn&#39;t the Mage&#39;s Association exist as several college towns in the London suburbs and stuff?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> That&#39;s that. This is this.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> The Mage&#39;s Association originated at their London HQ,and added facilities centuries later as they grew in scale.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> That&#39;s why interspersed college towns center around London, as it&#39;s the heart of Mage&#39;s Association and Clock Tower.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Multiple cities built to surround London comprise the rest of the Association.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Doctor, have you never been to the Clock Tower before?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Oh. I knew there was something unpolished about you. Are you a country bumpkin?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Gulp. N-No, of course not.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s just that I haven&#39;t had much connection to London,I mean, being so far away...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> B-But I knew what was going on in London! Director Marie was sent from the Mage&#39;s Association, too!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Enough chatter. We need to—Ah, as soon as I think it. Here we go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Multiple machine sounds ahead. Senpai, I think the Helter Skelters are here!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They didn&#39;t waste any time. Fight your way through them and get to Regent Park on the double!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Roger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go right through them!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> The British Museum! A symbol of the British Empire! Or rather, what remains—</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh, what a sorrowful sight! This museum once held so many of humanity&#39;s greatest treasures!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I cannot help but sigh. This building once held human progress itself.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Can such a thing be allowed! Oh! &#39;Tis like the burning of the Library of Alexandria!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Truly, a shame—</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> However, however. This is the way of humanity as well.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Foolishness and grieving are human traits. &quot;You, gods, will give us some faults to make us men. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...It&#39;s no different than the last time I was here. Rubble. Ruin. Nothing else.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Whoever destroyed this place must&#39;ve had a personal grudge. There&#39;s no survivors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So this is the British Museum...or what&#39;s left. I&#39;d seen it, but just in image data...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nowhere else in London were buildings destroyed. Just here...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s sad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t like destroyed buildings.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai...Yes...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> All right, physical laborers. Oh, especially Saber and Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Start digging here. According to Jekyll,the Clock Tower spread underground as well.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Despite the thorough wreckage, the ground is intact. That means what we&#39;re after is underground.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> But, unfortunately, the stairs are buried in rubble. So—You see?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Time to show off the ridiculous strength of Servants! Now go smash stuff like a bulldozer!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> That&#39;s true! Sadly, I expend tremendous magical energy if I hold anything heavier than a pen!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I-I&#39;ll help. Yeah. I probably won&#39;t be of much use though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yay! I&#39;m faster this time! Magical energy responses near you! And lots of them!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hmm...It&#39;s true. There&#39;s something here. What is this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You don&#39;t see anything, right? But it&#39;s there. And it&#39;s moving around.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s not the Mystic Codes scattered in the rubble, either. Which means there&#39;s only one answer!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> It&#39;s from below!? Saber, sorry, but get ready—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t treat me like you&#39;re my Master! I know! If they come out, we&#39;ll fight them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, multiple incoming enemies! Magical energy signatures are growing—Assume they&#39;re attacking!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Be careful!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Master. Beginning combat!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I shall aid you as well. A shield maiden dancing amidst the rubble—truly stimulates the imagination!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Battle is over, Senpai. Good work.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I don&#39;t see Helter Skelters around,but we still ran into something troublesome...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Those were...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I remember that shape.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. The enemy has a striking resemblance to the magical tome we saw in Soho.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But this time our attacks worked...Without Andersen giving them a name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Normal attacks alone were sufficient. They also didn&#39;t change form...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Last time I was here, I didn&#39;t see any floating books like that.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> May I speak? This is just a guess,but I think those are a type of transformed grimoire.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Maybe the Demonic Fog transformed the tomes that were kept underground with the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Oh...I was thinking the same thing, but he said it first...)</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...A swarm of attacking books, huh?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...It was like a nightmare, or perhaps a vision of hell.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Don&#39;t be stupid. Those things weren&#39;t even...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Haha. What&#39;s wrong, authors? You&#39;re not running your mouths like usual?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...I&#39;m holding back. No, forget it. Forget it! Wow, that felt good! That felt great!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> To burn a book! It is something inconceivable! Oh, how sad...but there was a joy in it!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Wrongdoings that should ne&#39;er be done. Unforgivable acts of barbarism! There should only be sadness, yet...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I cannot help but feel a moment of forbidden joy! Oh, my God!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> No books are needed except my own. Actually, I&#39;d prefer to even burn my own works!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> If there were no books in the world! No need to lament of the many great works I&#39;ll never read!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> If there were no books in the world! I&#39;d never have to scream, &quot;Who published this trash!? &quot;</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> If there were no books in the world! I&#39;d never have to worry about deadlines!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> What an honest man! Oh, but his words strike me in my heart!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo, fooou...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> W-What&#39;s gotten into them?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> This is kind of amazing...Really...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Authors are twisted.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Authors are creatures of paradox?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-Anyway, Senpai. This makes our path clear, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When the book-type enemies appeared,they formed a path to the underground by chance—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah. Once the author Heroic Spirits calm down,it&#39;s time to go underground!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m so excited. This is like the headquarters of the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I wonder what it&#39;s like down there? Oh, I wish I could go and see for myself.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Then you should come. Instead of just being a voice.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I-I...um...I have to observe, and keep Chaldea running...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> O-Okay! Back to my observation work!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Kyukyu...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...It&#39;s like an endless dungeon, huh?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s dark.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Indeed, and the air is awfully wet.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s what mage dwellings are like, right? Everybody knows they like it dark and damp.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do they?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyuu, kyaau! Fou!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The rodent is agreeing with me. It says this sure feels like where a mage lives. Right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou? You seem kind of excited...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does he feel something?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyukyu...Kyaau...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He really is agreeing with Mordred.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyuu, kyaau! Kyuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. I wonder if Fou has taken a liking to Mordred.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The endless dark corridors might be because, well, we&#39;re choosing to walk down corridors not blocked by debris.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All the entrances to the rooms are smashed,or filled with rubble...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It feels like someone destroyed this place thoroughly. There&#39;s not a single surviving mage.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If that theory&#39;s correct, the enemy should have sent someone down here. And they—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> They might still be here, huh? Looks like you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Magical energy response detected! Senpai, something&#39;s around the corner!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Time for combat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This is a closed area, so be careful!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Roger, Master!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Hmmph. I&#39;ll help you this time. Don&#39;t expect it all the time, though.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Mr. Andersen. This door is—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I&#39;m sensing magical energy. Yeah, this is it. A warded entrance to a library.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s not blocked with rubble either. Excellent. I hope what I&#39;m after is here, but that&#39;s up to chance.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Saber, Mash Kyrielight,and Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Jekyll and I are going inside. Guard the door.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Roger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Leave it to us!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Find what you&#39;re after quickly and get back here. I&#39;m not sure when the enemy might show—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...And there they are now! Flying books, and even a Helter Skelter!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Multiple moving responses! Th-This is not good!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re rushing in one after another. Can&#39;t assess the total amount! Andersen, escape once you find the reference you&#39;re after!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Oh...I don&#39;t know about that. This is a problem.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> This is...This is indeed a problem...I see. So that&#39;s how they guard the books.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What? Stop being pompous and tell us what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> The library books are warded by special, powerful spells. They can&#39;t leave this room! We can&#39;t go through the door!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Luckily, I have several good guesses for the references I seek. But, oh...These are...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...&quot;Wait a while for me to finish reading them. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> WHAT!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> One scans information deep in the mystic garden! The other guards the door against a horde of foes!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> On one side, a battle of knowledge! On another, a battle of strength!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> This is truly a situation that entrances one&#39;s heart!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh, which side should I stand on? Which should I see, that I can record in a book!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Just shut up and fight over here! They&#39;re coming!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...This is a defensive battle! Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s most of &#39;em—No, wait. There&#39;s more?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s more! The layout down here puts you at a huge disadvantage!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The enemy&#39;s just going to keep coming! And you have to defend a single point!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re okay for now, but if this drags out it&#39;ll be bad. Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We can&#39;t leave yet!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Just hang in a little more!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Roger, Master! Continuing battle!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Just a little more, Fujimaru! I&#39;m at the best part. It&#39;s all for nothing if we leave now.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Badly outnumbered! The ideal situation for a hero,but this is—</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> This is perhaps a bit too many. I&#39;m about to run out of magical energy. Actually, I already have.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wha—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...Oh, fine. I wanted to avoid this if I could, but...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Huh? Jekyll, why are you coming out into the hall?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There&#39;s nothing a would-be mage can do here! Get back in the library!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I told you. I have an ace-in-the-hole.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jekyll, that&#39;s—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> An elixir. A &quot;special&quot; one I made. First you do this...and then inject it...like this...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wh-What!? A strange magical energy response suddenly spawned there!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo–u! Kyau!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Haha—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Hehehe, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve been outside! HERE I AM!!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!!?!?!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Jekyll?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, that was Mr. Jekyll...Mr. Henry Jekyll! But the way he changed is &quot;just like in the book&quot;...</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> I&#39;m &quot;Hyde! &quot; If I don&#39;t like you, I kill you! You get in my way, I kill you! Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> HYAHAHAHAHAHAH! I&#39;LL KILL YOU, HELTER SKELTER–!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...He ran right at the enemy. He&#39;s just like a Berserker. Not bad!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Elixir-induced transformation. I see, truly Jekyll and Hyde! But physical transformation must put an awful strain on him!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll last long...Andersen, you better hurry up!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I understand. Don&#39;t hurry me.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Reading should be done at one&#39;s own pace. Yes, alone, and in a quiet room—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Hmm. It&#39;s not quiet. The noise outside is bothering me.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You don&#39;t understand at all! Just hurry up!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Damn it. Shieldy, we&#39;ll follow Jekyll!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. —Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Work together and don&#39;t go too deep!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t let Hyde get away!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger, Master! Continuing combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy units destroyed!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...We&#39;re done, huh? Whew, I don&#39;t think...I can do anymore...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re back to normal.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> There was a chance I wouldn&#39;t come back, so I&#39;m glad I did. Is Andersen&#39;s book-reading—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I&#39;m done. I finished decoding most of the documents I was after.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Besides, there were also several interesting books. I satisfied my personal curiosity, too. Great work, guys.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Personal curiosity?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fou......Fo...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What a free spirit Andersen is...There&#39;s something impressive in his lack of shame. However...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Y-You need to get out of here! There are more enemies coming!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Break away, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good work. Let&#39;s get out of here.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai. Let&#39;s return to the surface right away.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Once again, good work. Let&#39;s return to the apartment and I&#39;ll share the results.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> —Okay! I&#39;ve recovered! Now it&#39;s time for me to rejoin the heroes&#39; battle as well!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh? Are you all ready to return home?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s right! We&#39;re leaving, damn it!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> And so you see—Your efforts have answered a certain question.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Again, you have my thanks. Thank you, Fujimaru, Mash, Saber.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Y-Yeah.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> My wallet is so empty I can&#39;t reward you a single penny,but I hope these observations are worth it.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m looking forward to them, Mr. Andersen. Enough to forget all this muscle pain.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> In light of Mr. Jekyll&#39;s urgent need for rest,I&#39;ll get right to the point.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What bothered me in the first place was the relationship between &quot;Heroic Spirits&quot; and &quot;Servants. &quot;</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Heroic Spirits are records or results of human history.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Be they real or fictional,they&#39;ll exist as long as humanity does.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> But a Servant is something different. This treats a Heroic Spirit as an &quot;existence&quot; in reality...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> A familiar given a container called a Class and &quot;made real,&quot; when its existence is uncertain to begin with.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> But I ask you, Jekyll and Roman, was it? Is such a thing possible with the powers of a human, a mage?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Turning a Heroic Spirit into a familiar—I see,that&#39;s powerful. The strongest summoning spell imaginable.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> But a human couldn&#39;t handle such a spell on their own. If it&#39;s possible, it would be—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A being greater than humans. An &quot;Authority&quot; exercised by a supernatural being, labeled as world or god. Is that it?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Indeed. Heroic Spirits can&#39;t be summoned with human power alone. There needs to be some other reason—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It needs an extra push from something else, I think.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um. Isn&#39;t that the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a fact that up to this point, many Servants have been summoned thanks to the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Indeed. You spoke of the seven Singularities. Seven Holy Grails driving the different eras mad.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> That&#39;s why I asked Dr. Roman about the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What exactly is the Holy Grail War that enables Heroic Spirit Summons? For what reason was it created?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yup. I don&#39;t have detailed data, but the origin is a town in rural Japan. The flaming city you visited, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> There, they made a vessel for the Holy Grail, used its power to summon Heroic Spirits, who they had compete as Servants.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> That&#39;s what seemed weird to me. There&#39;s a flaw in the concept of making Heroic Spirits fight each other.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It felt like there was something else going on. So I decided to read the Mage&#39;s Association archives.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> And I found what I expected.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> The original Heroic Spirit summoning ritual was a ceremony to pit seven powers against one.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It wasn&#39;t something where seven Heroic Spirits fought one another.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> &quot;Ritual: Heroic Spirit Summon&quot; and &quot;Ritual: Holy Grail War&quot; are the same systems with different genres, you could say.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> &quot;Holy Grail War&quot; altered an existing spell and used it for selfish human purposes.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Meanwhile, it&#39;s base spell &quot;Heroic Spirit Summon&quot;...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...was a ritual to put &quot;humanity&#39;s strongest seven Heroic Spirits&quot; against &quot;a single powerful enemy. &quot;</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> That&#39;s what got distorted in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Then you and the others are also?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Yeah. Since there are only supposed to be seven of them, all the Heroic Spirits that got summoned later—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Well, they&#39;re cheap, convenient,multi-purpose familiars.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...So um...What?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...For now, just know that the Ritual: Holy Grail War was based off of something else.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, I see! I see! An interesting theory.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Chaldea wasn&#39;t able to make its own summoning system from the ground up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We modified and stabilized the Fuyuki ritual,but never considered the possibility of an older original.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Doctor. This is a viewpoint we&#39;ve never heard before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It casts doubt about the fundamental nature of the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I thought I knew what Heroic Spirits were originally. But it was nothing more than information—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It wasn&#39;t nearly at the level of what you just pointed out. That&#39;s very impressive, Mr. Andersen.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess this is the keen eye of observation owned by an author that left his name in history.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What you&#39;d call an objective perspective?</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that special. Anyway...That&#39;s fine, but you know...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> This doesn&#39;t help us do anything about the mass-production of those Helter Skelters.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th...That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Well, that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Of course it is. I just felt a hitch with the Heroic Spirit summoning system.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> If we&#39;re all normal Classes summoned by a single system—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I wondered what kind of Spirit Origins the original seven for this system must have had.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...And someone else thought the same thing.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coincidence that information about this,even the parts you&#39;d expect to be lost, was all in one place.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> &quot;Someone&quot; predicted our coming,and put it there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Someone?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Who could it be? A surviving mage of the Clock Tower? Or a Servant?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I don&#39;t think it would be a mage, but I don&#39;t know why a Servant would do it. We&#39;ll have to set that aside for now.</p><h2 id="section-9-opportunity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-opportunity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: Opportunity</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Hm...It seems I&#39;m picking up interference on my mic,but speak of the devil? I detect multiple hostiles around you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There are more roaming around the apartment than earlier...Enough magical energy distortion to disturb communications.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This mechanical sound—I believe it&#39;s a group of Helter Skelters.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I doubt they&#39;ll break in, but they are a nuisance. Get out there and dismantle them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ll finish them off quickly.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai. Intercepting them in the alley. Let&#39;s reduce their numbers.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Good work. We drove off the Helter Skelters.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mmm. Mmm? Wait...Hold on a second, um...So that means...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> —Helter Skelters?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes. That&#39;s it! Actually, I&#39;ve made progress on the Helter Skelter analysis!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As expected, they&#39;re machines created by technology unknown to us. I suspect they were built–with magical energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mean...machines created with a combination of magecraft and science?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Not exactly. They are made by magical energy, but they are machines.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I still don&#39;t understand the kind of techniques used but structurally, they&#39;re machines. Yet, they were formed by magecraft.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> In other words...Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I don&#39;t really understand...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe like Noble Phantasms?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Exactly! Good insight!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...In other words, they&#39;re armaments made of magical energy, just like Servants&#39; Noble Phantasms, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah. They&#39;re half-baked mechanical constructions,which is why I was looking too hard for magecraft-made golem approximations.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Basically, they&#39;re Noble Phantasms. Powerful figures woven from magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Unlike a sword Noble Phantasm that is a &quot;razor edge,&quot;Helter Skelters are &quot;fighting machine&quot; Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It looks like they operate autonomously, but they&#39;re actually controlled by someone like the Noble Phantasm&#39;s owner.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re a remote-controlled robotic squad, so to say. All units should stop if we break the acting controller.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then, considerable exceptions aside, if we beat the Servant possessing the Noble Phantasm—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The robots will disappear. Well, we can see the whole picture now, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So Doctor,where is the Servant who owns the Noble Phantasm?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...Yes. Right, you wouldn&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Not even Da Vinci knows, or rather, she said she can&#39;t clean up my mess anymore...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Mmm?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What, someone else did the analysis?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Uuh, that&#39;s right...After all, I wasn&#39;t getting anywhere on my own...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m a medical staff...Considering that, don&#39;t you think I&#39;m doing pretty well?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes. You&#39;re making a great effort, Doctor. Right, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Thank you, thank you...Fujimaru...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where the Servant with the Noble Phantasm is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Uuh...I feel so lonely...</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh......Uh, uh, uhrrr...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We know what we have to do. Yes. But, we don&#39;t know our destination. Do we?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Urh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What should we do? If we could trace the magical energy in one shot...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If the example of a remote control is correct,then maybe we can trace the magical energy back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Da Vinci, wise in the ways of science and magecraft,brought up that example, so I imagine it&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But with the effect of the Demonic Fog, doing something subtle like tracing marks of magical energy...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Is not something I can do. It&#39;s rather difficult even with Chaldea&#39;s equipment.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I give up, too. I&#39;m not a real mage in the first place.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Urh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fran&#39;s been making noise...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Somebody here has something to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fran? You&#39;re hiding over there...Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh......Uhh, urrrh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, she fled from the literary Heroic Spirits next door? I know how she feels. They are annoying.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh......Uhh, urrrh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t hide, show your face here. Come on now.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh, uhhh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What, you have something to say to us? Then spit it out.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t mind. As long as you&#39;re fine with us,right, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You can tell us anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh, urrrh...Ahh...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Ahh...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Ahh, uhh...Urhhh, uhh...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Ahh, ahh, ahhh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wha...Is that true!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m shocked. Fran, I had no idea you could do that...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Tell me, do you really understand? Do you really understand what she&#39;s saying?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Somewhat. She also uses gestures,so it&#39;s like reading a kind of sign language...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It seems she knows where the Helter Skelter&#39;s remote control is.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> R-Really?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Let me double-check. Fran, can you...detect traces of the magical energy that controls them?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh. Uhh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There, you see? She nodded. All right, this makes things easier. Let&#39;s get moving!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...You know, even though I&#39;ve gotten used to it,this poor visibility is irritating.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Say, Fujimaru. Your court mage...Dr. Maron, was it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Can&#39;t he make us a far-seeing crystal or something? That would have been a snap for Merlin...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Roman! My name is Roman! And don&#39;t compare me to Merlin!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He was the ultimate hermit wizard! I&#39;m just a modern-day doctor!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Margarine?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Marmalade?</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh!? You&#39;re a mage and you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t know!? Merlin! I&#39;m talking about Merlin!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> King Arthur&#39;s successor and mastermind of the Round Table. He was a great mage born half-human, half-incubus.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> He isn&#39;t famous anymore? Haha! That feels great! Serves him right!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Merlin was one of the world&#39;s most renowned kingmakers. He was also behind Arthur pulling the sword from the stone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Apparently, he had extraordinary magecraft skills, but was ultimately imprisoned at world&#39;s end for woman trouble.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah. I heard he&#39;s all crabby and in a tower at a corner of Avalon, unable to leave or die.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> How can I put it? He was a flighty bastard. Imagine a perpetual flurry of flowers behind him...do you get me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well, whatever. Enough about him. He&#39;s so spineless he can&#39;t even rush over to London&#39;s calamity.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...More importantly. Tell me, Fujimaru, are you okay with that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay with what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (Mash, I&#39;m talking about Mash. You see how depressed she looks? Go talk to her. )</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s wrong, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You seem down, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. Physically, there&#39;s nothing wrong with me, but......mentally, I have a problem.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry, Senpai. Our battles are getting more intense,but I haven&#39;t been improving at all...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s my Noble Phantasm. Servants&#39; true fighting powers lie in Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve seen many Noble Phantasms up till now. All of them have been miracles worthy of their heroic names.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yet, I still—can&#39;t use my Noble Phantasm properly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...At this rate, I&#39;m just a burden. I know that,but I still can&#39;t remember his True Name...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even without a Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I need a Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, um...I&#39;m sorry I yelled at you. But it will definitely become necessary...that&#39;s my hunch.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s not your fault, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Indeed, the merge was due to a sudden accident. But he entrusted me with everything...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The point is, I&#39;m not oblivious of the Noble Phantasm&#39;s true value. I don&#39;t even know his True Name...</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So that&#39;s what this is about. You heard Helter Skelter is a Noble Phantasm and became depressed.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> True, a Servant who cannot use a Noble Phantasm is no Servant at all.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> No matter how weak the Noble Phantasm, its very existence is proof of that hero. It&#39;s a matter of pride.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But you&#39;re different, Mash. You&#39;re you. How you think and your honor are different from that Shield bastard.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s true you haven&#39;t mastered using that Noble Phantasm. From what I&#39;ve seen, you&#39;re about a third of the way there.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The remaining two-thirds are untapped. Or maybe you,being you, won&#39;t get to 100% and that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...So it is like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The &quot;Demi&quot; side...The human part of me is dragging Senpai down...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Fool. That&#39;s ridiculous. Listen until I&#39;m done talking.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You&#39;re not fully utilizing your Noble Phantasm. But I&#39;m sure—you&#39;re stronger than the original Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? The original Heroic Spirit...You mean the Heroic Spirit that I merged with?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yes. You&#39;re much, much stronger than him. That&#39;s coming from me, so there&#39;s no doubt about it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You may come up short not having a Noble Phantasm,but not anywhere else. Am I right, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> For you,Mash is the perfect partner, isn&#39;t she?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll do something about that Noble Phantasm!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I-Is that really the case?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Okay. If that&#39;s the case, I feel much better.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There, you see? In the first place, it&#39;s a Master&#39;s job to take care of their Servant.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Whether you can utilize the true value of a Noble Phantasm is Fujimaru&#39;s problem, not yours, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Right, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Before Mash can become a full-fledged Servant,you need to become a first-rate Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll be first-rate together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll teach you how to use it eventually.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouuu!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There you go. So don&#39;t worry about it, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Fujimaru is the one who&#39;s sitting in the hot seat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Right!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...All right, can we get moving soon? I&#39;m sorry, as everyone is in a good mood, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hmmph. Fujimaru, summon a Rider Servant and have it give Maron a swift kick with its hind legs.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, yeah, it&#39;s all my fault. My fault! Now, time for combat. Multiple hostile readings approaching!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Go rout them to liven things up!</p><h2 id="section-10-at-the-end-of-brilliant-steam" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10-at-the-end-of-brilliant-steam" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 10: At the End of Brilliant Steam</h2><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That direction. Got it.... Senpai, it seems we want to go west from here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> West is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe the Westminster area?</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yes, probably the Westminster area. That&#39;s where we&#39;ll find the Houses of Parliament.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Let&#39;s go there and pound them down. Ah. But first.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There&#39;s one thing I need to say. This time, my hands are tied protecting Fran.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You see, she&#39;s not a Servant, and it&#39;s unknown how much damage an artificial human can take.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So &quot;I&#39;m going to protect her. &quot;...We have a strange connection.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We can&#39;t count on Mordred during the battle then,so you guys will have to provide all the muscle. Be careful!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Roger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. Okay then, Senpai. Let&#39;s move out!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...To think it&#39;s really near the Houses of Parliament. What a place for a remote control. Is it actually inside?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh, uhrrr!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Looks like it&#39;s close. She says it&#39;s in our immediate vicinity—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Look, there&#39;s a gargantuan one! Fran, get behind me and stay there!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Mash, Fujimaru! I&#39;m leaving this one to you. Take it apart!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger that. Master, it&#39;s combat with a giant hostile. Awaiting orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —All giant hostile targets have gone silent.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It appears it wasn&#39;t a Servant...But, was this the Noble Phantasm that&#39;s manipulating the others?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh.... Uh, uhh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It seems so. Okay, that&#39;s one nuisance out of the way.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Good work. Fran. We pulled through thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh. Ah...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash, Fujimaru. Just in case,could you send me some visual data of the remains?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ll go ahead and analyze them here. Well, I&#39;m just going to ask Da Vinci about them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Doctor. We discovered something strange. Something that the other Helter Skelters did not possess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Perhaps the manufacturer&#39;s name? It&#39;s written in English.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> &quot;Charles Babbage, AD 1888&quot;</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh!!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hmm. What&#39;s wrong, Fran?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai. Did you sleep well?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems like you went by yourself to the nap room a little earlier...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I couldn&#39;t sleep much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Those author Heroic Spirits were there...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...um, that&#39;s right...The two Heroic Spirit authors are occupying that room...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In that case, you probably didn&#39;t get much rest. I-I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t notice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I...wish I had let you use the sofa in the living room that was assigned to me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m glad it worked out this way.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Mm. Both of you are awake. Hey, have you seen Fran around?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Come to think of it...Oh! Senpai, maybe Fran...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In the next room.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> In the authors&#39; room.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Well, if she&#39;s fine with that, it&#39;s fine. I myself have no intention of entering that room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That room gives off a kind of odd ambience. I wonder if that&#39;s the power of authors with looming deadlines.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> They&#39;ve basically just been writing since materializing. Though I&#39;m not sure if Andersen is really working or not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I couldn&#39;t help but sense a strange pressure coming from that room...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Good morning, everyone. Looks like you all got some rest.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> There&#39;s something we need to talk about, okay? It&#39;s the name you found a few hours earlier.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Charles Babbage, right? He was an outstanding British scientist and mathematician of the 19th century.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Yes. He belongs to this age. I haven&#39;t met him myself, but I recall a few things.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I&#39;m sure that he and the original Dr. Victor Frankenstein were acquaintances.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —I&#39;m sorry, but please wait.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Babbage was supposed to have passed away at least a decade prior to our present time.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Huh? No, that&#39;s strange. He may be old, but he should still be an active scholar in good health.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Jekyll, are you sure that&#39;s not a lapse in your memory? Are you really sure that Babbage is a man of this era?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Of course. I came across his name while perusing this year&#39;s Royal Society Almanac. Victor also spoke of him.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> So I can&#39;t imagine he&#39;s dead. His inventions were featured in newspapers from last year and this year, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Allow me to confirm this. Let&#39;s see, yes, a newspaper will do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Indeed, there is an article here. Charles Babbage. Born 1791. This is the very man in question.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can think of two possibilities. One is that our historical records do not match reality.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Another is that a &quot;shift&quot; of events has occurred. That, in fact, has occurred in all the previous eras.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Orleans, Rome, even Okeanos. The events were all slightly distorted and &quot;shifted. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Due to events changing, the dead are still alive and not there as Heroic Spirits—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s possible. The same applies to those who died from the Demonic Fog.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It may be that 20th century events have shifted all the way into this era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So...in the case of Fran, as well as Mr. Jekyll?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We can&#39;t rule it out. So who belongs to this era, and who doesn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s extremely difficult to determine. Especially when there are no records left in existence—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Hmm. Are you talking about me? I&#39;m curious, but we&#39;ll talk about it later. I&#39;ve received some emergency correspondence.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> It&#39;s bad news from my information network. Saber, this concerns you too.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> All the Helter Skelters that had been completely shut down—have reactivated.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What, again? So there was another remote control elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...This is indeed an emergency. We need to deactivate them again as quickly as possible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah. There&#39;s no way we can let the enemy procure any other Servants that materialize from the fog.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash, Fujimaru, I&#39;m counting on you. Make sure you stop the Helter Skelters for good this time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But, having said that,we&#39;ve got Fran on our side. We can dodge the enemy.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Do the same thing as last time. Head straight to the remote without encountering enemies.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right. Let&#39;s hurry, but be careful no to let our guard down.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I won&#39;t. Then again, thinking of Fran&#39;s precision last time—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, we&#39;re running into them already? We haven&#39;t reached the remote-controlled ones yet, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Machine sounds ahead. Several large-type units! It&#39;s an enemy group. Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Enemy group defeated. It seems like we&#39;re being attacked more frequently.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The enemy just keeps on coming...Fran, what&#39;s wrong? Are you not feeling so good?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So next we head east...Seems like you&#39;re pointing in more directions than before.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If something&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s okay to say so. Like I said, just be frank with us.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We defeated the enemy group. We believe the attack frequency has been rising.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, is this—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s probably Fran.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, I suppose so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe the properties of the magical circuits changed?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know. But, if you allow me to state...my personal theory...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I do believe that...Fran is the cause. She&#39;s hesitating when it comes to directional commands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right...Fran?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Fran. We need to talk.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You have no intention of leading us to the remote, do you? It&#39;s obvious at this point.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that true? Fran—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah. She&#39;s hesitating about something. One more thing.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There&#39;s something she hasn&#39;t told us. Right, Fran?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh.... Uhh, uh, uh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Look, I&#39;ve said this so many times now. You haven&#39;t forgotten, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If you have something on your mind or something to say, be frank with us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s okay to talk to us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We want you to tell us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh...uhh...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh...ah...ah...ah, ah...uhh...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uhh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Oh. Right. That&#39;s what it was.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is she saying?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t understand...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She knows a man named Babbage. She has apparently even talked to him in person.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She can trace the magical energy because she&#39;s tracing something resembling his presence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, he is not the type to do these kinds of things. That&#39;s what she&#39;s saying.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mr. Jekyll said just as much. I also should have noticed at that point...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...I get it. You&#39;re covering for him. Isn&#39;t that right, Fran?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But, your own actions are contradictory. Babbage isn&#39;t the type to do &quot;these kinds of things,&quot; right?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well then, it&#39;s simple.... I hate to quote that stupid brat, but I have no choice.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Fran. Calm down. Try using your imagination. You can do that much, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Babbage isn&#39;t the type to act like this. Yet, Helter Skelters are wandering around everywhere.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So, that means he&#39;s being forced into this. To do &quot;these kinds of things. &quot;</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Okay, good girl. So, you understand what you need to do, right?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That settles it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s find the remote this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —It&#39;s close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I can tell, too. The magical energy is concentrated here, even in the Demonic Fog.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Look, over there. I&#39;m sure Fujimaru will also hear it soon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I detected it here as well! It&#39;s a giant response,and almost right in front of you. To think it was there!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh, it was in the center of the City Area. It was right near the apartment.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well then, it&#39;s time for us to meet. Either it&#39;s the other remote, or—</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> —Listen, listen, listen! I am the King of Steam.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Unable to grasp the future that lay within reach,I am the king of an evanescent world of fantasy.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> I am known to you rabble as the mage &quot;B&quot;. I am a mastermind behind &quot;Project Demonic Fog&quot; that&#39;s enveloping this city.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Furthermore—I am a Heroic Spirit emerged from the Demonic Fog of the empire&#39;s capital.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Mage &quot;B? &quot;</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...One of the enemy bosses, huh. Damn, I didn&#39;t see that coming.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> True, your name starts with &quot;B. &quot; I see. I was overthinking and missed something so simple.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> However, this...Is the same shape as a Helter Skelter?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> This guy&#39;s specs are probably way higher. Just a hunch, but my hunches are usually right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He does not seem human. So he must be...a Servant!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> I am the King of Steam. Having died once, I now dwell within a world of fantasy.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> My fantasies have sublimated to a Reality Marble,but it&#39;s not enough. It&#39;s not enough. It&#39;s still not enough.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Behold how I desire. Behold how I struggle.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> With steel, I seek to lead a steam-filled civilization. With ideas, I seek to lead an inconceivable civilization.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> And—I lament the incineration of humanity and civilization, of the world and the future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, so that&#39;s it! It means that he himself is already a Reality Marble!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s similar to the Magical Tome. Though, the Magical Tome distributed sleep to materialize.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He will continue to disperse his alter egos infinitely. Most likely, that&#39;s—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mr. Babbage. If what you say is the truth,we can reason with each other.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We are the same. The future should not be burned to ashes!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Enough gabbing. Listen up, you big piece of scrap iron.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The daughter of someone you know has come to stop you.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Listen to what she has to say. Your pompous speeches and everything can come after that.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh...uhh, ah...ah, ah!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Ah, ah, ah!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> —Oh, I see. I could never forget Victor&#39;s daughter. —Are you there?</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Lovely little artificial human. Piteous being unloved by your creator, thus craving love.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Ah, I can hear your words. Ah, I can hear your thoughts.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> That&#39;s right—I...no, we, must fulfill our aspirations as scholars.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> We exist for the sake of humanity and civilization. Thus, I sought...a fantasy world, a new era of dreams.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Thus...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Gah!?</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> ...Ugh...uh...ughh, ugh...ugh!? What...is this...Angrboda&#39;s interference!?</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> The Holy Grail that was implanted! I see, so &quot;M&quot;...so even I!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Victor&#39;s daughter! Run...for your life!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Enough, Fran.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You said what needed to be said,and he replied in his own way. You did a good job.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But, sometimes it ends up like this. Your feelings don&#39;t get conveyed, and you must settle things with swords...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Sometimes it just turns out this way.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Arghh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Here he comes!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Communication breakdown, and now a battle!? This is a similar reaction when a Command Spell has been used—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If this is the Holy Grail&#39;s doing, then we have no choice but to defeat him. Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, your orders. Commencing battle with a large-type Servant!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We have no choice!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s stop him!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> ...Head to the underground part of the city.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> ...Deep, deep, deep beneath the Underground, in the depths...There...lies the core of...&quot;Project Demonic Fog&quot;...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> The source of the Fog...covering the city...Namely, my invention...Massive Steam Engine Angrboda...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> The Holy Grail...was used as the power source for...Angrboda...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh...uhh...ah.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> ...Sorry, daughter of Victor.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> I heard your voice...but I am no longer a human...with a proper life...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> ...but an improbable Servant...of irrelevant thoughts...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> ...I...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> ...Oh, I have seen a dream of my world......But...Even that...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> ...Even in a world where my dream will not be realized...I do not wish to end your world...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Looks like we have the next destination.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, underground. That&#39;s what Mr. Babbage told us.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Let&#39;s get Fran back to Jekyll&#39;s apartment first. Then we&#39;ll take out the final boss.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re surely getting that Holy Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, Senpai.</p><h2 id="section-11-angrboda" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-angrboda" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11: Angrboda</h2><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Under Londinium, huh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I knew there was a subway underground, but who&#39;d have thought there&#39;d be something &quot;under&quot; that.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And how dense this Demonic Fog is...Isn&#39;t it getting thicker the lower we go?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m not sure. I can&#39;t observe from here,but if it&#39;s getting dense enough to visually confirm...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then maybe what Babbage said was true. After all, there really was a path leading below.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why is this here in London?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Was this made by the Mage&#39;s Association?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> London has had an underground transportation network since the middle of the 19th century.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But there are no records of underground passages like this.... Perhaps the remnant of a national top secret project?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Mage&#39;s Association only excavated the area right under the British Museum...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hard to think an individual secretly built an underground labyrinth, so maybe this existed before London took shape?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There&#39;s this old story. Deep underneath the Tower of London—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The head of an ancient king of Britain named Bran is buried, and it watches over Londinium.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A head, huh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Interesting story, huh? The Tower of London has other stories, like the crows.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, I know a bit about that one. They watch over London—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> They&#39;re said to be the avatar of my father, King Arthur. I mean they&#39;re crows! His avatars are crows! Ha ha!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What? I think crows are really cool. Raven Master is really cool, right Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uhh...What do you think, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What? You&#39;re going to ask me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Pretty cool.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. I think so too, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not really cool.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...true. No, I, well...</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Setting crows aside, you can&#39;t track this underground passageway or routes from your end?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry, just as Mash mentioned earlier,there are no records. You&#39;ll have to explore on your own.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hopefully it&#39;s not too complicated...But it already sounds like a labyrinth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Deep underneath London...An unknown underground passage, underground labyrinth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If what Mr. Babbage said was correct,then a &quot;large-scaled machine&quot; should exist.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Massive Steam Engine?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The source of Demonic Fog?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, the source of the Demonic Fog filling London. The Massive Steam Engine Angrboda, powered by a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s what he mentioned right before vanishing. To think a Holy Grail would be integrated into a machine...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But, that makes some sense. The existence of a fog abnormally full of magical energy, and its proliferation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A strange situation that throws off a Servant&#39;s detection ability, and prevents various observations from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see, by using the power of the Holy Grail,something like that would be possible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That may also explain the mechanism that materializes Servants from the Demonic Fog.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By incorporating the Holy Grail into a device,the Demonic Fog gained the ability to summon Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Such speculation is also possible.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But Angrboda, huh? That&#39;s a grand old name.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Angrboda?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The one from Norse mythology.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right, Angrboda is a Divinity from Norse mythology. They brought forth Fenrir, World Serpent, and the Goddess of Death among others.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> With Loki, right? An unbelievable woman giant, but I don&#39;t hate her.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s not often that you see someone give birth to so many troublesome beings—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Definitely worth punching. I&#39;m sure she has thick skin too, so I can get down and hack her into pieces, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Oh, that&#39;s what you meant by &quot;don&#39;t hate her&quot;...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (It&#39;s been so hard to retort to all this...I&#39;m sure Mordred is saying everything on purpose)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Y-Yes. I believe Mordred&#39;s mother was...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Yeah. A witch among witches. None other than Morgan! )</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Looks like they&#39;re finally here. Hostiles.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Beat me to it again. Detecting multiple targets! Looks like there aren&#39;t any more Helter Skelters.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Quality aside, they&#39;re coming in large quantities! Be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger that. Master, starting combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...We&#39;ve come pretty far down. This is the second level, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve travelled pretty far. We&#39;re most likely under Hyde Park now.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh brother. We&#39;ve walked quite a bit...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m mapping the whole thing here. You shouldn&#39;t be traveling in circles, at least.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Taking into account Fujimaru&#39;s stamina,you should probably take appropriate periods of rest.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;ll get that chance. They&#39;re here again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;ve got enemy signatures. Quite a few! It will be another series of battles. Be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger that. Master, give me you orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...What level are we on now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The fourth level. We went down a set of stairs earlier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re currently several hundred meters underground.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We&#39;ve gone pretty deep. Isn&#39;t it going to be a pain to go back up?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...More hostiles again. It really is quantity over quality.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, give me your orders. Going to demolish the enemy group!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What the hell is this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Almost identical to the Fuyuki Greater Grail. Incredible magical energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So much magical energy, I can feel it strongly even in the Demonic Fog. Such a giant Magical Reactor Core...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can observe it here, too. This is amazing. No doubt about it, &quot;that&#39;s&quot; what&#39;s creating the Fog.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;ve never seen a machine this big. Angrboda...The name of a giant fits perfectly.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;d love to take a closer look—But it looks like the last boss is here.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> —Oddly enough.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Oddly enough, it is just as Paracelsus said. Evil must be stopped by those who do good.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> The Massive Steam Engine, Angrboda. This is our evil embodied, but it is also our hope.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Your path ends here. Good will now be destroyed by our evil.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You folks really like to talk. Shut up. What ends here is your life.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Heroic Spirit Mordred. The 13th Knight of the Round Table and legendary Treacherous King.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I thought you&#39;d stand with us,but it seems you&#39;re now a hero of good. Ironic.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you &quot;M&quot;?</p><hr><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I am Makiri Zolgen. The first leader of this &quot;Project Demonic Fog. &quot;</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> One mage seeking the annihilation of this era—the Fourth Singularity, by releasing Demonic Fog all over England.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All of England!? So it&#39;s not just London! That&#39;s...I have to say, going to be tough...</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Destroying London alone isn&#39;t enough. Only by destroying this era completely can I erase the Foundation of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> That is our King&#39;s wish, and an act which we had no choice but to embrace after our surrender.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Our King...Master, is he part of the same group as Lev Lainur?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you&#39;re with Lev!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who is &quot;Our King&quot;!?</p><hr><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> There&#39;s no need to say another word. Angrboda is shifting to overload mode.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> A powerful Heroic Spirit, one sufficient to truly awaken the Demonic Fog that fills the city, will now materialize.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> A single strike from him shall activate the Demonic Fog,engulfing the world. &quot;Everything&quot; will meet its end.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Now, behold. The Heroic Spirit we desire shall appear from the Demonic Fog shortly.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> A Pioneer of the Star, fitting for the end of the Myth of Humanity. Or perhaps, this planet&#39;s glimmer—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I ain&#39;t letting that happen. I&#39;ll kill you, and destroy Angrboda.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;ll never forgive someone other than myself for trampling over Britain. Even if you are a human.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?!?!? He&#39;s not...a Servant!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Just a hunch. I told you they&#39;re usually right, remember? He&#39;s human.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s rightfully from this era, or &quot;shifted&quot;like Babbage was.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Why are you doing this, Makiri Zolgen? Why are you destroying the era you live in—</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Of course, I tried to resist. But I realized everything was useless.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Even if I wished for the salvation of all humanity,the world where they should live has already been incinerated.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Past, present, and future. Our King has decided not to allow them to exist.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> —All will be destroyed before it is achieved.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> The King has proclaimed to us that he tires of seeing more of this ugliness and existence.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Then, before long...</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> No, there&#39;s nothing left to say. With the power of our King I shall destroy you.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> You will die here, without seeing the last Heroic Spirit. Come forth from the sky of destruction, our Demon God!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What!? This presence, this mass magical energy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s summoning a Demon God! Just like the last two!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> One of the 72 Demon Gods. Demon God Barbatos—This is the form of our evil.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> My King has &quot;found&quot; my evilness. The ugliness lurking within me as I desire human salvation.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> With the epitome of my abomination—Begone, you who seek to spread good as I once did!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Demon God Barbatos has gone completely silent. We&#39;ve won.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t let your guard down.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That was a weird monster. That was hard even for me to fight.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Now all that&#39;s left is to smash this big thing. Let&#39;s do it, Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> ...It&#39;s too late. There&#39;s enough Demonic Fog...filling London...already...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You&#39;re still alive? You&#39;re tough.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Now...Come, my last Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Pioneer of the Stars...who can complete my evil!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> ...Thou who are trapped in a cage of madness...and I the summoner who holds thy chains—</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Seventh Heaven clad in the great words of power! Come forth from the circle of binding, guardian of scales!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is...A Heroic Servant summoning incantation!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Shut your mouth!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Shut up and die.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, his last words were a Heroic Servant summoning incantation. With...the phrase causing Madness Enhancement.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Unfortunately, you&#39;re right. Mash, Fujimaru, incoming Servant!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He didn&#39;t use the full spell, but the Demonic Fog served as the circle and the rest of the incantation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can see the Servant response clearly from here. Mash should feel it too. This is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A Great Hero-class magical energy response. No—</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> See? I sacrificed my life for this summoning, and it succeeded...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You&#39;re still alive!? You&#39;re human, right? How can you be so tough—</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> Magical energy of the Holy Grail, amplified by Angrboda...The power of the Demonic fog...all concentrated onto &quot;him&quot;...</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong> ...He has reached the realm of the gods!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The magical energy response is huge! It&#39;s coming!</p><h2 id="section-12-myth-of-thunder-and-lightning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12-myth-of-thunder-and-lightning" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 12: Myth of Thunder and Lightning</h2><p><strong>H：???:</strong> —You called me, did you not?</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong> What was it that called me, lightning itself?

This was just a few minutes ago.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nikola Tesla. He&#39;s known for being a scientist and inventor, isn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you define the modern era as an electricity-based machine civilization, then you can say he created its &quot;foundation. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Just like he said,you could call him a Pioneer of the Stars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He was supposed to be alive in this era,but he&#39;s been summoned as a Servant?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yup. Looks like there&#39;s similar cases in the past. Where one of them is a human, the other&#39;s a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But the human Nikola Tesla has nothing to do with that. We just have to stop his materialization as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The powerful lightning that he automatically brings to his surroundings will instantly activate the Demonic Fog.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If he gets to a place where the fog is especially dense,what&#39;s happening in London will spread explosively.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then it won&#39;t just be in London. It&#39;ll cover all of Britain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If that happens,we&#39;ll be unable to restore Humanity in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Foundation of Humanity will be completely destroyed, and human history will end in this era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...just what Makiri Zolgen said would happen, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We just need to give that lightning guy a good beatdown,right? Nice and simple.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Normally a Heroic Spirit that appears from the fog doesn&#39;t automatically become our enemy, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In his case, Makiri&#39;s incantation has had a small effect similar to Madness Enhancement.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He&#39;s not a pure Berserker. But his mind and actions are limited.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> When I spoke to him via the comms,he did respond—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But there was a sense that his actions were controlled. If we don&#39;t stop him he&#39;ll automatically go for the Fog.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s stop him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s chase him.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai. By the way...are you hurt?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru&#39;s vitals are fine, thanks to Mash promptly giving cover. More importantly...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah. Enemies. Weak ones. Their Master is gone. How faithful of them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, your orders. We&#39;ll destroy the enemy!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Incoming, it&#39;s another homunculus! It&#39;s needlessly huge!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Maybe it absorbed too much fog and grew? No, that&#39;s not it. Maybe an effect of the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Forget that! We have to fight it! Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> More! Dammit, we can&#39;t get anywhere like this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Let&#39;s try and break through somehow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s supposedly walking,so he can&#39;t have gone that far!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If he was going full speed as a Servant, the Demonic Fog would have expanded by now and the world would be doomed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Does that mean...He&#39;s trying to help us? Maybe?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Enough talking! Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...We&#39;re through! Hurry!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The response is coming from right over there! I mean literally! He&#39;s right there!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even if his actions are controlled, can we assume he&#39;s on our side, mentally? ...No, we don&#39;t know that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You should assume it&#39;ll be a fight. He&#39;ll attack anyone who tries to stop him!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger. —Master, I see him up ahead. It&#39;s Nikola Tesla!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> You&#39;re here! Heroes of hope, reaching out to the future.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Unfortunately, I must fight you! That&#39;s how my current existence has been created.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> And what&#39;s more—</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> I have power in this manifestation. So I want to try something I&#39;ve been thinking about.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What? The Demonic Fog is tinged with lightning?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This is...not good...The Demonic Fog has enough electricity in it to easily kill a human.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> This is what it means to activate the fog. It absorbs even a Servant&#39;s magical energy without limit!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Of course, I&#39;m an exception! The Activated Fog absorbs your magical energy upon approach!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> It&#39;s possible it will even absorb your Spirit Cores. Now, will you still approach me?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> If you want to defeat me, first you must completely remove this Activated Fog—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can&#39;t get close—? Doctor, there&#39;s nothing we can do like this.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We just need to blow away the fog, right? It&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If it absorbs magical energy, it&#39;ll work out somehow,even if I blast it at full power. Here I go!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Clarent—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Blood Arthur!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Releasing the Noble Phantasm&#39;s True Name! Good,a majority of energy was absorbed but the fog dispersed!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s not totally gone, so it&#39;ll come back soon,but you&#39;ve brief window where you can fight him!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> That power, that sword—It is without a doubt Clarent!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Hahaha! Then that girl is Mordred,an old Heroic Spirit of the Earth.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Perfect! While I&#39;m at it,I&#39;ll destroy every Heroic Spirit of Heaven and of Earth!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Old myths are unnecessary! Only &quot;Humans and the Star&quot;Heroic Spirits should exist beyond the age of electricity!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Come then! Remnants of fantasy, ancient myths fading so fleetingly!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger! Master, prepare for anti-Servant combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —The fog&#39;s coming back! We&#39;ll have to temporarily retreat, Master!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Dammit! The fog&#39;s in the way and my magical energy can&#39;t reach him! I can&#39;t hit him!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Hmph. You were doing well, but you&#39;re out of time! Hahahaha! Poor ancient Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Enough fun for now, then! This genius heads once more for London&#39;s skies.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> ...Oh, yes. While my temperament is a little different than usual...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> I am supposed to be a Heroic Spirit that loves humanity. Thus, I will tell you this, human.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> After reaching the surface, I&#39;ll head to the densest part of the Demonic Fog, likely the skies above Buckingham Palace.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> A single strike of my lightning there will truly activate the Demonic Fog, and swallow everything–</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Everything. Yes, literally all of creation!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> It&#39;ll destroy the cancer of civilization, strip the land of its ostentation, and burn away this island with inviolate lightning!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> With this Singularity as the origin,the rest of humanity is destined to be incinerated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> However! However—</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> If you are still not giving up,follow me. Try and stop me, heroes!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> You are about to face me, the new God of Thunder, who created an era and a civilization with new mythology.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> So strike me down,with the manifestation of an even newer myth!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> There is no other way! Haha—hahahaha! Hahahahhahaha!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wait! Nikola Tesla!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> ...London, huh? It&#39;s been so long.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> I had aspired to be a British gentleman,and now I&#39;m forced to play the role of world destroyer.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> I never would&#39;ve thought it would happen. However—</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Haha! I, the myth, the pioneer of a new age, am destroying electric civilization and human history itself!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> It&#39;s ironic, and hilarious! Haha! Hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Come! I proceed to the heavens! Grant me footing leading me to the fated spot in the sky where the Fog is densest!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> The Perkūnas&#39;s Ladder answer my call! I shall allow them to take me there!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Hahahahahaha! Hahaha! Is there no one left who can stop me?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> —Stop laughing and get your ass down here, then. It&#39;s easy, right?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Oh—?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Hmm. The lightning is crying. This is...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> &quot;Golden&quot; shines from a strike of lightning—</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Somebody&#39;s calling me. They tell me to destroy evil, and kill the demon.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Shut up—</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Shut up, shut up! Stop whispering in my ear! I always swing my own axe, and that&#39;s that!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I will beat down any and all evil! —The shining broad-axe, Golden!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I don&#39;t want to give you my name, but I will. Sakata Kintoki, Heroic Spirit—here to save the day.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> You in that ugly jacket. Those stairs are a traffic violation. Run along home and cry like a little girl.</p><h2 id="section-13-beyond-the-fog" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-13-beyond-the-fog" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 13: Beyond the Fog</h2><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> This is a &quot;doomed world&quot; situation, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> My sense of smell is always accurate. If we don&#39;t stop you, the world&#39;s in trouble, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Seems you want to head to the sky. If that happens, the world&#39;s all messed up from fog and lightning on top of fire.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Wonderful. Your understanding is as sharp as lightning,and just as quick!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Correct. The world ends if you don&#39;t stop me!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> But—Oh, I see. My oh my. Some things are truly interesting.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> A truly fascinating case. The lightning acted as catalyst for the Demonic Fog to summon a new Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Sakata Kintoki, you said? Seems you&#39;re another hero opposing the creation of a new legend.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> If you were a Heroic Spirit of Heaven or Earth from old myths, I&#39;d have burned you up with a laugh, but you&#39;re...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> &quot;A Heroic Spirit of the Humans,&quot; huh?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> You&#39;re one trying to hinder my path. You&#39;re someone willing to fight next to humans.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, Sakata Kintoki? No, I suppose I should call you Mr. Golden. I shall. No, I must.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Yes, you could be none other than Golden! Dazzling, just like plasma!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> You don&#39;t look it, but you&#39;re quite fun, yourself. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re so reasonable!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> A genius always understands what someone says and means. Even with a Madness Enhancement skill cast on him!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> But, ha, ha! I cannot hold back. Let me show you a piece of Nikola Tesla&#39;s genius!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Now that&#39;s just golden! I&#39;ll show you the ace up my sleeve, as well—</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hi there. Excuse me. Could you stop for a moment?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> This is London, right? The city of fog, London, right?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Where&#39;s the dreamy double-decker buses? Where&#39;s the British Museum, Clock Tower, St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> What&#39;s with this ominous fog? Why isn&#39;t there anyone here, even though it&#39;s midday?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> And where are the fish and chips I was looking forward to? And that afternoon tea I was secretly yearning for?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> What about the scones? Clotted cream? Fortnum &amp; Mason&#39;s flagship store?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> A majority of this area feels abandoned, no?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Mikon? Is London facing swift annihilation or something?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I tagged along to vacation in London so I could rehearse my honeymoon with my Master, and this is what I get?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Now Kintoki, did you trick me? Are you making a fool out of a god?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Ah...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> This is—</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Unmistakably a Heroic Spirit of Earth. No, of Heaven? This genius can discern this presence. An old legend!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> But, ah...But...But—What a stunningly beautiful lady!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Mikko?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Even if already an inglorious resident of old legends, I,Nikola Tesla, will treat a lovely lady with utmost courtesy.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> A beautiful lady that represents the Orient. It&#39;s dangerous here. You should fall back, a bit.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> What a nice, splendid spirit—No, I am devoted to my Master, so I cannot.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> But your heart seems not so splendid. Did you get hit with a Madness Enhancement skill?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> And you seem to be wise, as well. How wonderful. It&#39;s slightly different, but you&#39;re correct, My Lady.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> My words hold no meaning. I merely here to accomplish one act, contrary to my words!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Oh, how I do hate myself! Because I am a genius,my thoughts and my actions are disconnected—!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I think that describes most men—Which is bad. What do you plan to do?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> That depends on you! Lady, I do not mind if the two of you take me on!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Then I&#39;ll do just that☆ Now, Kintoki. Let&#39;s get this over quickly so I can continue the trip!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll continue the trip by myself,so I won&#39;t be tying you down, Kintoki☆</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> That helps. But wait,you just took a free ride on my summons...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> How about we talk about this later? Look over there. That hottie over there is already ready to fight, no?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Um, Kintoki? You stopped talking all of a sudden and averted your gaze. What&#39;s wrong? (push)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Your face—</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> It&#39;s way too close to mine—No, If you can, stick to support. I&#39;ll do the punching.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> It&#39;ll be a great fight. We&#39;re both men of lightning. Let&#39;s make some sparks fly, Nikola Tesla!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hm? It looks like Nikola Tesla has stopped.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Suddenly, for some reason. He shouldn&#39;t have reached skies above Buckingham Palace yet.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That means we can still catch up. That&#39;s good. I might get a chance for another fight!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, we should head to the surface now! Let&#39;s hurry, Master!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And now there&#39;s a big group coming this way! They should just run away now that they&#39;re free!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Multiple hostile signals! Fight your way through the battles!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> —I see why you&#39;re the son of the lightning god!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> You&#39;re doing great in the Activated Fog! A normal Servant would have had their Spirit Core eaten away!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> I expect nothing less from a Heroic Spirit of Humans invited by my Lightning Fog, you stand for man&#39;s hope! But, haha, hahaha!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Your Spirit Core—There&#39;s already some cracks forming!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> You won&#39;t last much longer! At this rate,you will only be burned by my lightning, and shatter!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Well if that isn&#39;t golden—You should calm down that fog a bit more!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Can you stop ordering me around!? Only my Master can speak that way to me!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Besides, I&#39;ve been providing support this entire time. Spells just don&#39;t work well on that fog.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Your face is so close! ...Come on! Fox, I&#39;m counting on you, so let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> You&#39;re our last chance! God of Arms, I seek aid facing enemies!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hmm, am I being worshipped? Is this worship?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Mm, truly beautiful...That smile is like a sparkle from the sun, burning my heart!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Foxy Lady! You may be able to stand alongside my legend!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Mikko? There&#39;s someone worshipping me here, too?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I&#39;m really popular around here—W-Wait, no. My Master has to be the one.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> A-Anyway, keep up your support! It&#39;s almost time.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I&#39;m gonna ruin that nice suit of his. Now—time to slam you with my super attack!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> —I&#39;ll blow you away! Special move:</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Golden Spark!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We&#39;re at the surface, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hmm? Somebody&#39;s here. A man and a woman. They&#39;re not dead, so are they Servants?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Looks like they&#39;re Servants that appeared from the fog. I see two of them. They don&#39;t look like enemies.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Hey, are you guys the heroes he was talking about?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter if we&#39;re heroes or not. More importantly, it sounds like you fought him.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Yeah...I can tell you this. We got rid of &quot;all&quot; that pain in the ass fog.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Now it&#39;s up to you guys. I&#39;ll let you grab the glory...or whatever...Gonna rest. Whew...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Well, with so much magical energy drained from you as you fought, utter exhaustion and near death are to be expected.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> But you did wonderfully. You truly are one of Raikou&#39;s Four Kings, whose might shakes the heavens.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> You too. Thanks for the help! Whew...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...But you just looked away, didn&#39;t you? You did. Why? Is your worship a lie?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Eh, I did not. Sure you&#39;re not imagining it?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> (Those boobs! I can see your boobs, Fox! I don&#39;t know where am I supposed to look, get it!? )</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyway, this is a big help. We&#39;ve got a chance now. Without the Activated Fog we can fight him head on!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Now we just have to catch up and slay him. Okay,let&#39;s follow him, Mash, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are we going up those stairs?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, they&#39;re made with a type of magecraft...It seems, anyway. We can walk on them.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s scary to think about them disappearing halfway up. But we&#39;ll deal with that if it happens.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Looks like there&#39;s no time to rest.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah, we&#39;re gonna run up those stairs! Even if they might disappear partway!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s probably a magical staircase created by Nikola Tesla. Who knows how long it will last...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;ll take care of that if it happens. There&#39;s no time to waste, just like you said.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I&#39;m counting on you guys! Don&#39;t screw this up!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Huh? Is that all we get to do?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> This feels like when you trip the metal detector at a security checkpoint!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —We caught up to him! This time, he&#39;s ours!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve sighted Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla once more. He&#39;s walking towards the sky above Buckingham Palace!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We defeat him here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The Activated Fog that was around him</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. The Activated Fog is gone. That golden Servant was right!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> So you&#39;re here—So you truly will try to build a new legend?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> But sadly, that&#39;s impossible. Even without Activated Fog, my lightning is far too strong.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Why? Because I am a genius. Why? Because I am the lightning.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> What is a god—Yes, what is a god? A god is the lightning.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Since ancient times, many men have believed this,and in fact...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Even setting Zeus and Indra aside, it is indeed a god. Lightning, a divine power striking from the heavens.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Behold. The light I bring to the earth is great power itself!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Energy guiding a new electric, consumer civilization! My lightning is the final farewell to the old era and its myths!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> It is a new myth! It is &quot;my light,&quot; a gift unto humanity!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Now,I shall display to all of you!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> –System Keraunos!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Enemy Servant defeated!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> My lightning won! Too bad, Nikola Tesla!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Haha...! Hahaha, Hahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> No, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad at all! I am a Pioneer of the Stars!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> I would never truly wish for humanity&#39;s end. The Heroic Spirits of Heaven and Earth are still a nuisance—</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> But continuation of the world means continuation of my lightning civilization! Thank you, you who desire new myths!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Heroes of hope! You have done well to defeat me, the modern Zeus!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> And so now it is time for me to return to the Throne—</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Haha! Hahahahaha! Farewell, all of you—</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> —Farewell!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The enemy Servant has completely disappeared.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Sheesh, he said whatever and did whatever he pleased until the very end.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ve confirmed Nikola Tesla&#39;s annihilation. Good work. That should take care of things.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What we&#39;re standing on was formed by his magical energy,so it should become unstable shortly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a very powerful effect, so it shouldn&#39;t disappear immediately...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> First we need to get safely back to the ground. This should take care of London&#39;s problems—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Oh. Right. Crap.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is it, Doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think we forgot something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...What about the Holy Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah. We forgot to get the Holy Grail from Angrboda. N-No, it&#39;s not our fault. We were in a hurry. Yeah!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You can take your time getting it. The only enemies left are wimps.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s right. I don&#39;t know how I feel about going back underground.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Let&#39;s go get it now, then. There&#39;s no sense going back to Jekyll&#39;s apartment.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Wait. Looks like something&#39;s showed up after all. What is it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A high-density magical energy response? It&#39;s so big I can see it in the Demonic Fog...What the...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s different from Nikola Tesla&#39;s response,but the fog is gathering above Buckingham palace!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Something real bad is coming! Be careful, Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter what comes! I&#39;ll hack them all apart!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Bring it!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That&#39;s......No, she is definitely...King Arthur!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She&#39;s absorbing the remaining Demonic Fog as she manifests! This is bad! There&#39;s so much magical energy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks like she has a spear, not a sword...A swirling black lance...what twisted magical energy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You feel the magical energy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wasn&#39;t your detection weaker?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I can tell...Magical energy so big I can sense it even with Demonic Fog...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s similar to when Nikola Tesla manifested. But it&#39;s more clear—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can feel her animosity. It&#39;s a blind rage and hatred, like a Berserker!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Is she under the effect of Makiri Zolgen&#39;s incantation? Then even if we can talk to her, we&#39;ll still have to fight.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...We probably can&#39;t talk. That&#39;s King Arthur, ready to slay her foes.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Why...Why are you appearing now? If you&#39;re saving Londinium, you should have come sooner...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...No, maybe it&#39;s different.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Maybe you&#39;re here to kill me. Do you not like the idea of me saving Londinium?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Do you hate me that much? Is that why you&#39;ve got the spear that killed me—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The spear that killed Mordred? Th-That&#39;s a Divine Construct, said to rival the holy sword!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Rhongomyniad, the holy spear! The legendary spear that&#39;s said to hold the two sides of the world together!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You already fought one battle with a powerful Servant. You need to retreat, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> No, not happening. King Arthur has decided we are enemies.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There&#39;s no getting away. We have to fight.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...No, you can run if you want. But there&#39;s a 90% chance you&#39;ll get blown away.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m not running.... I&#39;m not turning my back on my father.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> King Arthur is right in front of me! So there&#39;s only one thing for me to do!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;ll fight you! If you hate me, even as a Heroic Spirit!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;ll rebel against you as many times as I have to! —Arthur Pendragon!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s no good! We can&#39;t stop Mordred! I guess we have to fight...Good luck, you two!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Roger!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Master! ...Beginning combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I just got word from Dr. Roman. The operation was a success!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> They defeated Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla,as well as another Servant that appeared from the Fog.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> And just now, they succeeded in removing the Holy Grail from Angrboda.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Huh? Is it just you? Where&#39;s Andersen and Shakespeare—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Oh, I see. That&#39;s right. The Grail&#39;s been recovered. Singularity is fixed. Then, yup.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> The era is being restored. Everything that happened here will disappear.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> All the Servants will disappear,and our memories will probably change as well.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh, uh, uh...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Yes...Yes. I see. Just this once, I think I understand what you&#39;re saying.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...Uh...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...Yes, you&#39;re right. It is a little sad.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well, you know—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Good work. You guys helped with a lot.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Londinium is saved. No one other than me could trample it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And they all lived happily ever after. Bye.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um, Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll tell you...one thing. That last Servant was clearly out of control.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was probably the unique result of the Demonic Fog and Makiri Zolgen&#39;s last incantation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It didn&#39;t come here for any special reason or anything like that, I think.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...What? Are you trying to make me feel better?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Give it up. I don&#39;t want to end this by killing you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, that&#39;s not it. I...No...That&#39;s not...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She said what she wanted to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Haha, I get it! I see! That&#39;s what I&#39;ve said so many times!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah, you&#39;re right. You&#39;ve got me there.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Okay, I won&#39;t kill you then. Dammit, I should&#39;ve kept my mouth shut around Fran.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh? Isn&#39;t that a little too kind for the Treacherous Knight?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I understood your character as being someone who slays anyone who offers pity, regardless of who it may be.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Nope. She&#39;s just easily taken in by a certain type of person. You can tell by looking at Fran, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...You&#39;re showing up after it&#39;s all over, huh? Fine. Line up so I can chop your heads off.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Huh? I came to help you out of this latest danger,and I&#39;m finding a bunch of weirdos.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Are those two Servants? Do you need my help?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hahh, Hahh...Oh, jeez. Hold up, Kintoki. You&#39;re a little too fast—Geh.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Hmph. I think I may have seen those fox ears somewhere before...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Saber, if you want to kill Shakespeare, very well. But first, listen to me.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> You&#39;ll want to defeat that fox-eared girl first. I don&#39;t know why, but I can see she&#39;s a hassle to deal with!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;m killing you, too!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> You really have it out for me,don&#39;t you? Hmmph, precocious brat!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hahaha. Sounds like you&#39;re busy. Well, the case is closed, so this is fit for a grand finale.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah. Everybody&#39;s so friendly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Doctor, we need to recover the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Oh, right. We need to finish recovering the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s no more threats in this era, so I wasn&#39;t...Wait. What&#39;s this response!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Everyone, be careful! There&#39;s some kind of distortion in the underground space!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;Something&quot; is coming! It&#39;s an unknown phenomenon! Not a Servant manifestation!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Unknown? No, it&#39;s actually more like a Rayshift? But that&#39;s impossible. Only Chaldea has that technology!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? ...Senpai, something is strange. I have no anomalies, but I&#39;m shivering—terribly—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...The space is opening! Here it comes!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Demon Marshal Gilles de Rais. Imperial Founder Romulus. Hero Spy Jason. And Divine Scholar Nikola Tesla.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> I thought they would be somewhat useful—But they spoiled my fun as they couldn&#39;t even clean house.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Stupidity. Such stupidity. Humans really do degrade with the passage of time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Dammit! Sheba won&#39;t stabilize! I can only get audio! What happened!? What&#39;s going on, Mash!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s a shadow that looks human,slowly walking towards us—</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...Get back, lady. That thing&#39;s bad news. It ain&#39;t something a good little girl should see.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> So it seems. I&#39;ll be leaving too. With only two tails, even seeing it is enough to taint me.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> (No, you&#39;re probably fine, right? Shouldn&#39;t you be going to the front? )</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> —Hey. What is this insane magical energy? It&#39;s a hell of a lot bigger than a dragon. It&#39;s like—</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> One of the demons or angels in the ancient stories. No, perhaps even greater.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I was not born a mage but as a petty Caster I can understand.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> This magical energy is infinite. This domination crushes its surroundings merely by existing.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Truly, truly a created being worthy of being called God! No, perhaps it is even God itself!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Am I wrong, my friend Andersen? I think it&#39;s time for us to be going!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Why do you always exaggerate so? There&#39;s all types of gods. Anyway, the only god I fear is the god of editors.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...Though I do agree it&#39;s time to run. I didn&#39;t expect to see the big boss at this stage.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The big boss!? What does that mean!? Fujimaru, tell me what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> I see. Like me, only your voice reaches them.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Chaldea is isolated from the temporal axis,and so it&#39;s become a base that no one can find.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> My eyes see everything—and all possible futures,but even they have trouble perceiving Chaldea.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> That&#39;s why you survive. Pathetically, shamelessly, and uselessly.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Intolerant of a history of destruction already decided,a pitiful boat still adrift in the sea of void.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> That is what you are, Chaldea,and what you are, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> A stain upon the scorched ashes of human history. The name of the only fools left who would defy &quot;my&quot; deeds.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Doctor,what we&#39;re about to see is—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you the &quot;King&quot; that Lev talked about?</p><hr><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Hmm? I thought you already had the answer? Are you so like monkeys that such a thing has to be taught?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> But very well. I&#39;ve taken a liking to your stupidity. If you wish to ask, I shall answer you.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> I am the final destination you seek. The one who commands the 72 Demon Gods, and will destroy humanity from his throne.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> My name is Solomon. Among the Heroic Spirits,I stand above them all as one of the &quot;Grand&quot; seven.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> S—Solomon!? Are you sure that&#39;s what he said, Mash!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He said he was Solomon...Same as the king of ancient Israel, who was alive in the 10th century B. C.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No...Is it really Solomon? But...But that&#39;s impossible—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Heh. I guess we&#39;ve got a big name for a guest, huh? So what? Are you a Servant too?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You were summoned as a Heroic Spirit,and decided to use your 2nd life to destroy humanity?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> No, Knight of Londinium. I am indeed a Heroic Spirit, but no man will ever summon me.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Do not think me the same rank as you incompetents. After death, I revived by my own power to be a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> D-Did he say...he revived by his own power!?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> I am a Heroic Spirit, and also a living being. Thus, no Master commands me.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> I started this matter of my own will. In order to eliminate all you humans—</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Trash who&#39;s continuing along its foolish history. You are the sole and greatest waste of this universe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You think you can do that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You can&#39;t destroy the world!</p><hr><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> I can. I have the means,the will, and the reality.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Your eras have been swept away already,by my 72 Demon Gods that cross over time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Cross over time...So those Demon Gods really were the demons in the Lemegeton?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But they&#39;re nothing like those in folklore! King Solomon&#39;s familiars can&#39;t be such ugly meat monsters!</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> How sad. You exist at the far end of time,and yet your interpretation is ancient.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> The 72 Demon Gods took physical form and were reborn. That is why they can anchor themselves in any era.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> The Demon Gods are wedges halting this planet&#39;s rotation. The spiraling band of light in the sky is my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Spiraling band of light in the sky Does he mean...that ring of light we see in every era—</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Indeed. That is my Third Noble Phantasm. &quot;Ars Almadel Salomonis. &quot;</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Each ray in the band carries the same heat as a holy sword. Light equivalent to weaving together hundreds of millions of the holy sword...</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> ...held by King Arthur—the Servant you played with. In other words—an Anti-Humanity Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Tch...Hundreds of millions of times the heat of Father&#39;s holy sword— That&#39;s what you&#39;re using to incinerate time!?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> —Hmph. You&#39;ll never see it, so I&#39;ve no intention of answering.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> I&#39;ve answered your question. Now it&#39;s my turn, survivors of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> He wants a fight! Get ready, Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> He&#39;s the guy behind all this, right!? So our only option is to kill him here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> B-But—That Servant...we can&#39;t—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash, get a hold of yourself! Stay strong and focus on the enemy!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No matter who they are, they&#39;re a Servant, right!? So you can win!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Heroic Spirit within you was chosen by the Holy Grail! He&#39;s a Heroic Spirit who won&#39;t be outranked by Solomon!</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> Hah—the rank of a Heroic Spirit? Do you really think that matters at all?</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> Ignorance is a sin. I thought some knowledge was there,but your commander seems to be a mage of little worth.</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> The only one I&#39;ve any interest in now is you, girl with the shield.</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> Now let&#39;s have a fun little chat.</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> I&#39;ll do you a special favor. Out of respect for your pure heart, I&#39;ll only summon &quot;four of them. &quot;</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Do you see now? This is the inevitable result of a mere Heroic Spirit trying to challenge me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Doctor, use the Rayshift. We&#39;re going to be wiped out!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can&#39;t do it! The field around him is blocking the Rayshift anchor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As long as Solomon&#39;s there,I can&#39;t bring you back!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...At least...I can try to save Senpai—</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That bastard is boasting!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But it&#39;s no bluff...Our ranks don&#39;t matter. His energy output is so much greater.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What the hell are you made of?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> It&#39;s just like you said. It&#39;s not our ranks as Heroic Spirits. Our vessels, our Classes are what separate us.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Now burn, with the rest of the garbage.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Heroic Spirit Mordred, Kingslayer. I will take my time to incinerate you thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...This is crazy. Just blocking him once did this to me? Figures I can&#39;t stand up to you as a Caster.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Brat!? What are you—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Just a whim. Don&#39;t worry about it. I owe you for all the work you&#39;ve done.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> ...You&#39;re still alive, scribbler?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> I thought I cleaned you up with the rest of the rabble. I&#39;m amazed you survived, as weak as you are.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Hmph. I don&#39;t like physical labor, so I focused on watching. But it looks like I can&#39;t do that anymore.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> But—I see through you, Solomon. I see what you really are, and the truth behind your exceptional nature.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Oh? Very well. Speak then, poet. If your words please me, I&#39;ll grant you an easy death.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Yeah, listen well you imbecile. This is what was written in the Clock Tower&#39;s records.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> The Heroic Spirit Summons belong to the Counter Force. And the Counter Force is what protects humanity.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> They manifest in seven vessels,to fight &quot;just one&quot; enemy.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What is that enemy? What else? The great disaster that threatens our world!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It is the avatar of the end, which destroys not this planet,but humanity and the civilization it has built!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It was born from civilization, and devours it—It is none other than a self-inflicted apoptosis.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> To defeat it,the greatest of the Heroic Spirits are summoned.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> —That&#39;s right. The seven Heroic Spirits are messengers from heaven, sent to destroy a certain wickedness.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Seven strongest from that era to protect humanity. The first seven at the pinnacle of Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> The Heroic Spirit Summoning Ritual was originally an ultimate spell meant to save humanity.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> The summoning system you use—the Holy Grail War is a degraded form of it, meant to serve human purposes.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wha—You&#39;re saying we&#39;re degraded?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Don&#39;t fall for his taunts, Mordred. It&#39;s not an issue of rank, but of vessel and authority.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> He is simply a Heroic Spirit manifested in a vessel one rank above our own.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> If we are weapons meant to fight individuals,he is a weapon meant to fight the world—</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> He stands at the top of all Heroic Spirits of his alignment. In other words, he is a Servant with a &quot;Grand&quot; vessel.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Yes. You have done well to reach the truth!</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> I am the King of Kings, the Caster of Casters! You shall refer to me as this!</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> —The Grand Caster, Mage King Solomon!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A Grand Class!? Is he saying he was chosen by the Root!?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> —Now then. Take your reward, poet. I shall tear you into a hundred pieces and burn you to a crisp.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Ggg—Gggawaahhh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...You bastard.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Ordinary Servant, you&#39;re an utterly useless tool unless summoned by the living.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> You lack the true freedom I possess. Do you now see the wall between us that you can never cross?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Tch—Hah. You&#39;re one to talk,considering you lost four Grails already.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You&#39;re only here because you&#39;re panicking that Fujimaru took half of your Grails, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Only losers whine when they get beat, you know?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> —Are you the greatest fool in history?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> I&#39;ve lost four Grails? No. It will only matter if I lose them all.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> One Grail, or six, it makes no difference to me. Fujimaru is far from a threat.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> It&#39;s time for me to go. I wasted more time than I thought.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh!? You&#39;re leaving? Why did you even come here!?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> It was nothing more than a whim. Why?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Sometimes after finishing a book, you go to the bathroom before picking up the next, right? That&#39;s all this was.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What? You&#39;re saying you came to piss on us!?</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> —Hah.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Hahaha, Gwahahaha!</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> That&#39;s right! That&#39;s exactly right! But you&#39;re worth less than piss!</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> I don&#39;t care about you. I could kill you here, or not, and not care at all.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Do you understand? I&#39;m not letting you go. You weren&#39;t worth looking at in the first place.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> But—Hmph. But if you can remove all seven Singularities...</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> ...Then I will consider you&quot;a matter I must deal with. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Are we...saved? I hate to have him let us go, but it&#39;s best to just—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why are you doing this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is incinerating the world fun!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai!</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> —Oh. That&#39;s a surprising reaction, human.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> You ask if it&#39;s fun? You ask me if destroying humanity is fun?</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> Oh—Of course! Of course! Of course! Of course! It&#39;s the greatest fun in the world!</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> If it wasn&#39;t fun,would I take my time killing each one of you?</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> I&#39;m having fun. Your deaths make me happy.</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> Your end pleases me. Your final gasps bring me more joy than anything!</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> And,this is the greatest salvation you could find.</p><p><strong>D：Solomon:</strong> Because only I alone can make good use of every single human being—!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Get back, Fujimaru! There&#39;s no point in talking to him! He&#39;s rotten to the core!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Mage King Solomon. You&#39;re no different than Lev Lainur.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You have no gratitude towards life. You enjoy toying with the lives of humans and of the planet!</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Girl, speak not of life as a mere human. When death is inevitable for you, your view has no value.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Gratitude towards life? That&#39;s my question for you.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> What have you done for the last 2,000 years? You&#39;ve continuously died, and continuously done nothing.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> You are sentient creatures who failed to conquer death. And yet you retain your fear of it.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> If you cannot conquer death,you should have abandoned your fear of it.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> If you understand death to be a shameful, terrifying thing, then you should throw away your sentience!</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> It&#39;s pathetic. Simply pathetic. You&#39;re no different either, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Why do you fight? Knowing your life will end. Knowing it has ended.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Why do you cling to life,when you know that your future holds no salvation?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> You are so young, human. You, Fujimaru, are humanity&#39;s final Master.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> And this is my one warning to you.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> Know that giving up on everything here is the easiest way for you to live.</p><p><strong>Solomon:</strong> —Burn, and leave not even ash. That is your future.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...This is the end. I feel unsatisfactory, though we got the Grail back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Idiot. Don&#39;t you apologize. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s stupid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah. I haven&#39;t been this down since my Father&#39;s spear— No, never mind. Never mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But well, we saved London. Not bad, considering who I am.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What I hate is that it&#39;s ending here. Honestly, I wanted to go with you guys...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But I&#39;m at my limit, as you can see. With the Singularity gone, there&#39;s no place for me.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I was summoned here by the Grail&#39;s fog. Without a Master, I have to disappear.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...I hate to say it, but he&#39;s right. We can&#39;t fight unless we&#39;re summoned.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s the limit of a Heroic Spirit, and a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> In every era, the ones who build things...are always people living on the cutting edge of the future.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Mordred</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Living people...</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah. That&#39;s why—you&#39;re going to get there, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You&#39;ll reach the place we can&#39;t go. You&#39;ll cross over the seven Grails and reach the end of time.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And then you&#39;ll corner that bastard Grand Caster. It&#39;s something only you can do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t make that face, Mash. I don&#39;t like that Shield Bastard, but you&#39;re different.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Someday we&#39;ll meet again. When that happens, I&#39;ll help you.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Bye, Fujimaru. Even someone like me was able to save London.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So with a little bit of work,you&#39;ll be able to save the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...All Servant responses are lost. Senpai, our Order in this era is complete...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ahem. Test, test. Yes! Finally got video.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You two okay? You&#39;re okay, right? None of your vitals seem off.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Demonic Fog is back to normal fog. There&#39;s nothing left for you in that era.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m starting the Rayshift now. Anything left for you to do? Nothing, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, initiating Rayshift! Congrats on completing your mission!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Welcome back, you two. You&#39;re both fine...well, maybe not. But I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> By the way, why are you here, Da Vinci?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Um, where&#39;s Dr. Roman?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Romani? Oh, Romani. He&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> How...How could this happen?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s a mess, as you can see. Go snap him out of it, would you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Get a grip, Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You really are a chicken, huh Doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ywaah!? W-When did you two get here!? ...Oh, right. Leonardo did it for me...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Sorry. You were the ones in danger. It&#39;s just...It was such a shock...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right, right. Enough gloom. They&#39;ll get really tired of it soon, you know?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Y-Yeah...I&#39;m...Sorry, Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I should&#39;ve done a forced Rayshift earlier,but my judgment was too slow...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You couldn&#39;t help it.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But if Solomon had really tried to kill you...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Wah...I&#39;m...I&#39;m no good!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Doctor. No, stop staring at the ground.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We are able to continue our mission because you are here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s true that you&#39;re a bit of a coward,and a pessimist, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re a chicken. And kind of a wimp for a guy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Also, your hobbies are far too introverted,and you&#39;re way too dependent on that cyber-idol.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, show some mercy...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But—The staff left at Chaldea can only do their best because you&#39;re doing your best.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When Chaldea was bombed, you were the one who got the power back up in the fire, saved the survivors, and took command.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You have only one fault. You give yourself just a bit too little credit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Chaldea is only here because of Romani Archaman. You saved the lives of everyone here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s what I think.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You said &quot;what you were thinking. &quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Thanks, Mash, Fujimaru. Then, I don&#39;t have time to be depressed. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We know who&#39;s behind this all now. There must be some reason for his extreme strength.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let&#39;s continue the mission. We&#39;ll fix the remaining Singularities and stop the world and future from incineration.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...No matter what that man,Mage King Solomon, tries to do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Grand Caster. He is our true enemy—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Next time we win!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We won&#39;t lose again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah! That&#39;s the spirit, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, it&#39;s a little late to say this,but great work this time, guys!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;ll handle the cleanup. You guys get some rest, ASAP.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> When you wake up, it&#39;ll be time for the Fifth Singularity. See you then!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We&#39;ve reached our rooms. Senpai, thanks for your endless work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No. I&#39;m a Demi-Servant. Physically, I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you can call exhaustion and drained magical energy...tired...then maybe I am tired.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m not that tired.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...I&#39;m sorry. I meant that more as an idiom.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And I do think you&#39;re tired. Get some rest in your room.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um. I&#39;m sorry. There was something I had to talk to you about.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...What did you think about what Solomon said? About making use of humanity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s stupid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...What did you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I...I couldn&#39;t say that he was wrong.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t understand it myself. But there was something in his words I can&#39;t ignore...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Life is meaningless, and the future holds no salvation...It sounds so pessimistic, but he was full of hope.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry. The battle just got started, and I&#39;m being weird.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good night, Master. I hope I see you bright and full of energy tomorrow.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Singularity/london.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
