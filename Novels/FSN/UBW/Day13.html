id="scene-00" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-00" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 00</h2><p>Well.</p><p>Now we&#39;re drinking tea after dinner.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, projection has its limitations.</p><p>Its power seems unlimited since it makes your imagination real, but projection has its own set of rules.</p><p>The simplest is about the projected object&#39;s durability. The strength of its existence.&quot;[l]</p><p>Tohsaka puts up a finger as she drinks her tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;Strength of its existence...? What? You mean its flimsiness in being unable to bear the existence of the illusion?&quot;</p><p>I sip the tea and tilt my head in wonder.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You seem like you don&#39;t know anything, but you know some interesting terms. ...Well, you&#39;re not right, but not wrong.</p><p>Projection uses your mental image to completely reproduce the genuine object. There is no exception to this.</p><p>You can&#39;t project it if it&#39;s not perfect inside of you. As it is a shadow of the true object, the projection magecraft requires that there be no mistake.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So―――basically, the projected object has the strength as you imagine it. An illusion is perfect in this regard.</p><p>The closer the knowledge and the image are to the true object, the more perfect the projected object is in real life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm? Wait, that&#39;s strange.</p><p>I projected Archer&#39;s swords. But Kuzuki destroyed them.</p><p>I know Caster strengthened Kuzuki&#39;s fists, but they aren&#39;t strong enough to destroy a Noble Phantasm.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t that mean the Kanshou and Bakuya I projected are inferior to the originals?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, you realized a very good point, Emiya-kun.</p><p>That&#39;s the limit of projection, the strength of the object&#39;s existence.</p><p>Projection is just a projection. It&#39;s not creation. What makes the projection is the image in the caster&#39;s mind. So when a flaw is created in the image, the projected object vanishes even if it has the same ability as the original.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? When a flaw is created in the image...? Isn&#39;t that also strange? You can&#39;t project it if the image is incorrect, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. So the flaw would be created after it is projected.</p><p>...Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s say you project a &#39;sword that will not break&#39;.&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Tohsaka nods in satisfaction.</p><hr><p>&quot;But a sword that will not break doesn&#39;t exist.</p><p>It&#39;s just that the sword is famed or called &#39;unbreakable&#39;, so it can break if it comes across an illusion greater than itself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Doesn&#39;t it mean my image was wrong once it breaks? I made a sword that won&#39;t break, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s wrong.</p><p>It&#39;s perfect the moment you project it. First of all, a &#39;sword that will not break&#39; is just a name. There isn&#39;t an actual sword that won&#39;t break.</p><p>But what you imagined is a &#39;sword that won&#39;t break&#39;, right? If this sword breaks in real life, what is projected becomes a lie.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This isn&#39;t because the &#39;sword broke&#39;.</p><p>What you imagined is a &#39;sword that will not break&#39;.</p><p>So when it breaks, the &#39;sword that broke&#39; and the &#39;sword that will not break&#39; in your imagination become two separate things.</p><p>―――It&#39;s because the scales between you and reality tip.&quot;</p><hr><p>...?</p><p>So, if I sum it up...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――All right.</p><p>So, I imagined a sword that would not break and projected it. But the projected sword broke during battle.</p><p>When that happened, I denied the sword, saying &#39;Hey, this sword broke.&#39; As a result, the projected sword disappeared.</p><p>And that&#39;s because there was an inconsistency between reality and the image, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re pretty bright. Yes, you&#39;re right.</p><p>You projected Archer&#39;s swords.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how you ranked Archer&#39;s swords, but you did not imagine swords that would break from Kuzuki&#39;s attacks.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But the swords were destroyed.</p><p>At that time, you thought, &#39;these aren&#39;t Archer&#39;s swords&#39;.</p><p>The projected swords were denied by the maker, so they lost their strength of existence and became a fantasy once again.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>Even projected weapons can break.</p><p>But it&#39;s not the enemy, but you, who make them disappear from this world.</p><p>When the difference between the reality and the image becomes too large to be reconciled, the projected weapon disappears.</p><p>It is because the one who projected the weapon stops believing in the image.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you get it now? So projection starts from the blueprint. You should consider material, properties, and even its history. If you have those down, I don&#39;t think the projected object will disappear right away even if it&#39;s a bit different.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Wouldn&#39;t you start from how it was considered to be made?</p><p>Materials and techniques aren&#39;t enough.</p><p>Let&#39;s take today&#39;s dinner as example. It started when you said you wanted to eat Japanese food, right? So you have to start from the very beginning of the creation.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s stunned.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka stares at me.</p><p>I drink tea and tilt my head in wonder.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, how did we start talking about this in the first place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. I thought we were talking about what our future course of action should be...&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh yeah.</p><p>We were talking about what our course of action should be...</p><p>&quot;Shirou. Do you want to seriously practice projection magecraft?&quot;</p><p>...When Tohsaka derailed the conversation.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I remember now. We were so stumped that we started placing hope on uncertain factors.&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――Yeah.</p><p>First of all, all I can manage to project are swords. That hasn&#39;t helped me too much, so it&#39;s probably not much use.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>Oh, she&#39;s looking at me with those eyes again.</p><p>...I wonder why. She always makes that face when we talk about projection magecraft.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh well. Let&#39;s confirm our current situation.</p><p>For now, our enemy is Caster. She isn&#39;t too bad by herself, but we can&#39;t do anything as long as she&#39;s protected by Kuzuki and Archer.</p><p>Plus, it&#39;s only a matter of time before Saber is controlled. The situation is getting worse by the second――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. But Saber isn&#39;t under Caster&#39;s complete control.</p><p>That gives us a chance of victory.</p><p>There&#39;s no chance of victory once Saber gives in.&quot;</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t let that happen.</p><p>She told me to run.</p><p>She told me as she cried. So for Saber&#39;s sake, I can&#39;t let Caster do as she wishes.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――That&#39;s right.</p><p>So, raise your hand if you have an idea. Shirou, do you have any good ideas?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm――――&quot;</p><p>An idea that will break the current deadlock.</p><p>If there is a way to oppose Caster, it is――――</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01</h2><p>&quot;―――There aren&#39;t any more plans to consider.</p><p>We won&#39;t use any tricks and just fight them head on.&quot;</p><p>I stare at Tohsaka straight in the face.</p><hr><p>&quot;......So.</p><p>Let me ask you just in case. Are you serious?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――Ugh.&quot;</p><p>...This is intense.</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t stunned, but really angry.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sorry, I just said it on a whim. I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t thinking at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. For a second, I thought about breaking my alliance with you, you idiot.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know I&#39;m stupid.</p><p>...So what about you? Do you have a plan?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? ...Well, I do have one, but can I say it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong? You&#39;re timid for once. Just say it if you have a plan.</p><p>I&#39;ll listen to whatever you have to say. Well, I&#39;ll object if it sounds unrealistic.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious that we can&#39;t beat Caster by ourselves, right?</p><p>So we have to increase our force.</p><p>They have three Servants, so we should have at least one.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Increase our force...? Then we&#39;re going to go ask other Masters for help?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s more like cooperation. Caster is a powerful force now, so other Masters can&#39;t just keep watching, right?</p><p>If they want the Holy Grail, we have to collaborate to defeat the most powerful force. We can break the collaboration after that.</p><p>This is a basic tactic in battle royal, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>So we&#39;ll make an alliance of the remaining Masters since Caster is so strong now, huh?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. We might be able to cooperate depending on how the negotiations turn out.[l]</p><p>Then...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, there are two remaining Masters now. Lancer&#39;s Master and Berserker&#39;s Master.</p><p>There&#39;s no way to negotiate with Lancer&#39;s Master because his identity is unknown. But we might have a chance with Berserker&#39;s Master, Illyasviel.&quot;</p><hr><p>Berserker&#39;s Master.</p><p>The white girl and the statue-like giant I met on the night when it all began.</p><p>She sounded dangerous, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s cruel.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. I think she would at least listen to us. I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll ask for much in return, either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――You idiot. She&#39;s the most dangerous for you.</p><p>She was only looking at you, Shirou. I don&#39;t know what she&#39;ll do to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What do you mean? I&#39;ve only met her once, so that can&#39;t be possible. Quit scaring me like that, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Humph. We&#39;ll stop the negotiation right then if that does happen.&quot;</p><p>Then...</p><p>Tohsaka averts her gaze and gulps down her tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But we can only bet on Illyasviel for now. If Archer is right about Caster&#39;s identity, Berserker would be her natural enemy.</p><p>They knew each other when they were alive, so he should know Caster&#39;s tricks. Berserker can handle Caster and Archer by himself. We can take care of Kuzuki while he does so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s an optimistic thought. But does Berserker really know Caster?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, Archer told me that Berserker&#39;s true identity is Hercules.</p><p>If Caster really is that witch, Berserker might know her through the Argo Expedition.</p><p>It&#39;s just like how I don&#39;t get along with Kirei. Everyone has a natural enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Okay.</p><p>But I&#39;m sure everyone would dislike that priest.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Then it&#39;s decided.</p><p>But how should we find her? She hasn&#39;t appeared since that night. We should be able to find her because of her large magical energy, right?</p><p>But we can&#39;t find her in spite of that, so doesn&#39;t that mean she&#39;s not in this town?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;d assume not. Illyasviel must be having fun, watching the Holy Grail War from a faraway place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Faraway place? Is she keeping watch over the town like how Caster was doing at the Ryuudou Temple?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. But I have an idea of where she might be.</p><p>...I heard from my dad that the Einzbern family has a villa in the forest on the outskirts of town.&quot;</p><hr><p>She says so with a tense voice.</p><p>―――A villa inside the forest...</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s expression tells me how dangerous the place is.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02</h2><p>...It&#39;ll just end up like today if we fight them head on.</p><p>As we are inferior, we have to execute a surprise attack to catch them off guard.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. You&#39;re Kotomine&#39;s student, right? Then don&#39;t you know a lot about that church?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Well, I have stayed over at the church a couple of times... Oh, I see.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, but there aren&#39;t any secret passages in that church. That was the first time I&#39;ve seen the underground temple. Even if there is one, Kotomine would be the only one that knows about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I give up. ...Damn, I guess it won&#39;t be that convenient. I thought it would be possible, considering that priest.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But as long as we can&#39;t use it, we have to come up with something else. ...Um, this is a what-if, so can you hear me out?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure... but do you have an idea?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not good enough to be called an idea.[vr]</p><p>Look, it&#39;s obvious that we can&#39;t beat Caster by ourselves, right?[vr]</p><p>So we have to increase our force.</p><p>They have three Servants, so we should have at least one.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s true... but increase our force...?</p><p>Then we&#39;re going to go ask other Masters for help?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s more like cooperation.

Um, do you think it&#39;s feasible to cooperate with other Masters?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......All right, why do you say so? You must have a plan.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s not the case, but Caster isn&#39;t someone the other Masters can just ignore, right?</p><p>So I thought we might be able to cooperate just to beat Caster.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. I was actually thinking of the same thing. I didn&#39;t say it because I thought you&#39;d object.&quot;</p><hr><p>She says so unenthusiastically.</p><p>She must not like the idea, but she must know that&#39;s the only option we have.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, there are two remaining Masters now.

Everyone has a natural enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Okay.</p><p>But I&#39;m sure everyone would dislike that priest.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Then it&#39;s decided.</p><p>But how should we find her? She hasn&#39;t appeared since that night. We should be able to find her because of her large magical energy, right?</p><p>But we can&#39;t find her in spite of that, so doesn&#39;t that mean she&#39;s not in this town?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;d assume not. Illyasviel must be having fun, watching the Holy Grail War from a faraway place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Faraway place? Is she keeping watch over the town like how Caster was doing at the Ryuudou Temple?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. But I have an idea of where she might be.</p><p>...I heard from my dad that the Einzbern family has a villa in the forest on the outskirts of town.&quot;</p><hr><p>She says so with a tense voice.</p><p>―――A villa inside the forest...</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s expression tells me how dangerous the place is.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-04" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 04</h2><p>I run down the stairs.</p><p>The fierce battle is happening nearby.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. This place is connected to the stairwell down to the hall.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka confirms what&#39;s down the hallway.</p><p>The hallway splits at a T-junction, both branches leading to a terrace at either side of the hall.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s part here. I&#39;ll go from this side, so you go from that side.&quot;</p><hr><p>It&#39;s better to split up.</p><p>...As we are now, we have no way to escape once we&#39;re found.</p><p>There&#39;s no point in staying together right now.</p><p>We don&#39;t stand a chance either way.</p><p>If we&#39;re separated, there&#39;s hope for the other one to escape even if one of us is found.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka walks down the hallway facing east.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I nod and go down the other hallway―――the one heading west.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Shirou.&quot;</p><p>She suddenly calls to me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You know, right? Don&#39;t do anything, no matter what happens. We have no way to fight right now.</p><p>Run away if you think it&#39;s dangerous. Run away even if one of us gets caught. ...Saving others comes after you save yourself.&quot;</p><hr><p>She suppresses her emotions.</p><p>It sounds more like a wish than a warning.</p><hr><p>I go around and come out into the terrace.</p><p>I see Tohsaka emerge on the opposite side.</p><hr><p>She immediately takes cover, then peeks out.</p><p>As soon as I follow her example and look down, we both gasp.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Shinji――――!?

But we put the sand in the same coffin as the girl.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. Do you have any ideas on what to do now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I&#39;m still thinking. The situation just got worse. I can&#39;t think unless I get this sorted out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. ...The strongest enemy, Illyasviel and Berserker, are gone, but an unknown foe came out in their place.</p><p>There should only be seven Servants, but he makes eight, right? ...He&#39;s not a Servant that should exist. How did Shinji make a contract with such a guy?&quot;</p><hr><p>...An eighth Servant, huh?</p><p>I don&#39;t think we can treat that man as a Servant.</p><p>He is a heroic spirit that dominates all others.</p><p>He has a seemingly infinite supply of Noble Phantasms, and he is a devil without any human emotion.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Gilgamesh. That&#39;s the hero appearing in a myth of ancient Mesopotamia, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. He&#39;s half-human, half-god. He is the king of Uruk, and the seeker of immortality. He is said to be the tyrant that obtained everything in this world, but I didn&#39;t think he was that crazy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...He defeated Berserker so easily, so he might be stronger than Saber even if she has her true powers released.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka doesn&#39;t sound as sharp.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s because there&#39;s a new enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong? You sound like you want to say something.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... well. He was certainly strong. He has so many Noble Phantasms, so he&#39;s powerful, right?</p><p>But I&#39;m wondering how it really is. I felt that there wasn&#39;t much difference between him and Berserker.&quot;</p><hr><p>She ponders.</p><p>...Huh?</p><p>Could it be that Tohsaka doesn&#39;t know about his powers?</p><hr><p>&quot;No, he himself is about as strong as Saber or Berserker, if not weaker.</p><p>First of all, heroic spirits are as strong as their fame in the place they&#39;re summoned, right? There aren&#39;t many people here that know about Gilgamesh.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――That&#39;s true, but the change in power from popularity isn&#39;t that big.</p><p>It seemed to me like that goldie had an unfair advantage...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka calls him by a strange name.</p><p>Well, with that aside.</p><hr><p>&quot;He did. All the Noble Phantasms he has are real. ...No, they are all originals of the real ones.</p><p>Gilgamesh is a hero in the oldest myth, and he was a king that indulged in every possible luxury. Then it shouldn&#39;t be strange for him to own all the originals of the legendary weapons.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh―――then what? The Noble Phantasms he used weren&#39;t Noble Phantasms, but just weapons...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;d assume so. I bet his Noble Phantasm is his &#39;treasury&#39;.</p><p>I think his Noble Phantasm is the &#39;treasury&#39; where he kept all the weapons he collected during his life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then it&#39;s natural that Berserker couldn&#39;t beat him. Every heroic spirit has a weak point. If he has the originals of every Noble Phantasm, he just needs to take out the one that is the most effective against his enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>If there is a chance of victory, it is that he is not a master of these weapons.</p><p>He is not a &quot;wielder&quot; that has mastered his weapon to the limit, so I think there is still a way to beat him.</p><p>But with all that aside...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Tohsaka. This has nothing to do with this, but why did you call him goldie?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...!? Um, I guess... um, he had golden hair.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you saying? You should have called Saber that if that&#39;s the case. It seemed like you said it with a lot of meaning behind it. I think you noticed something, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh――――?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t hide it now. You noticed something, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-You&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s nothing serious like you&#39;re thinking, so don&#39;t worry too much about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t lie. You wouldn&#39;t call him goldie for nothing. Come on, Tohsaka. I want as much information as possible right now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh――――Uh.&quot;</p><p>I stare at Tohsaka.</p><p>After a few seconds...</p><p>She sighs as if she&#39;s given up.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well... he had many valuable looking things, right? So I just thought he&#39;s really rich.</p><p>...That&#39;s why I called him goldie. He looks like he&#39;s living a luxurious life, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka scratches her cheek while looking away.</p><p>How scary.</p><p>It seems anyone who&#39;s rich is called goldie by Tohsaka.</p><p>What&#39;s more scary is that Tohsaka figured out the Servant&#39;s true nature just because he &quot;seemed rich&quot;.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Anyways, that&#39;s another troublesome guy. There&#39;s not supposed to be an eighth Servant, so he would be the Joker.</p><p>...I want to question Kirei as the supervisor, but I don&#39;t know his whereabouts.</p><p>Well, we have to postpone that since Caster is more important right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>Caster is obtaining more power as we speak.</p><p>Saber should not be able to oppose Caster&#39;s control much longer.</p><p>No.</p><p>In the worst case, Saber could already be under her control.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Yeah.</p><p>We couldn&#39;t get Illyasviel&#39;s help, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can let them be. We&#39;ll just have to think of a way to beat Caster with the two of us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. We don&#39;t have any ideas, but we&#39;ll have to.&quot;</p><hr><p>She sighs and sits on the rubble.</p><p>&quot;...Phew. I never thought we&#39;d have a strategic meeting in a castle.&quot;</p><p>I follow Tohsaka&#39;s lead and sit down.</p><hr><p>...Well, we&#39;ll have a bed to sleep in here.</p><p>If we&#39;re lucky, we might even find some magical item of Illyasviel&#39;s.</p><hr><p>And the moment we let our guard down...</p><p>&quot;Get real. You&#39;re going to defeat them just by yourselves?</p><p>That&#39;s impossible, you idiots.&quot;</p><p>A stunned voice comes from the front entrance.</p><hr><p>&quot;!?&quot;</p><p>We jump up and turn to face the speaker.</p><hr><p>&quot;Since that night, huh? It&#39;s great you two are still hanging in there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;L―――Lancer...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>I quickly concentrate and connect my Magic Circuit.</p><p>He is certainly Lancer.</p><p>...He speared my heart on that night ten days ago.</p><p>I can&#39;t let it happen again.</p><p>I have to let Tohsaka escape before he attacks―――!</p><hr><p>&quot;Get away, Shirou...! I&#39;ll keep him busy, so you run to the second floor...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Run, Tohsaka...! I&#39;ll hold him back, so you run outside――――!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Hold on.</p><p>It seems you weren&#39;t listening to me at all when I told you to value your life.&quot;</p><p>She lowers the hand she pointed at Lancer and points at me.</p><p>But I have objections as well!</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid. I told you I won&#39;t heed your warning. It&#39;s a guy&#39;s role to fight hand-to-hand. This is the second time I&#39;m fighting him, and I&#39;m more suited for it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That can&#39;t be true! He&#39;s a foot soldier. How can I, the ranged attacker, run away from an enemy with no ranged weapons!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why! Can&#39;t you tell you&#39;ll die if he closes in on you!? You can just back me up from a distance!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You idiot! I can&#39;t back you up! I don&#39;t know any magecraft that&#39;s that precise! I bet I&#39;ll blow you away along with him!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――! Don&#39;t come out with your destructive personality!</p><p>First of all, why do you always try to be flashy!? Try doing something modest for a change! I can understand Caster not wanting you now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-What――――!?&quot;</p><hr><p>...And we argue for a few minutes.</p><p>When we begin to tire and wonder how this got started...</p><p>I notice that Lancer is watching us with a smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Oh, you&#39;re done? I&#39;m in no hurry, so finish it off. It&#39;s good to let out everything you have.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I cough and glare back at Lancer.</p><p>I take half a step forward, and Tohsaka is right behind me.</p><p>...Man, we should have done so from the start.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, hold on. I&#39;m sorry to say this after you&#39;ve reached a compromise, but I don&#39;t intend to fight. I was just unable to ignore you guys. I&#39;m butting in so that I can help you guys a bit.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh――――at?&quot;</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>What did he just say――――!?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Did I mishear you? I think I heard that you&#39;re helping us.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, is it hard to understand my point? I guess I&#39;ll rephrase it. You two are no match for Caster. So I will lend you guys a hand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m stunned.</p><p>But Tohsaka quickly grasps the situation.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. You really are butting in. Is that really your idea?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s an order from my Master. He wants to cooperate against Caster since he&#39;s alone. Well, we&#39;re just making a quick alliance until we defeat Caster.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s a sound reason. But I think there&#39;s a more reliable guy to go talk to.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Is she talking about Shinji and Gilgamesh?</p><p>It seems Tohsaka is trying to figure out if Lancer knows about them――――</p><hr><p>&quot;No, they won&#39;t do. I don&#39;t want to ally with them.</p><p>I have no complaints about his power, but it&#39;s too troublesome to worry about my back when I&#39;m fighting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Oh. That&#39;s the correct choice, Lancer. Is that an order from your Master as well?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s wrong as well. I chose you two out of personal interest. You guys are easier to talk to since we&#39;re acquaintances, right?&quot;</p><p>He speaks plainly.</p><p>It seems that fighting Archer and driving his lance through my heart are the same as becoming acquaintances in his mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on, Lancer. I was almost killed twice by you. And you think I&#39;m going to believe you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do believe so. Your commander-in-chief is a good frank woman. Such a good woman is helping you out, so you must be good-natured as well, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm</p><p>&quot;</p><p>I frown.</p><p>...I&#39;m troubled that Tohsaka is nodding at our enemy&#39;s words.</p><hr><p>&quot;So that&#39;s it. That&#39;s why I thought we might be able to cooperate.</p><p>―――Oh, but let me tell you. It&#39;s not &#39;you guys&#39;. &#39;I&#39;m&#39; the one who thought that you guys would make good allies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t understand the difference.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Aren&#39;t you the cocky one? You brought on the proposal, but you&#39;re the one that&#39;s going to choose?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ve liked you since the first time I saw you.</p><p>You&#39;re beautiful, stubborn, and courageous. If I&#39;m to have a female Master, I want someone like you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer looks at Tohsaka with cool eyes.</p><p>&quot;...Humph.&quot;</p><p>...I don&#39;t like him for some reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Fine. I&#39;m up for it. But it&#39;s not decided yet.</p><p>If Emiya-kun can&#39;t trust you, we have to break off negotiations.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, that&#39;s what she&#39;s saying.

Oh, as expected from a house with a dojo.</p><p>It&#39;s rare to see a first aid kit with needles and threads along with scissors... Hey, come on. Take off your shirt and show me your wound.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh―――I have to take my clothes off? Oh, no, I can do it myself. I treated myself this morning, so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Come on.

But that was, um...&quot;</p><p>I was unconscious and I was only causing trouble for Tohsaka at that time.</p><hr><p>&quot;Stop your whining and hurry up.

To be honest, it&#39;s burning right now.&quot;</p><p>I give up and sit down.</p><p>Seeing that the shirt is stained with blood, Tohsaka gives up taking it off and starts cutting it right away.

It&#39;s fine now, right? Just use styptic and roll up the bandage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s not called treating. ...I take it back. I&#39;m angry.

Do you have some grudge against me!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Humph. You have no idea. You should thank me for going easy on you.&quot;</p><p>Saying so, Tohsaka takes out something that looks like ointment.</p><hr><p>&quot;That hurts, right? I healed the dead nerves, so it should hurt for a while. There&#39;s painkiller in this ointment, but it&#39;s mainly to replace your flesh.</p><p>It&#39;ll hurt until it familiarizes with your body, so don&#39;t do anything reckless until the pain goes away.&quot;</p><hr><p>She takes the jelly-like substance and applies it to my wound.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>It looks really suspicious, but I stay quiet since I know Tohsaka is seriously treating my wound.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s it. You should feel much better tomorrow if you wrap some bandages around it and get a good night&#39;s sleep.&quot;</p><hr><p>She skillfully wraps the bandages around the wound.</p><p>...I&#39;m not praising her or anything, but she does a much better job than I do.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. Um, thanks, Tohsaka. I feel much better.&quot;</p><p>I thank her while averting my gaze.</p><p>&quot;Eh―――w-well, that&#39;s good. I&#39;m glad I treated you if you say so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s even more helpful because I thought it wouldn&#39;t heal up.</p><p>Thanks for treating the wound.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――H-Heh. That&#39;s only natural. It&#39;ll heal as long as I treat it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Finishing the treatment, Tohsaka gets up.</p><p>...Then.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but she heads to the kitchen.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>Am I seeing things?</p><p>She&#39;s checking what&#39;s inside the refrigerator and the rice cooker.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m preparing dinner.

There is no meaning in such a thing.&quot;</p><p>Saying so, she closes her eyes.</p><p>She empties her mind.</p><p>For now――――she lets her guard down and rests her mind.</p><hr><p>...She hears the sound of rain.</p><p>It was a night without moonlight.</p><p>The surroundings were pitch black, and she wandered with an empty mind.</p><p>That is where she met him.</p><p>With bloodstained body and frozen limbs.</p><p>A chanced meeting that was more miraculous than any miracle.</p><hr><p>It was the mountain where the Ryuudou Temple is located.</p><p>Falling rain.</p><p>She was stumbling aimlessly through the dense forest.</p><p>&quot;Haa――――Haa, ha――――&quot;</p><p>She left behind a trail of blood.</p><p>In her hand was a dagger that breaks all contracts.</p><p>Her purple robe was wet with rain, and her limbs had turned white from the winter cold.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha――――Haa, ha――――......!&quot;</p><p>She staggered around, holding on to the trees for support.</p><p>She walked on, dirtied with mud, her breath ragged, reaching out her hand as if begging for help.</p><p>She did not look like her usual self, filled with cool composure.</p><p>No, even the amount of magical energy was unlike her.</p><p>―――She was exhausted.</p><p>She only had a handful of power left.</p><hr><p>For a Servant, magical energy is like a lifeline that allows them to stay in this world.</p><p>But that was all lost. No magical energy was coming from her Master.</p><p>But that was only natural.</p><p>She had just killed her own Master.</p><p>That was the cause of her exhaustion.</p><p>She―――Servant Caster was about to disappear alone as compensation for obtaining freedom.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa――――aha, hahaha――――&quot;</p><p>A dry laugh.</p><p>It is funny that her body was not able to maintain itself and that she betrayed her vulgar Master.</p><p>Moreover, it&#39;s quite amusing to see how badly she had underestimated the relationship between Servant and Master.</p><hr><p>――――She had done well.</p><p>Her Master was a legitimate magus.</p><p>He was in his thirties, had a medium build, and had few noteworthy characteristics.</p><p>He had no will to fight, but dreamed of victory. He was a man that only waited for the other Masters to kill each other.</p><hr><p>The man had not trusted Caster.</p><p>He treated Caster coldly as she was a superior magus, and he insulted her for being inferior to other Servants.</p><hr><p>She gave up on him after a few days.</p><p>She acted as an obedient Servant and filled the man&#39;s conceit.</p><p>In short, she made him use his Command Spells for meaningless things.</p><p>She told him he did not need the Command Spells.</p><p>She made him believe that she would be faithful to her Master even without the Command Spell.</p><hr><p>It was his fault for believing in her.</p><p>The Master used his third Command Spell for a meaningless thing, and was killed by Caster at that moment.</p><p>It was easy.</p><p>She did not like the fact that the contract with him still existed, so she killed him using the Rule Breaker.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Kuh, ah――――&quot;</p><p>But she had made a mistake.</p><p>Servants exist using the supply of magical energy provided by their Masters.</p><p>But not just magical energy.</p><p>Servants are only allowed to exist in this age by being connected with people of this age.</p><p>In other words―――to lose one&#39;s Master, the passport to this age, means being forced to return to the &quot;outside&quot; world.</p><hr><p>...But she would not normally be this exhausted.</p><p>This was the curse her Master had left her.</p><p>Her Master did not approve of her, as she was a better magus than he was.</p><p>Therefore, he limited her magical energy to be always below his level.</p><hr><p>The magical energy level of a mere human cannot keep a Servant in this world.</p><p>She would normally be able to stay in this world for two days after losing her Master.</p><hr><p>But now was different.</p><p>Her magical energy was drastically decreasing with every second, and the end was near.</p><p>...Probably a few more minutes.</p><p>She would disappear if she could not find her next Master in that time.</p><p>She would disappear before she could fight, unable to do anything. She would be a pitiful Servant, summoned only to be trampled upon.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah――――haa, ha――――&quot;</p><p>It was vexing.</p><p>It was vexing, but it wasn&#39;t anything out of the ordinary.</p><p>It had always been like this for her.</p><p>She was treated unreasonably like this all the time.</p><p>She was always used as a tool, and she was never understood by anyone.</p><hr><p>――――Yes.</p><p>Her life was always controlled by someone else.</p><p>Her mind was destroyed at a young age to save a hero chosen by the gods.</p><p>Just for the sake of a hero the goddess of beauty happened to favor, the goddess cursed her to blindly love a man she had never seen.</p><p>The girl betrayed her father, and she was even forced to betray her own country.</p><hr><p>...There is no memory after that.</p><p>After everything was over, the girl, who was a princess, was in an unfamiliar country.</p><p>A girl that betrayed her father, the king, for a man.</p><p>A witch that cut apart her own brother and threw the pieces into the sea to escape her native country.</p><p>―――And the man who wanted it done cast her aside in order to become king, saying he could not marry a witch.</p><hr><p>She was controlled and taken to an unknown country, was marked as a witch, and the only person she could rely on threw her away.</p><p>That is her origin.</p><p>There is nothing people can blame her for, and people around her were aware of that.</p><p>But still, people continued to demand for her to be a witch.</p><hr><p>An evil to protect the king.</p><p>An evil to be on the receiving end of evil superstitions.</p><p>People wanted a convenient scapegoat that they could blame for any disaster.</p><p>This pattern has never changed.</p><p>People demand easily understandable evil to reassure themselves of their own goodness.</p><hr><p>In that regard, she was the perfect sacrifice.</p><p>The father she could rely on was in a distant country.</p><p>Nobody defended her, and people gladly blamed her for all the ugly things in their world.</p><p>They decided that every ugliness was the witch&#39;s doing:</p><p>that they are poor,</p><p>that they hate others,</p><p>that humans are ugly,</p><p>and even that people die.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha――――Haha, ah, ha――――&quot;</p><p>...So she merely accepted it.</p><p>Since she could only live as a witch, she decided to live like a witch.</p><p>She swore to show them the ugliness of the wishes they demanded of her.</p><hr><p>If people do not know their ugliness, so be it.</p><p>They can stay ignorant, go to hell for their own crimes, and suffer forever.</p><p>They won&#39;t be able to get out of hell.</p><p>They will suffer forever as criminals because they do not know what crimes they have committed.</p><p>That is the reason for existence she imposed on herself.</p><p>That is the only role people gave to the girl, to the one called the witch, who never had a free will.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah――――Ah――――&quot;</p><p>But...</p><p>Nobody actually wished for such a thing.</p><p>The same goes for her as well.</p><p>She seeks revenge against her will, without having any wish for herself.</p><p>―――Yes.</p><p>Until she met up with this stranger.</p><hr><p>A rustling sound.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>She peered ahead, even though she was barely able to stand.</p><p>It&#39;s midnight.</p><p>Who could possibly come into this forest at this time?</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you doing there?&quot;</p><p>It was a heavy voice.</p><p>She did not have the composure to check who it was.</p><p>She just thought it was all over.</p><p>She had no power to use magecraft.</p><p>Her purple robe might have looked like a coat, but she was covered in blood.</p><hr><p>A woman covered in blood was hiding in the rain.</p><p>It is obvious what such a person did.</p><p>Anyone would run away first.</p><p>What would they do after that? They would either call the police or pretend they hadn&#39;t seen it.</p><p>...It did not matter to her, as she could no longer move.</p><hr><p>That caused the last of her spirit to give out.</p><p>Her last moment was cold and lonely, just as it was at the end of her true lifetime.</p><p>―――Or so she thought.</p><hr><p>When she regained consciousness, she was in that place.</p><p>In front of her is that man――――the man who she met in the woods.</p><hr><p>&quot;So you&#39;ve awakened. Can you tell me your circumstances?&quot;</p><p>Those were his first words.</p><p>When she watched the man with blank amazement...</p><p>&quot;Go home if I did a needless thing. If you wish for me to forget about this, I shall do so.&quot;</p><p>...The tone of his voice never changed.</p><hr><p>...That was her first encounter with her Master, Kuzuki Souichirou.</p><p>Kuzuki was a strange man.</p><p>Should he be called a ghost?</p><p>He had no reason to live, but had no reason to die.</p><p>He was just there, and since he existed, he followed whatever whim took him.</p><hr><p>He has no self.</p><p>That was her first impression of him, and she thought it would be easy to turn him into a puppet.</p><p>―――She grew to realize that the thought was a mistake.</p><p>Kuzuki Souichirou does not have a past.</p><p>He has no self because he has no past, but it does not mean Kuzuki Souichirou is empty.</p><hr><p>Kuzuki was a sincere man.</p><p>He easily accepted her when she told him that she wanted him to be her Master and when she told him about her true identity.</p><hr><p>When she asked him, &quot;Do you believe such a story?&quot;</p><p>He replied, &quot;Was that a lie?&quot;</p><p>He accepted it after she told him it was the truth.</p><hr><p>And the most amazing part was the night they met.</p><p>As she was about to disappear, she told Kuzuki to lay with her.</p><p>After making a difficult expression...</p><p>&quot;Let me ask. Do you want it rough or gentle?&quot;</p><p>After that, he made love to her without waiting for her reply.</p><hr><p>To put it his way, they had sex before the Buddha.</p><p>It seemed rough like Asura, but it also seemed gentle like Bodhisattva.</p><p>...Either way, the contract was completed.</p><p>She obtained a new Master, was able to stay in this world, and returned to her role of being a witch.</p><hr><p>...She still considers it to be a miracle.</p><p>She would have disappeared before she woke up if she wasn&#39;t taken to the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>The Ryuudou Temple is a demonic place for Servants, but it is a perfect summoning place once inside.</p><p>As the Ryuudou Temple is surrounded by a boundary field, it is suited for keeping anything inhuman.</p><hr><p>She was able to remain without disappearing because she was brought to the Ryuudou Temple. Had it been anyplace else, she would have vanished after being taken there.</p><p>As a result, she obtained the best ley line and the best protection.</p><p>She easily occupied the Ryuudou Temple, figured out the mechanism of the Holy Grail, and summoned Assassin as the fifth Servant.</p><hr><p>But such things are trivial matters.</p><p>She was certainly lucky on that night.</p><p>Many miracles saved her, and she is now on the verge of victory.</p><p>But they do not deserve thanks. She would have been fine with it even if those miracles had not occurred.</p><hr><p>―――There is only one important fact.</p><p>A very small matter that is trivial for anyone else.</p><p>For her, the fact that she was able to meet Kuzuki Souichirou is a miracle beyond belief.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But it&#39;s not going well.</p><p>No, she feels that everything she does is not going well.</p><hr><p>Her Master will not be delighted with what she did.</p><p>He has never had an interest in the Holy Grail.</p><p>She would do her best to grant any wish of his, but Kuzuki Souichirou has none.</p><hr><p>A one-sided relationship.</p><p>They do not get along well.</p><p>It is not going well at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――So the mummy hunter became the mummy? Even the rare witch is fragile, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>She turns to the intruder.</p><p>It is not her Master that is standing there.</p><p>It is the knight in red, Archer, with his true identity still unknown.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Archer. I thought I ordered you to keep watch outside.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but I didn&#39;t see any enemies around here. I got bored, so I came to check what was going on in here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh, I would assume so. The only enemy we have is Berserker. Even with him, we will go attack them ourselves once Saber is fully controlled. We have had nothing to fear since you joined us.</p><p>―――Isn&#39;t that why you came to my side?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who knows. Don&#39;t you think I only wanted to break my contract with that Master? Don&#39;t you think I didn&#39;t care who my new Master was?&quot;</p><p>There is some truth in Archer&#39;s words.</p><p>...But what does it mean?</p><p>Archer had no intention of betraying, but betrayed his Master only because he wanted to break his contract with Tohsaka Rin?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So you did not like looking after that little girl? Well, it is true that Servants are dissatisfied with their Masters. It is natural for you to run out of patience with yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, she was perfect as a summoner. But some miscalculations occurred.</p><p>And Caster, let me warn you. Do not consider all Servants to be like you.</p><p>At the very least, Saber and Berserker were satisfied with their Masters. A righteous hero can only be summoned by righteous people.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh, why tell me that now? A twisted Master calls for twisted heroic spirits. You do not need to tell me that.&quot;</p><p>...That is right. Servants are determined by their summoners.</p><p>Summoners with dark shadows in their mind cannot summon heroic spirits who are on the light side.</p><hr><p>In that regard, she and Rider are not heroic spirits.</p><p>A twisted Master calls for twisted heroic spirits.</p><p>As Rider was &quot;one that was beautiful&quot;, she was also &quot;one that was pure&quot;.</p><p>It is ironic how the Servant Caster summoned is a fictional hero.</p><hr><p>&quot;But it is indeed strange once I think about it. You and Rider are ones that oppose the heroic spirits. But you two are still summoned as Servants.</p><p>...Well, the Holy Grail does not differentiate between good and evil. So I guess it will summon anyone with powers, huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Originally, a mixed spirit that had a heroic side would not have been called upon.</p><p>Things went out of order starting with the third war. Heroic spirits like Rider and I were not summoned before that.&quot;</p><hr><p>...That does not concern her now.</p><p>She is not concerned about the true identity of the Holy Grail.</p><p>Servant Caster&#39;s mission is to win this war.</p><p>She is not interested in what comes after.</p><p>No, to be honest, that is not the end she wishes for.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Enough with the meaningless talk.</p><p>Get back to your station. I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re thinking. You are my Servant now. Your life is in my hands. Put that into consideration when you talk to me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Understood. Then I shall live up to my Master&#39;s expectation like an obedient Servant.&quot;</p><p>The knight in red goes up the stairs.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Seeing him off silently, Caster lets out a long sigh.</p><hr><p>―――One more day until Saber surrenders.</p><p>She does not have the Holy Grail yet, but she will approach the end once Saber falls.</p><p>...What will happen when the war ends?</p><p>Caster will make every wish come true with her powers.</p><p>It is not bad to live as a witch, like she swore before dying.</p><hr><p>But―――the reason will go away once the war ends.</p><p>Even if she still has the will, her master will lose the reason to stay as her Master.</p><p>&quot;―――――I will obtain the Holy Grail soon.&quot;</p><p>Caster gracefully reaches out into empty space.</p><p>Her hard work is about to be rewarded, but her expression is like that of a criminal about to be executed.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-14" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 14</h2><p>―――I saw many corpses.</p><p>I died at that time and was reborn.</p><hr><p>I do not have any regrets.</p><p>My eyes lost hatred there.</p><p>My hands lost anger there.</p><p>My legs lost hope there.</p><p>My self lost its self there.</p><hr><p>Everything went away.</p><p>It is not because I gave up that I believed nothing would save me.</p><p>I just found out that it&#39;s natural.</p><p>It&#39;s just that dying people will die and survivors will survive.</p><p>I laid down on the rubble and stared at the burning field.</p><p>I understood everything then.</p><p>I thought I understood everything.</p><hr><p>――――But I still considered it...</p><p>How wonderful it would be...</p><p>If I was able to save everything here.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s what I admired.</p><p>I just wished nobody would have to suffer.</p><p>That&#39;s why I tried to become a superhero.</p><p>It was simple, and it seemed like an ideal existence.</p><hr><p>That was why I aimed for it.</p><p>I knew where I had to be, but there were many ways to get there.</p><p>I kept on running, wanting to get as close to it as possible, even though I did not know what was right or wrong.</p><hr><p>Many paths I took were crooked, and my destination was only getting farther away.</p><p>I&#39;m taking the long way.</p><p>I&#39;ve been repeating this for ten years since I got saved by Kiritsugu.</p><hr><p>But I won&#39;t regret it.</p><p>I&#39;m not as skillful as Tohsaka.</p><p>I will take the wrong path and lose a lot of things at times.</p><p>But I cannot discard them as meaningless.</p><p>I have to present meanings for everything I&#39;ve trampled upon and everything that cannot be returned.</p><hr><p>So I cannot lose.</p><p>It can&#39;t be helped if I lose against someone else.</p><p>But I can win against myself.

It looks so wrong, and yet so right.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. We&#39;re heading to the forest on the outskirts of this town.</p><p>It&#39;s a huge woodland, unkempt and far from the city.</p><p>It has rejected human interaction for a long time, so the forest is big and wide.

I felt a shock...!&quot;</p><p>I pull back my foot.</p><p>I only felt the shock for an instant.</p><p>It&#39;s not that strong, so it&#39;d hurt more if I hit my foot on the corner of a dresser.</p><p>...Well, in short, it was like static electricity.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I thought so.

You know you will not be able to kill me, so you went after the Master instead. You brought on the negotiation because you know I would not stop even if you killed my Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right. You wouldn&#39;t stop even if I killed Shinji. But you can consider it in this situation, right?</p><p>You can save Shinji right now. If you&#39;re a Servant, it should be a hard blow for you to lose your Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah.

With that aside, how about it, Tohsaka? Do you want to forget about Emiya and team up with us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――&#39;Us&#39;?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. You should know that Caster is stocking up power. The Ryuudou Temple is the altar this time. It&#39;s a bit unfavorable for us if she&#39;s taking position there and stocking up magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji says this with both his hands raised.</p><p>That&#39;s an obvious fact.</p><p>If I have to add, it seems Shinji doesn&#39;t know Caster obtained Saber and Archer.</p><hr><p>&quot;You can tell, right? There&#39;s not much chance of victory by myself.</p><p>I beat Berserker&#39;s Master, but this isn&#39;t enough. We can make one that will even beat Caster if you join us.&quot;</p><p>Shinji invites her with confidence.</p><p>To that...</p><hr><p>&quot;I refuse, Shinji. I don&#39;t know who you&#39;re connected with, but there&#39;s no way I would follow a guy that is being used.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka refuses him without twitching a brow.</p><hr><p>&quot;W――――What...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can&#39;t you tell?

I don&#39;t know what happened to you ten years ago, but that must be why you&#39;re so screwed up...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka looks like she&#39;s crying.</p><p>Why does she have to make a face like that?</p><p>It&#39;s as if...</p><p>...She knows I&#39;ll live a thankless life, so she&#39;s trying to stop me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You were like this at school. You were so calm in front of all those bodies. ...Even I mistook them for corpses, but you knew right away that they were alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I always thought that it was strange.</p><p>You never had proper training as a magus, but you got calm every time you got into a fight to the death.</p><p>You would get enraged by seeing corpses, but you didn&#39;t feel any shock or disgust.</p><p>It&#39;s probably because―――corpses are something you got used to seeing. You saw something gruesome ten years ago, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I got used to seeing them...?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s true that it wasn&#39;t my first time seeing a corpse.</p><p>The students at school, Rider who got her neck twisted off, and even this girl sleeping in front of me now... I think they&#39;ve died a natural death compared to that time.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But she&#39;s wrong.</p><p>The fire ten years ago saved Emiya Shirou.</p><p>That cannot be the main reason why Tohsaka is criticising me now.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s wrong, Tohsaka. I was saved, that&#39;s all.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;&#39;Saved&#39;...? So you were saved from the fire ten years ago? And that was by Emiya Kiritsugu?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. But that&#39;s it. That isn&#39;t the reason for anything.&quot;</p><p>My heart aches when I answer.</p><p>My body is telling me that it&#39;s a lie.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then was there something else? Something you&#39;re always regretting or something Emiya Kiritsugu took from you as compensation for saving you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――There&#39;s no such thing. Kiritsugu merely saved me. And you talk about taking something from me, but at that time...&quot;</p><p>...I had nothing to give.</p><hr><p>―――I saw many corpses.</p><p>I died at that time and was reborn.</p><hr><p>――――I do not have any regrets.</p><p>My eyes lost hatred there.</p><p>My hands lost anger there.</p><p>My legs lost hope there.</p><p>My self lost its self there.</p><p>...So why?</p><p>Why do I have this self-consciousness that Tohsaka speaks of?</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――, That&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>I have accepted death.</p><p>I knew I was going to die.</p><p>Even if my body was saved in that situation, there&#39;s no way my mind could have been saved as well.</p><hr><p>At that time...</p><p>I was empty, and I just admired something sacred...</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh――――that&#39;s... right.&quot;</p><p>I remember now.</p><p>No, I didn&#39;t even put it into my memory.</p><p>So I didn&#39;t realize until now that it&#39;s what really saved me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou? Did he make you establish a contract or something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. He didn&#39;t take anything away. I only received.&quot;</p><hr><p>A world like hell.</p><p>In the place where everyone but me died, I was saved.</p><p>Nobody saved me, and I wasn&#39;t able to save anybody.</p><p>And at the very end, he granted something that I thought was a miracle.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I remember. Those eyes that looked down at me and the voice pleading for me to live.</p><p>At that time, I thought not about the fact that I was saved, but the fact that someone&#39;s there to save me... The fact itself is...&quot;</p><hr><p>It&#39;s so wonderful, and it&#39;s such a miraculous thing.</p><p>That&#39;s why I admired it.</p><p>I had nothing, and there was nothing remaining in me, I admired the first thing that came into my sight.</p><hr><p>&quot;So I――――&quot;</p><hr><p>―――That&#39;s the only thing I had.</p><p>That&#39;s the only emotion I felt after I was saved.</p><p>I was happy.</p><p>I cried.</p><p>That&#39;s all I could think about.</p><p>So――that&#39;s all the emotion I could create――</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Yeah. You&#39;re probably right.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s distorted for me to put priority on others before me.</p><p>There is something seriously wrong with the procedure.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I was the only one who got saved. I thought about it at that time.</p><p>―――That if such a thing happened again, I would save everyone in place of all those I could not save then.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m telling you that&#39;s crazy...!</p><p>Look, if you were saved, take care of yourself! I&#39;m sorry for the people who got killed, but it&#39;s only by chance that you were saved!</p><p>Then you should take full advantage of your good fortune. You suffered such a hell, so it&#39;ll be a waste if you don&#39;t have fun!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is seriously angry.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Yeah, that makes me happy.</p><p>I finally realize now, because Tohsaka is that kind of person.</p><hr><p>The question I&#39;ve been wondering about all by myself.</p><p>I wanted to be a superhero, and I always tried to help others.</p><p>I knew there was something wrong with the method, but I did not understand what.</p><hr><p>―――But it&#39;s so clear now.</p><p>It&#39;s because of this person that is seriously angry for my sake.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What? You still don&#39;t understand after I&#39;ve told you this much?</p><p>You really make me mad. If you&#39;re really that stupid, I&#39;ll break my allian――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. I told you you&#39;re right, didn&#39;t I?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I can&#39;t listen to your warning.</p><p>I realize there&#39;s something wrong with me. But it&#39;s all right.</p><p>Because there&#39;s no way that wanting to help people can be a mistake.&quot;</p><hr><p>So...</p><p>I answer her with as much gratitude as I can possibly put in.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――!</p><p>...Geez, I can&#39;t say anything if you make a face like that.&quot;</p><p>Maybe it got awkward, as Tohsaka turns and walks away.</p><hr><p>And then...</p><p>&quot;―――Well, I guess it can&#39;t be helped. I guess I&#39;ll do something about it.&quot;</p><p>She sighs as she says this.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-19" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 19</h2><p>The sun sets and the hall is filled with darkness.</p><p>...We came here to look for an ally, but the only thing remaining here after turns of events is this empty castle.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what will we do? We can stay here if we want to go into defense.</p><p>There&#39;s food and beds here. If we fix the walls, we can probably manage to protect ourselves inside the castle.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s the best thing we can do if we want to protect ourselves.</p><p>But we chose the path to &quot;fight&quot; because we couldn&#39;t do so.</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, it&#39;s meaningless even if we fortify.</p><p>Any defense will be penetrated once Caster completely controls Saber.</p><p>...And even if we do survive here, it doesn&#39;t matter if Caster obtains the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Not only us, but the people in town will suffer as well.</p><p>...Then there&#39;s only one thing to do. We&#39;ll get Saber back before Caster controls her. We have to defeat Caster, Archer, Assassin, and Kuzuki-Sensei by ourselves.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I silently nod.</p><p>Since we could not get Illya&#39;s help, that&#39;s all we can do.</p><p>...The sun will completely set soon.</p><p>We&#39;ll have to get out of this place before that and attack Caster before Saber is completely controlled――――</p><hr><p>―――It&#39;s a simple plan.</p><p>The process will change depending on the situation. Our only objective is to confront Caster as a result.</p><hr><p>It doesn&#39;t even matter if that only happens for an instant.</p><p>Caster is the weakest when it comes to hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>Even if she may be a Servant, there is a chance of victory if we can fight her two against one.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s jewels and my projection magecraft.</p><p>We can win if we use all of our abilities.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s the result we came up with, and we go out of the forest believing in it.</p><p>We don&#39;t talk after that.</p><p>...There&#39;s only one reason not to.</p><p>We&#39;re desperately bluffing to try to deceive ourselves.</p><hr><p>The morning light is gray.</p><p>The sun is blocked by clouds, obscuring the dawn.</p><p>A cloudy sky is above us.</p><p>The sky is more gray than black, and it reminds me of that time ten years ago.</p><hr><p>―――It should rain soon.</p><p>An impure gray sky.</p><p>The man is standing below the cloudy sky.</p><hr><p>&quot;So you did come. I know your personality. I knew you would be back with some sort of a plan.&quot;</p><p>He stares at her with cool eyes.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Archer. I can&#39;t live up to your expectations.</p><p>We have nothing to start out with. We thought for a day, but we couldn&#39;t come up with anything.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You might not believe me, but we&#39;re here today to die honorably.</p><p>...But I guess we&#39;re still a bit lucky. If you&#39;re here, it means Saber is still opposing Caster.&quot;</p><hr><p>So there&#39;s four enemies now.</p><p>If we pass Archer, we can fight Caster and Assassin head on.</p><p>Our plan is that we would fight Archer together and confront Caster with the two of us.</p><p>...That&#39;s the lie Tohsaka made up.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I see. Caster and Emiya Shirou. The scales tipped to Caster, huh?&quot;</p><p>Archer&#39;s question is a loaded one.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I hate my own personality, but I guess I can&#39;t change it since I&#39;m born with it. I&#39;m inhuman at the very end.&quot;</p><p>Saying so with an emotionless voice, Tohsaka steps forward.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Shirou. Archer will only attack you. I won&#39;t back you up. I&#39;ll try to fight Caster while you get killed.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka apologizes with her back turned...</p><p>Confessing that she intended to use me as a sacrifice from the start.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>How stupid of her.</p><p>She didn&#39;t have to say such a thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, you idiot. I know your personality.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh――――?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re not one to do anything without a chance of victory, right? That&#39;s why I knew. This is certainly the only way we&#39;ll have any chance of winning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Her back shakes a bit.</p><p>...Oh.</p><p>That&#39;s all the apology I need.</p><hr><p>&quot;Go. I&#39;ll keep Archer busy. I&#39;ll keep him here at least until you make it into the church.&quot;</p><p>I control my breathing and turn the gears of the engine.</p><p>―――I feel great.</p><p>I should be able to project his swords in this state.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Thanks. I&#39;m sorry, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka runs.</p><p>...Archer lets her go as if he has no interest in her.</p><p>&quot;Well done. It seems you understand your own powers.&quot;</p><p>He emits an intent to kill.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Trace, on.&quot;</p><p>...I project his twin swords.</p><p>The battle should be decided in an instant.</p><p>I only see Archer and the back of Tohsaka running to the church.</p><hr><p>...Was it over in one blow, or was I able to last a few seconds?</p><p>The battle has ended, and I look up at the sky powerlessly.</p><p>A gray cloud is overhead.</p><p>It should rain soon.</p><p>The sky is near, and the clouds block my way like a wall.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Tohsaka, please... be... safe――――&quot;</p><p>My body is burning.</p><p>I hear the sound of flames from the church.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Ha, ah.&quot;</p><p>The sun is too far away for my outstretched hand.</p><p>It looks like the time from ten years ago...</p><hr><h2 id="scene-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-20" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 20</h2><p>We walk through the dark forest.</p><p>Although we don&#39;t know his intentions, having Lancer&#39;s help means we don&#39;t need to stay at the castle anymore.</p><p>Lancer must have taken a liking to Tohsaka, as he keeps messing with her and getting hit by her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. You have your own Master, right? Then you should stay quiet.</p><p>We&#39;re going to be enemies after we beat Caster, so it does no good to be talking. Anything other than planning is unnecessary.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What, we can&#39;t talk because we&#39;re going to be enemies? You have less composure than you look like you have, huh? It should be natural for you to drink until dawn with someone that gets along with you, even if he may be your enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;When are you from?</p><p>All that &#39;friends today, foes tomorrow&#39; business is out of style these days. If we don&#39;t think things all the way through, it&#39;s rude to the other party.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Wow. It sure became a boring world.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Lancer does not learn his lesson.</p><p>I think they&#39;ve been repeating the same kind of conversation for a while now.</p><hr><p>&quot;More importantly, Lancer. You know what your role is, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Yeah, leave it to me. You two are going to fight Caster and her Master, right?</p><p>My role is to fight Archer.</p><p>I&#39;ll have to fight Saber as well in the worst case, but it won&#39;t be a problem if all I have to do is keep them busy.&quot;</p><hr><p>He speaks objectively.</p><p>He isn&#39;t even scared of fighting Saber and Archer at the same time.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Oh yeah, Saber commented on him when we were training in the dojo.</p><p>She said Lancer is the best when it comes to &quot;surviving&quot;.</p><hr><p>She praised him, saying that with his excellent agility and great experience, Lancer would be an impregnable wall if he went into defense.</p><p>...He must have fought many battles from disadvantageous positions when he was alive.</p><p>This man ran through fatal battles like a panther and lived on.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s fine. But our enemy isn&#39;t just Archer and Saber. Caster also has Assassin. In the worst case, you&#39;d have to fight three.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s bad. I don&#39;t like that guy. I don&#39;t even want to fight him one-on-one if I can help it. It&#39;s best to kill such a guy from a distance―――but there&#39;s no point in worrying.</p><p>Assassin won&#39;t be at the church.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? How can you say so? If Caster won&#39;t go back to the Ryuudou Temple, wouldn&#39;t she call for her guard, Assassin?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. Assassin is a Servant that Caster summoned, but he has his limitations because of that. He is a heroic spirit summoned to that place. He can&#39;t leave the Ryuudou Temple, and in any case, Caster won&#39;t call for him.</p><p>He is a Servant that Caster summoned without letting her Master know.</p><p>She will try to hide Assassin as long as they&#39;re at the church, and I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t let go of the Ryuudou Temple either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;She won&#39;t let go of the Ryuudou Temple...? Does that mean...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s because that mountain is the summoning place of the Holy Grail. Do you know? This is the fifth Holy Grail War, but there are only four possible places for the Holy Grail to be summoned into. Two of the places are the Ryuudou Temple and the church.</p><p>By the way, it was summoned at the church in the third war. The fourth one was summoned in a plain somewhere.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Oh. I thought you didn&#39;t think at all, but you&#39;re pretty well-informed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s just that my Master is fastidious. I&#39;m not interested in your doings.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. ...But, I see. So the summoning this time has returned to the same place as the first time, huh?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka starts to ponder.</p><p>Lancer watches her with delight and walks on in the dark forest.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>The date has already changed.</p><p>The day should be dawning by the time we get out of this forest.</p><hr><p>...I mentally prepare myself as I walk.</p><p>We will fight Caster again in a few hours.</p><p>...I won&#39;t hesitate, even if that girl would have turned into our enemy by then.</p><p>We&#39;ll defeat Caster.</p><p>I have to tell myself that it is the most important thing right now.</p><hr><p>――――We head to the battlefield.</p><p>No matter what may be awaiting us at the church at daybreak, we cannot stop now.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-21" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-21" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 21</h2><p>...We walk in the forest.</p><p>We&#39;re the only people in this vast place.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t hear any beasts, and the grasses are dead like corpses.</p><p>The endless rows of trees makes me think this forest goes on forever.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s been three hours since we entered.</p><p>Just as our surroundings start to blur together...</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Found it.</p><p>...Geez, I&#39;m still stunned even though I knew about it. They really did build something like that in such a place.&quot;</p><hr><p>I follow Tohsaka&#39;s stare.</p><p>There&#39;s only darkness ahead.</p><p>Between the trees.</p><p>There is something unbefitting of these surroundings, visible through a crack so small that you&#39;d miss it if you weren&#39;t careful.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What&#39;s that? Is that a wall?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is a wall. Geez, what&#39;s up with them?

Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka is looking up at the castle with an alarmed expression.</p><p>Her face is tense as if she&#39;s confronting an enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Is there something wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. There&#39;s someone else besides us here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. This is where Illya and Berserker live.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean. There&#39;s someone else other than that. ...We&#39;re going in this way, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh――――w-wait...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka starts running towards a big tree by the wall, and I don&#39;t have time to stop her.</p><p>No, that&#39;s not all.</p><p>She grabs onto a branch and skillfully climbs up.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I look up in astonishment.</p><p>Tohsaka looks around and―――</p><p>She jumps and kicks at the castle.</p><hr><p>A shattering sound.</p><p>The window breaks and the red figure disappears into the castle.</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on...!
