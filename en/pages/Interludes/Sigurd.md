# Sigurd

Note: Translated by Smoof: [Part 1](https://redd.it/j5avbf), [Part 2](https://redd.it/j5b3uz)

## It has no mass, no shape, yet it exists. 

**Narration:**
---It burns, it burns, it’s burning.
---It burns with love, it burns with a soul, it burns with passion, and it is something that channels happiness.
---Ahh, my flame, my blaze has yet to weaken.

It refuses to freeze, it melts ice and snow….
This power within me, still rages on.

Even now.
It opens up in a forest where you set up camp.

**Fujimaru:**
Sigurd, the stew is ready.

**Sigurd:**
Well, well, I’m very grateful.
Servants don’t need to eat food, but if you’re not low on it, then I am happy to partake with pleasure.

**Mash:**
It’s alright. There’s always more. We have around more than we can eat.

**Fou:**
Fou, fou.

**Martha:**
Sorry about that. Whenever I’m the cook, I tend to make enough for a large family for some reason. Though I am cut out for camping with many people, my habits turned lead to some messy wastes at times like this.

**Fujimaru:**
But isn't it tasty?
This is so splendid!

**Martha:**
Well now. Thank you, Master. It’s just an incentive for someone who stands in the kitchen.

**Sigurd:**
….Indeed, it’s such a warm flavor. I think this is something that would be a family meal.

**Martha:**
I wonder. When I was making it for a family, it would generally look something like this.
You said it was a family meal...I suppose you’re right on that.
I made it warm, nourishing, and without trying to be fancy. I think that would be plenty.

**Sigurd:**
I see, I see.
I would be forgetful about the taste of homemade dishes since I’m an ancient hero.

**Fujimaru:**
Really?

**Sigurd:**
Yea.
I…*munch*....was raised with only my mother…. *munch* *munch*....

**Martha:**
Hey, don’t talk while you’re eating. You're a great hero, right? That’s bad manners!

**Sigurd:**
…..My apologies. *munch* *munch*....

**Fujimaru:**
(He’s chewing it all so thoroughly)

**Martha:**
...Well, that’s silent meals are another problem. You can talk in between bites.

**Sigurd:**
Makes sense.
...My father, the warrior Sigmund, unfortunately, died during a battle back when I was a baby.

**Martha:**
………
I’m....sorry to hear that...

**Sigurd:**
Warriors die when they are killed in battle.

**Fou:**
Fou!?

**Martha:**
Huh!?
Why did you say that!? Though the joke crossed my mind for a second!
….Ahh! I said nothing just now, I said nothing just now!

**Sigurd:**
My apologies. My nature forces me to say everything I think.
So much that my love advised me “You should refrain from trying to make jokes.”
Anyhow, with the death of my father and my mother’s second marriage….my upbringing was entrusted by a certain blacksmith.

**Mash:**
That’s-----

---

**Fujimaru:**
Could it be Regin?
Who is it?

Note: If you choose Option 1:

**Sigurd:**
Oh, if you know about my legend, then it makes the conversation easier.
That’s correct, it is Regin.

Note: If you choose Option 2:

**Sigurd:**
The man’s name is Regin. He adopted and raised me.

---

**Mash:**
Was he... strict?

**Sigurd:**
Of course.
Regin was necessary to train me as a hero. That’s why I was trained to become a hero when I was a kid.

**Narration:**
The principles of the sword. The handling of the lance. The technique of the bow. The arts of the axe.
I was taught on how to fight with every weapon in every way possible, and I myself studied avidly.
Along with that, I had to train my body.
I had to run from morning to dawn, dashing through the grasslands without making any noise.
I was taught how to hunt animals. I was taught how to defeat people.
I learned how to defeat heroes, warriors and soldiers. I even knew how to take on a demon.
---When I was a child, I was born to train.
---I had to accept the fate of becoming a hero.
---It’s not bad.
---It wasn’t bad at all though.

**Sigurd:**
….Well, looking back on it, it was very severe.

**Narration:**
---The words came out of my mouth without any hesitation nor realization just like that.

**Martha:**
Indeed it was. It was...very severe.
But, I’m surprised, Sigurd. I thought you were the type who would never admit you’re hurting.

**Sigurd:**
Indeed.
But the one I must profess my love to is absent. Here I have only companions who I can entrust my life with without any hesitation. 
It should be acceptable to let out a little feeble complaint. That’s what I had thought.

**Mash:**
------

**Martha:**
…..
Ahem!
….Let’s continue our meal, shall we.

**Fujimaru:**
Martha-san, you’re embarrassed…!

**Martha:**
Hey, focus on your meal!
….Well.
I got flustered because person from a different country and era could show this much trust on us.

**Sigurd:**
Hahaha, my apologies for that.

**Martha:**
Your cruel days… I can’t even imagine that.
But I’ll pray for you anyways.
In respect to your cruel days and the faith that allowed you to never give in until you became a hero.

**Sigurd:**
Indeed, it is as you say, Martha-dono.
My days were harsh and heavy.
But, all of that was the reason that I would be here right now. It’s something I can smile at when I look back on it.
Though, I’ll certainly beat up Regin if I ever meet him again.

**Fou:**
Fou, fou….

**Sigurd:**
That’s right.
Given that it’s already recorded in myth, I will keep it short: Regin deceived me.
He was planning on obtaining the treasure that was leftover after I defeated the wicked dragon.
And for that to happen, he considered eliminating me...so I became an obstacle to him.

**Mash:**
That’s...really terrible.

**Sigurd:**
Indeed. However, I turned the tables on him, as you can tell.

**Martha:**
I-I see. That’s the part you’re proud of.

**Sigurd:**
Naturally. I never thought of myself as a hero of justice once. However---
No matter how you put it, it is evil to raise me and then sweet talk me into a sneak attack for treasure.
So me turning the tables on him fits in the general idea of justice.

**Martha:**
Well, I suppose so. He deceived and betrayed you for money.

**Mash:**
….. Do you resent Regin-san, Sigurd-san?

**Sigurd:**
Well, when you say like that, I look back at myself and I don’t resent him particularly.

**Narration:**
---I certainly don’t feel any grudge.
---Just sadness.

**Sigurd:**
I am grateful that he raised me as a hero.
Above all else, if I hadn’t followed that route, I wouldn’t have met my love.
I suppose there is a fine line between good luck and bad luck.

**Martha:**
Isn’t that called being optimistic?

**Sigurd:**
….Is that what it was….!?

**Martha:**
You were shocked by that!?

**Sigurd:**
I was never called optimistic by anyone due to my formal personality.
I couldn’t help but be curious until now, I see...so I’m optimistic, huh…

**Martha:**
Being able to understand yourself after your death is a Servant’s strong point, I suppose.
From now on, you should devote yourself to studying what it means to be optimistic.

**Sigurd:**
Indeed.
In my opinion, you seem to be an optimistic person as well, Martha-dono.
You have a solid iron heart with a soft affection that surrounds it and you hold hope for others.

**Martha:**
Hmm.
….I see. I guess I’m optimistic as well.
I do believe that most times it’s better to take action than to be worrying.

**Sigurd:**
I assume you wouldn’t have been a saint if you weren’t able to do that.
I’m impressed.

**Martha:**
You’re making me feel a bit embarrassed with all the praise…

**Martha:**
Thank you for the meal.
At any rate. I wonder if there's actually a wicked dragon in this singularity.
What do you think, Sieg?

**Sieg:**

It’s certainly the same kind…. no, the may not be the same species as me.
But, with a presence like that, there’s no mistaking it.
Apart from that, the stew was very delicious.

**Martha:**
Oh, I seasoned yours fairly strong.

**Sieg:**
I appreaciate.
My sense of taste is duller than a human’s, so I won’t know what it tastes like unless it’s strong.
….It’s alright. It’s delicious.

**Martha:**
I’m glad, I’m glad.
Now then, since we’re done eating, then let’s go searching again.
This time, we’re going to defeat that wicked dragon.
...Or rather, let’s exorcise it...with a prayer and compassion magnificently to our frontline…

**Fujimaru:**
I’ll follow your lead, Iron Fist Sister!
How promising.

**Sigurd:**
Indeed.
A wicked dragon will be no formidable opponent with two dragon slayers, me and Martha-dono.

**Mash:**
Let us depart.

**Fujimaru:**
(I want seconds…)
Alright, let’s go!

**Sieg:**
Alright.
I understand how Siegfried fights quite well…
But this is my first time fighting alongside Sigurd. I’m looking forward to it very much.

**Sigurd:**
Alright, I will answer to this young boy’s expectation. It is a responsibility of a hero.
I’ll show you the best of the best.

**Narration:**
---I don’t smile. I can’t smile. It’s unnecessary for me to smile.
---I don’t get angry. I can’t get angry. It’s unnecessary for me to get angry.
---I don’t get sad. I can’t get sad. It’s unnecessary for me to get sad.
---I never particularly desired happiness.

“That's good enough,” said the blacksmith that raised me.
“You’re a weapon, a blade, a guard that protects the weak.”

I need to earn my status as a hero.
That eventually led into a tragedy.

….Those words of deception had a ring of reality somewhere in them.
Out of a million people, there will be ten thousand people among them that are outstanding.

And suppose you had to choose only one hundred people within those ten thousand outstanding people.
There is no one that is superior or inferior to the others in all three qualities: heart, technique and physique---

Those hundred people can do anything.
And out of those hundred people.
You pick only one person.
Such beings exist.

A mighty person that draws the blood of God, a person that embodies miracles, a person who holds nerves of steel, and a person who holds power which is not human.

We call those people heroes.
Those men and women are given life by the flow of history and raised by human passion.
Even I myself.
I may be even one of them.
I do not object to manifesting and swinging this sword.
This power could help the world.

Alas, however.
It’s hard to describe, it's some sort of pleasant feeling, it’s probably a habit.
It’s buoyant and it feels like somewhere in a dream.
It’s as if this is a------

**Martha:**
SIGURD!!

A dragon is in front of him.

**Sigurd:**
….!

A dragon stomps Sigurd, but he manages to dodge it.

**Martha:**
What’s wrong, you’re a warrior, why did you lose focus!?

**Sieg:**
Was the meal that delicious that it made him sleepy on a full stomach…?

**Sigurd:**
My apologies. I was thinking for a bit.

**Martha:**
So that’s what it was, I’m glad. I thought it was surely a mind attack.
I’m beyond impressed at how you can get lost in thought in front of an opponent like this.

**Sigurd:**
Sorry.
….From here on out, I’ll make up for your worries and discontent.
Master, your orders!

**Fujimaru:** 

[Sigurd, strike it at the center]

[Cover for Sieg and Martha-san]

If you choose Option 1:

**Sigurd:**

Understood.
Please supply me with mana, then, here I come!

If you choose Option 2:

**Martha:**

I’ll leave it to you. Whatever injury you have, I’ll immediately heal it.

**Sieg:**

I’ll activate my Noble Phantasm so that I can support you as well.

**Sigurd:**

And I’ll charge at it. Alright, let’s go!

---


In Battle:

If choose Option 1:

Only Sigurd will be buffed with the skill: [Dragonslayer, On guard!]

If chose Option 2:

Sigurd will be buffed with the skill: [Dragonslayer, On guard!]

The team will be buffed and enemies will be burnt with the skill: Martha and Sieg’s Support [We’ll leave it to you]


---

**Sigurd:**
Alright. Annihilation confirmed, Master.

**Fujimaru:**
[Thanks for your hard work---]

**Sigurd:**
Yea.

**Martha:**
That said, this singularity still can’t completely be corrected, we can’t let ourselves lose focus.
And Sigurd. Would you like to explain why you were lost in thought in the middle of battle?

**Sigurd:**
I should.
Thinking about it logically, it was inexcusable for me to think about something else in the middle of battle.

**Narration:**
However---

**Sigurd:**
I have made a mistake. I’m very sorry.

**Fujimaru:**
[N-now, now.]

**Sieg:**
I’m surprised that you can even make mistakes.

**Mash:**
I’m also surprised…

**Martha:**
Sigh… Right now, it was a mistake that we could cover for, to a certain degree, but it won’t be the case for next time.
If you think you can solve the problem by yourself, be sure to solve it.

**Sigurd:**
Alright, from here on out, I’ll be more careful.

**Sieg:**
….?

**Sigurd:**
What’s wrong?

**Sieg:**
Ah, nothing. It’s nothing. Probably my imagination.
(Is it my imagination that he seemed to be having fun…)
Hm.
Just a little deeper into the forest, I sense dragon presences there.

**Fujimaru:**
You know how many?

**Sieg:**
Many small, two medium and one big.
Thinking back on what I’ve already sensed, the smaller ones are wyverns and the medium-sized ones are dragons.
I presume the big one is...Fafnir.

**Sigurd:**
Then, the Singularity will be resolved if we defeat that, huh.

**Martha:**
Perhaps, yea.
...No matter how many times I encounter Wicked Dragon Phenomenon, I can never get used to the idea of fighting Fafnir.

**Sigurd:**
I understand how you feel.

**Sieg:**
Speaking of which, Siegfried says he doesn’t remember anything about his fight with Fafnir.
All he recalls is that the battle was like chess or shogi (?) in how making a single blunder can prove to be fatal.
He remembers this game state repeating enough times to drive him crazy, and he believes this is why he doesn’t remember how he defeated it.

**Sigurd:**
Fierce battles are often like that.
With my battle against Fafnir, I remember that I won, but I couldn’t tell you how I fought him---
What was it like, I wonder?

**Martha:**
You used that sword, right?

**Sigurd:**
I am only certain of that.
However, something is strange.
I was praised as a hero and a warrior, and with my dreadful days gone by, my name remains as a dragonslayer.
And yet, I can remember more of my daily life than my fierce battles.
I wonder if that’s alright.

**Martha:**
….Geez.
How unusual for you to second guess yourself. That’s a good thing, Sigurd. Without a doubt.

**Sigurd:**
Indeed.
Maybe once this journey to save humanity ends, our mundane days here will remain more memorable than our battles.

**Fujimaru:**
[Isn’t that...a good thing?]

**Sigurd:**
You think it’s a good thing, Master?
I see.

**Sieg:**
I sense presences from a cave further up ahead…. I may be imagining things, but their numbers feel higher than before.

**Sigurd:**
….This is bad, they’re probably giving birth.

**Martha:**
You’re joking, they don’t grow this quickly, do they!?

**Sigurd:**
It might be due to the Singularity.
It’s either that they have a strong leyline nearby, otherwise they’re holding the power of the Holy Grail.
Either way, we have to hurry.

**Fujimaru:**
[Understood!]

**ARROW**

You and the others are inside the cave and look around. The dragons there seem longer around their own kind. Fafnir comes and roars and in response the others roar as well.

**Martha:**
Ugh, it looks awful…!

**Mash:**
It looks as if we were in Orleans that one time.
We have to hurry before they overwhelm us with their reproduction speed.
Master!

---

**Fujimaru:**
[I’ll leave it to you to penetrate the center, Sigurd!]

[At the very least, take care of the surroundings first…!]

If you choose Option 1:

**Sigurd:**

Understood!

**Mash:**

We’ll clear the way as much as possible!
We’re counting on you, Sigurd-san!

If you choose Option 2:

Martha & **Sieg:**

Understood!

**Sigurd:**

Alright, first, we’ll have to manage against these dragons.

---

If you chose Option 1:

Sigurd and your team will be buffed by the skill:
Martha and Sieg’s Support [We’ll open a path]

---

**Sigurd:**
Here!
Demonic Sword, ready, special move driving force---
What thou see is indeed the dawn of destruction!
Bolverk Gram!! (Heavenly Wheel of Destruction)

Sigurd defeats Fafnir and the battle is over.

**Mash:**
Enemy is completely silent...it’s annihilated!

**Sigurd:**
Good.

**Martha:**
YEAAA!
...Ahem, good work everyone.
With that, this Singularity will be quickly corrected.

**Sieg:**
Guda, I mean Master.
Let’s do that.

**Fujimaru:**
[Let’s do it, let’s do it.]

**Sigurd:**
Hm?

**Sieg:**
Yayy.

**Fujimaru:**
[Yayy.]

You high five Sieg.

**Sigurd:**
What did you do just now?

**Sieg:**
It was a high five.
I don’t know much of it, but it’s a ritual you do after when a difficult task is done.

**Sigurd:** 
I see.
Then, I’ll do it too.

[Yayy.]

**Sigurd:**
Y-yayy.
….I see, this is cool.

**Mash:**
Well then, let’s head back. Thanks for your hard work, everyone.

**Fujimaru:**
[Nice work out there----]

**Sigurd:**
Yea.

**Narration:**
---Ever since I came to Chaldea, I surprisingly had many opportunities to smile.
I don’t know whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing. I really can’t tell the difference myself.
Heroes don’t smile. They’re the ones that protect smiles.
It was either Regin that said it or perhaps it was I myself.
At any rate, I entrust myself in an environment that my living self could never havegotten a bit weaker.



**Sigurd:**
…..With that being said.
From Master’s perspective, am I getting weaker?

---

**Fujimaru:**
[You’re totally strong though…]

[I don’t think so though….]

If you choose Option 1:

**Mash:**
That’s right.
Sigurd-san shouldn’t have had a hard time even since he exterminated Fafnir already.

**Siegfried:**
Yea, that’s right.
Sigurd-dono, what makes you think that? In my eyes, your strength has never wavered.

---

If you choose Option 2:

**Siegfried:**
It’s as Master says.
Your strength hasn’t been weared down at all….
Why on earth would it look like that?

---

**Sigurd:**
...I guess so…
First, I was careless on the battlefield.
And above all else, Fafnir is an enemy I used to be take down alone…
Yet, with the way things were, I couldn’t beat him without the help of other Servants.
“So I am weakening....” That’s what I thought.

**Siegfried:**
Certainly, seeing as though we are Servants, there are cases where we can be weaker than we were in our lifetime. 
For example, the Saber version of myself can’t use Tarnkappe.
If you think about it independently, we are, without a doubt, got weaker.

**Sigurd:**
So that’s what it was….

**Siegfried:**
...However, though.
Coincidentally, I don’t feel weaker at all than how I was in my lifetime.
That’s because---
we have a Master. 
And allies, who fight with us.
That would be impossible in a situation like in a real Holy Grail War, but for that reason we’re able to roil our powers.

**Sigurd:**
……
….I see, certainly.
Well, you have my gratitude, Siegfried-dono.
Though, I’d like to repay the favor in any way…

**Siegfried:**
Alright then, I only have one, there’s a person who wants to be trained.

**Sigurd:**
Hmmm.

**Siegfried:**
….hahaha.
Maybe you can understand what I said in the lesson.

**Sigurd:**
…..?

It cuts over to a simulated wide field with Sigurd shining his glasses.

**Sigurd:**
….That being the case, Sigurd has decided to train both of you.

**Hokusai (Saber):**
Of course.
I heard about the conversation from Sir Siegfried.
With this, I still plan to ascend the steps of sword fighting bit by bit.

**Sieg:**
Well, I’m not really a Saber, but rather a Caster…
Though in the grand scheme of things, many of my fights involve swords.
Therefore, I think this training will prove to be a good reference.
I look forward to it.

**Sigurd:**
….Haha.

**Hokusai (Saber):**
What’s wrong, Sir Sigurd?

**Sigurd:**
….Oops, my apologies. It’s nothing.
Alright, let us start immediately.

**Fujimaru:**
[I’ll be on their side.]

**Sigurd:**
Alright.
Well then---here I come!

The fight starts as Sieg goes on the flank and Hokusai goes for a direct approach. As Hokusai and Sigurd clash, Sigurd manages to dodge three slashes and pushes Hokusai away.

**Sigurd:**
While your movements are quick, your sword slashes are largely messy!
If you have multiple weapons, then you’re going to be hesitant on which one to use.
You must first overcome that hesitation!

**Hokusai (Saber):**
A-alright..!

Sieg goes on the side and stops.

**Sieg:**
There!

Sieg transforms into Siegfried and goes in on Sigurd. While he does overwhelm Sigurd, it is only for a bit before Sieg goes back to normal and Sigurd kicks him causing Sieg to drop down.

**Sigurd:**
You still rely on Siegfried’s power too much.
I can’t blame you for getting impatient when your transformation only last for an instant---
But you have more than enough time to use your techniques.

**Sieg:**
A-alright!

Hokusai charges at Sigurd.

**Hokusai (Saber):**
Ryaaa!!!

Sigurd clashes with Hokusai.

**Sigurd:**
Oops.
….For all you lost your hesitation, your attacks got more monotonous this time around.
Follow the principle of alternating feints and true swing, and try preparing at least three options to attack your enemy.

**Hokusai (Saber):**
E-ehh. It’ll be tricky.

**Sigurd:**
It’s also good to assign codes to your options and think about through conditional reflex.
For example, numbering your techniques.
Here’s a 4, 7, 2, 5------

He charges at the tree and slashes the tree up with pure swordsmanship.

**Sigurd:**
Simple, right?
Both of them:
......

**Sieg:**
I guess I still have a long way to get there….

**Sigurd:**
Is that so?
….Well then, it’s alright if you associate them with something else.

**Hokusai (Saber):**
Ah---
….Sir Sigurd, can I think about mine with pictures?
Sorry for the silly idea.
At least, I'm more familiar with that than numbers.

**Sieg:**
Then, I guess...I’ll think about Servant Classes.

**Sigurd:**
Why not?

**Hokusai (Saber):**
Yea, well then, young man Sieg! I’ll be going on ahead!

**Sieg:**
Young man….
Well, it’s fine. I’m next then! Let’s go!

**Sigurd:**
Well then, come at me as much as you like!

---

Skills:

[Let’s go with Berserker] (Sieg’s Buff)

[Yoshiwara Lattice] (Hokusai’s Buff)

[Let’s go with Saber] (Sieg’s Buff)

[Spring Night Beauty] (Hokusai’s Buff)

---

Both of them:
Huff, puff, huff, puff..

**Sigurd:**
Alright. That was not bad.
If you keep training without a break, you can pave the way for your swordsmanship.

**Hokusai (Saber):**
Finally, it’s over!
Well, this is it for me. I’m all out of energy.

Hokusai collapses due to exhaustion.

**Sieg:**
I would carry you, but unfortunately, I’m at my limit…. I’m sorry.

Sieg collapses due to exhaustion as well.

**Fujimaru:**
[I guess both of you fell in satisfaction...]

**Sigurd:**
There’s no helping it. I’ll carry both of them.
Well, however.
------This was the most fun I had in awhile.
….Hm. I was having fun again.
This is bad.

**Fujimaru:**
[I don’t think it is.]

**Sigurd:**
….Really….?

**Fujimaru:**
[Why don’t you ask the person closest to you?]

**Sigurd:**
….Alright.
Heroes exist to fight.
Heroes exist to protect the weak.
A hero doesn't smile.
I will surely become weak if I smile.
….That’s what I thought.

**Brynhildr:**
---Well, things like that happen.

**Sigurd:**
Oh, my love. What do you think is my weakness?

**Brynhildr:**
….
No, You’re not any weaker, my dear.
You haven’t lost the qualifications of being a brave warrior.
Long ago, you never grinned, yet, you always had the most heartfelt smile in front of me.
Now you’re able to smile.
You were never ever getting weaker---
You’re just getting closer to being human.
I think that’s very marvelous.

**Sigurd:**
I see…
If that’s the case, then I guess I have you to thank the most. My love, Brynhildr.
I couldn’t be where I’m standing now if I hadn’t felt fury or sadness in my lifetime.

**Brynhildr:**
….Haha.
You always, always tickle my heart.
But. I like that, my dear.

**Sigurd:**
….Wow.

Sigurd starts to blush.

**Sigurd:**
What a sudden surprise attack….

**Brynhildr:**
My heart is always, always, disturbed.
Sometimes I have to pay back…

Sigurd and Brynhildr have a moment together but Hokusai’s voice is heard and they’re startled.

**Hokusai (Saber):**
Oh ey... Wait, Oei is my name! Sir Sigurd, come for some training! Training!
I came up with a killer technique. I want to test it out...woah, woah!

**Sieg:**
My apologies.
We didn’t mean to interrupt your date.
Well, look at you, Oei. I told you it’s dangerous at night.

**Hokusai (Saber):**
T-t-t-that’s not what I thought you implied!!
Ah, i-if that’s how it is, it’s alright, there’s always tomorrow y’know!

**Sigurd:**
What are you saying, Hokusai.
A killer technique, right? By all means, I would like you to show me it.
Alright, my love. I would like to ask for your assistance with these two.

**Brynhildr:**
Understood, Sigurd.

**Sieg:**
And then...I would like to add one more person to join if you don’t mind.
He said “I really don’t know myself how I became a Saber!” so, I’ll be bringing him along.

Sieg runs and drags Saber Astolfo.

Astolfo (Saber):
Good evening! Sorry to interrupt your date!
But, I would like to thank you for delightfully training me!

**Sigurd:**
Haha...
Of course, I do not mind.
Though with that said, it is up to you to have fun.
My swordsmanship classes are often strict, often strict, often strict, and very rarely kind.

Astolfo (Saber):
Woahhhhh, I’ll do my very besttt!

**Narration:**
Even if what’s inside me is no longer fire, if it stops boiling up and burning,
Even if it becomes a feeling merciful like the sunshine of a gentle spring...
Even then.
Even then, I am still the hero, Sigurd.
I could perceive it now.
Of course. I can feel it.
The power built up within myself…
The power that explodes into a peak by the interweaving bonds connecting what’s inside me and what’s outside.

**Brynhildr:**
Sigurd.
Everyone is waiting for you, my dear.

**Sigurd:**
Alright.
...Well then, let’s begin.

**Narration:**
I will take a step forward while I respond to the call.
It has no expression, it has no mass, it has no form, yet, this energy certainly exists.
We call that, “love.”


**Sigurd’s Bond Level 6 Profile:**

Sigurd once received a prophecy about his future from the prophet Gripir. Already knowing about his encounter with Brynhildr, he thought he could never love the valkyrie, no matter how beautiful she was.

But here, he avoids mentioning the prophecy out of disillusion. Once the cold, robotic young man felt love for the first time in his life, he indulged in his love with the Valkyrie enough to forget the tragedy that would await them after that.

...Not long after, he came to a humiliating death, falling victim to an evil plan by a woman who loved him. However, Sigurd felt love. He recognized faint love in the maddeningly hot flames that didn’t allow betrayal.
