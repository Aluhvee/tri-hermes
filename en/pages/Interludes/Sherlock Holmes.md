## Thinking Back to Lost Times (Part 1)


**Holmes:**

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I am Sherlock Holmes. The world’s greatest and sole consulting detective. The forefather of all detectives, I represent “those who reveal,” the crystallization of the concept of detectives. I am one who leads you to new mysteries and truths.

Initially, I played an active role in the Fourth and Sixth Singularities following the Incineration of the Human Order case...but a new crisis has emerged for the world after the Demon God King Goetia was defeated and the Incineration of the Human Order was stopped in its tracks. In other words; the surface of the Earth becoming a blank slate save for the Lostbelts. The bleaching of the Human Order.

As you may all know regarding this major case, I was given a formal position at Chaldea as the Administrative Advisor. Yes, this position suits me quite well. Of course, I am still continuing to utilize my deductive skills as a detective, but maintaining the organization is also quite stimulating in its own way.

...still, I cannot be so optimistic. This is an incident of unprecedented scale. In a sense, I surmise that the case of the Incineration of the Human Order and the bleaching of the Earth are linked. Goetia incinerated human history and went back in time from the year 2016 to collect that energy. In other words, the Demon God King knew. That there would be no human history to be recovered beyond that year. He saw 2016 as a turning point and thus destroyed the Human Order from the past.

On the other hand, the bleaching of the Earth has destroyed the Human Order for the future. In a sense, it can be said that the Demon God King worked to avoid confronting this future. Since he began the Incineration of the Human Order before the bleaching of the Earth could take place, and attempted to recreate the Earth before the problem could materialize.

...it is a horrendous problem, a horrendous enigma. Even that Demon God King gave up on his “solution.” But even so, we cannot stop. We must take back what we have lost, the entire Human Order. How could we give up? As you experience numerous hells from now...you must move forward.

Of course, I will spare no effort. Even if my Spirit Origin Core is burned down to the last bit, I will work to resolve this case.

Why, you ask?

Why, it’s only natural―because I am the Great Detective Sherlock Holmes.

**Jekyll:**

...Mr. Holmes. The storage level modifications for each Lostbelt’s records have been completed. A request was also made from the Underground Library to keep a hard copy of the records in volume form.


**Holmes:**

Very well, I’ll approve it. Based on the current storage level, authorized personnel are essentially free to view them as they please. I see no problem. Nobody besides authorized personnel exists in Novum Chaldea, and all the more so for the Underground Library. I will notify the Director. Great work, Mr. Jekyll.


**Jekyll:**

It was nothing. Please let me know if you need me for anything else. I’m going to stay in the central computer room for a while to help Miss Da Vinci and Sir Babbage, but if you contact me, I’ll be with you soon.


**Holmes:**

Thank you.


**Guda:**

Those two get along? It looks like they’ve known each other for a while...


**Mash:**

Yes, Senpai! It feels like they’re used to working together, or have a sense that they’re close...it reminds me of the phrase “old friend!” If you think about a work or a group of works modeled on a part of their lives...I see... “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” is set during the late 19th century! It overlaps with the Sherlock Holmes series! The aforementioned series takes place from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century! And both works are staged in London!


**Jekyll:**

Oh? I see, did I never tell Master or Mash about it? How careless of me...

That’s right. I had some interactions with Mr. Holmes while I was alive. We were on good terms. I could only exchange greetings with him until now, but I'm finally getting accustomed to using computers. Hence why I'm taking the time to help him out like this.


**Guda:**

I see, you knew him while you were alive!


**Holmes:**

Hahaha.


**Guda:**

While Holmes was alive...?


**Holmes:**

Hahahahaha.


**Guda:**

Wasn’t it unclear whether he was a real person or not...?



[Flashback to Holmes’ trial quest.]


**Holmes:**

You wouldn’t mind a slightly tedious conversation now that you have asked, would you?



[End flashback.]


**Holmes:**

......I’ll be as elusive as I require, even now. Try not to spend too much time unraveling one’s past and mysteries. Though I haven’t been a Heroic Spirit for long enough to speak with authority on the matter. Mr. Jekyll’s past and mine don’t involve any noteworthy mysteries or anything of the sort, but the past is the past. If you dig too deep―

―――.


**Guda:**

Holmes? What is it?


**Mash:**

Mr. Holmes?


**Holmes:**

......it’s because I keep saying statements like that, that it becomes difficult for Master to trust me!

At this point, I'm not going to hide anything obvious. Indeed. I knew Jekyll while I was alive. We were acquaintances.


**Mash (fangirl mode):**

T-then, by any chance...did the Great Detective Sherlock Holmes vs. The Mysterious Hyde dream match take place...!?


**Holmes:**

Miss Kyrielight, you truly are an avid reader! Indeed, it is natural for one to take it that way. But unfortunately it is not such a flashy tale. Rather, personally......

......

It is a shameful failure for the Great Detective Holmes. I should not have avoided confronting Mr. Hyde―


**Jekyll:**

No, Mister. It was all me. At the time, I was the one who took care of the case documents. And read the one document I was told not to read. And...I could faintly see beyond those documents, a thread woven by a spider...it was also I who approached Moriarty, the pinnacle of evil.


**Guda:**

Moriarty? What did you just say?


**Holmes:**

......


**Jekyll:**

I was always fascinated by evil. That’s why I made sure to reach out to Moriarty, the spider of evil, no matter what, not being able to help myself from confronting Hyde, the evil within me.


**Mash:**

W-wait a second. Mr. Jekyll. In Stevenson’s novel “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” Dr. Jekyll develops a different personality due to his drug experimentation...it causes Mr. Hyde, the evil personality, to appear and even transform his appearance, resulting in numerous violent crimes being committed. The distressed Dr. Jekyll dies together with Mr. Hyde in the end―

I heard that Mr. Jekyll the Heroic Spirit lived almost the same life as in the novel. But...hearing your story just now...while you were performing the drug experimentation...about the Professor―

Does that mean that Mr. James Moriarty was involved in some way...?


**Jekyll:**

......


**Guda:**

― Jekyll? I want to know more about it.


**Jekyll:**

N-no, it’s not a very pleasant story. It’s rather gruesome, in fact―I never had any direct contact with him. So, um...


**Holmes:**

Directly, perhaps so. But what about in an indirect manner? The ingredients you needed for the transformation potion that you invented eventually became almost impossible to obtain. That was his doing. It became clear during the post-investigation that certain alchemical catalysts had been leaked from the Clock Tower for quite some time―


**Jekyll:**

A-AHEM! Oh, um, more importantly! Mr. Holmes! I’ve also something I’d like to ask you!


**Holmes:**

W-what is it?


**Guda:**

Jekyll, don’t dodge the subject! But what about the part about Moriarty!?


**Jekyll (inches closer):**

(Master! Um, I’m still unable to completely resist, so...if we talk too much about this, then I may become unstable...there’s even a possibility that Hyde may come out! So my apologies, just please...change...the subject...! I’m begging you!)


**Guda:**

(...well if that’s the case…)


**Jekyll:**

(Thank you!)


**Mash:**

Senpai? Mr. Jekyll?


**Jekyll:**

Err, so Mr. Holmes! You mentioned the Clock Tower earlier! Aspiring to become a great scholar, I touched upon many disciplines. I was a doctor of medicine, a doctor of law, a member of the Royal Society, among many others, and lastly arrived at the secret parts of alchemy, but even I did not reach the Clock Tower. Despite being exposed to alchemy as magecraft...mages, mage society, the Clock Tower. All of this I died without knowing about.

......however, is that not the case for you? After all, I certainly heard the words Clock Tower straight from your person. Then you must have been aware. That magecraft exists in the world...that there are unknown mysterious wonders.


**Holmes:**

......

......well, I suppose so. Indeed I did know.


**Jekyll:**

!


**Mash:**

The Clock Tower around 1900 A.D....!


**Holmes:**

I knew of it, but it’s not like I ever interacted with them. Back then I decided to keep my distance from their territory of mysteries. Humans are my domain. The cases I handle are limited to those acts done by humans. However...there were times where I unintentionally crossed the border. Take for example, in “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” that was―


**Mash:**

“The Adventure of the Speckled Band!” Um, do you know it, Senpai? If you don’t, then speaking about its contents would be...


**Guda:**

1) Don’t worry, I know about the case.

2) Sorry, I don’t want spoilers so keep it vague!



[I’m doing option 1 only by the way, don’t really see a point in translating option 2.]


**Mash:**

Okay! It’s a famous episode that was popular with readers at the time. The client was a woman living in Surrey, England...it was a case where her older twin sister died in a locked room. Her final words were, “The speckled band!” The truth behind this case was...


**Jekyll:**

The true nature of the speckled band was―a snake.


**Mash:**

That’s right. The true nature of the speckled band was a snake! The culprit controlled the snake through whistling...it’s a shocking conclusion. I have no doubt that fans at the time were pleased. But, it came with a huge pitfall. That is, in other words...


**Holmes:**

Snakes cannot distinguish the sound of a whistle in the first place since they have no ears. In addition, how milk was used to feed the snake, and the snake venom depicted in the story would not immediately kill a person, and so forth―the discrepancies are too numerous to count.


**Mash:**

Yes!


**Holmes:**

So, what actually transpired with the case...well, it went something like this.



[Film reel begins rolling.]


**Holmes:**

......this is a case of evil. A man with a brilliant mind and extraordinary skills, turning his power to crime. Dare I call this the worst situation possible. Now then. It is about time, Watson. The evil has come to the room in search of more victims.

― Have you a pistol at hand?


**Watson (played by Gordolf):**

W-what’s coming toward us!? And why am I the one playing Dr. Watson!? Hmm, I suppose you’re always taking care of everything as the Administrative Advisor, so it’s not like I don’t want to go along with your reminiscing. But to take on the role played by the famous actor Edward Hardwicke, how excellent, mhmm!



[Gordolf gets himself into the role.]


**Watson:**

......Sherlock, what exactly is coming toward us!?


**Holmes:**

It appears to be some kind of curse. That is the only way to put it. The domain of magecraft, so to speak. This is the territory of the Clock Tower. As if it were a dream, but in fact it is a nightmarishly wicked force! Most likely this is the work of a mage who has been kicked out of the Clock Tower, or the exact opposite, given a Sealing Designation. Now then―here it comes!


**Watson:**

AHHHH, IT’S COMING!


**Holmes:**

Dear me, what is the Clock Tower doing? It seems I have no choice even if I complain. Let us go, Watson!



[Battle commences. Holmes fights the "Speckled Band" hydra solo with backup from Watson.]


**Watson:**

I-it’s over...! (huffing and panting) J-just what the hell was that thing...?


**Holmes:**

It means the case is now closed. A wicked dark mage transmitted a corporeal curse to murder the victim―the curse has now broken. He will not escape the consequences. Most likely he is dead in the next room after having suffered the recoil of the curse. Violence returns to those who wield it, after all.


**Watson:**

H-huh? So when I was shooting at the monster, I was also shooting at the villainous murderer at the same time? C-couldn’t you have told me that beforehand? I fired off all the bullets I had...

......Watson wouldn’t say that. What to do. Sigh, this is more difficult than I thought.
But how was this case written into a book? The Clock Tower would immediately take notice if the course of events was written up front.


**Holmes:**

Hahaha. That is on you, Watson. I’m sure you’ll come up with a clever way of rewriting it and obscuring the details!

**Holmes:**

And there you have it. Afterwards, the published memoirs―or Sir Doyle’s novels rather, were understandably adjusted to present a different reality altogether. There were several other similar cases where each time, any details concerning the Clock Tower or magecraft would be obfuscated.


**Mash:**

Other cases...!? T-then does that include the Hound of the Baskervilles by any chance!? I’ve always had my suspicions about it! That it might be related to the Black Dog found in British folklore!


**Holmes:**

Impressive, Miss Kyrielight. Perceptive and quick on the uptake, I see. But that alone is not enough for you to get full marks.


**Mash:**

!


**Holmes:**

It isn’t just the Black Dog. You see, shockingly that hound and the Storm King are…

......never mind, I shall speak no more on the topic. It would be far more entertaining for me to consult with Mr. Edison, for instance, about adapting it into a movie!


**Mash (officially losing her shit):**

!! Ohmigosh...t-then, t-that means...A NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES MOVIE! MIGHT BE PRODUCED AT NOVUM CHALDEA!


**Guda:**

1) Mash, calm down!

2) Mash is fired up now...


**Mash:**

Yes! As someone who owns both the original novels and the film adaptations, this is a story I can’t pass up―


**???:**

My, it’s lively in here! Fufufu, what’s the conversation about?



[Helena enters the room.]


**Helena:**

Mash seems beyond ecstatic, but it doesn’t seem like there’s any tricks involved. Fufu, what's happening?


**Mash:**

Ms. Helena!



[Mash blushes and steps back.]


**Jekyll:**

Good day, Madam.


**Holmes:**

Hahahaha, but there’d be no reason for me to play tricks, now would there, my lovely Irena Blavatsky?


**Helena:**

Hmm? Who knows, you are quite the rascal, Sigerson.


**Holmes:**

Hahahahahaha.


**Mash:**

Sigerson! One of Mr. Holmes’ aliases used in the stories!



[A short time passes.]


**Helena:**

Mhmm, so you’re talking about the old days! In that case―have you heard the story about the Himalayas?


**Holmes:**

.............


**Helena:**

Come on, Sigerson...Mr. Holmes had that thing back then. I believe it was called “The Great Hiatus?”


**Mash:**

I don’t think I’ve heard about the Himalayas...did you just say “The Great Hiatus!?”


**Guda:**

1) The Great Hiatus, huh…

2) You know it, Mash?


*If option 1:*

**Mash:**

You know about it too, Senpai!


*If option 2:*

**Mash:**

Of course!


**Mash:**

From May 4th, 1891 A.D. when Mr. Holmes and Professor Moriarty fell to their deaths at Reichenbach Falls...to April 5th, 1894 A.D. when he reappeared in front of Dr. Watson after almost 3 years! That time period is what fans call “The Great Hiatus!” In the story, Mr. Holmes stated...that he was overseas in Tibet and Persia.

[realizes something]

Then, while Mr. Holmes was in Tibet...


**Helena:**

Yup. In 1891, when he should’ve died at Reichenbach, and the same year when I should’ve passed away in London, somehow...

― We ended up hiking together up the Himalayas!!



[Film reel begins rolling.]


**Helena:**

Seriously. What is the meaning of this? Did I do something to make the children of the Clock Tower come after me? They said they wouldn’t care what I did since I don’t have anything like Mahatma with me anymore…to think they’re sending assassins after me despite having never approached me until now.


**Sigerson:**

Perhaps they were wary regarding your *faked death*.


**Helena:**

Wary?


**Sigerson:**

The genius Madame Blavatsky, the leading figure in popularizing modern occultism in Western society, by removing herself from her public position, can now wholly focus her activities on the magical realm―or something of the sort.


**Helena:**

They really think I’m that important?


**Sigerson:**

Hmm. You may be coloured by your own perceptions. Western Europe in the late 19th century is currently in the midst of an unprecedented craze in the occult, Lady. Even if the realm of True Magic and the like cannot be attained, the ranks of people who believe in spirits and the paranormal, those who are not shaken by the condemnation of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), are denser than you think. It is now a societal phenomenon. The Clock Tower―even the Mage’s Association can no longer ignore it. Rumour has it that at the end of the last century, the Clock Tower was forced to expand one of their departments due to the influence of Count Cagliostro. Then by all accounts, of course they would concern themselves with your movements!


**Helena:**

I see...even though all I wanted was to be free after leaving everything to Annie.


**Sigerson:**

Annie Besant. Madame Blavatsky’s successor to modern theosophy.


**Helena:**

That’s right. I wanted to stop acting as an occult-loving granny who founded theosophy...I wanted to free myself from everything...from the British SPR who was constantly a thorn in my sides, to the Theosophical Society, and even my beloved Mahatma! I just want to live as a quiet and gentle girl full of hope and possibilities. Guess the Clock Tower won’t forgive me.


**Sigerson:**

There may not necessarily be a consensus amongst them. If Policies, or even another department behaves recklessly―


**Helena:**

It doesn’t matter. Sigh. I came to the Himalayas to enjoy myself. It’s the same for you, right? I want to go to remote areas that are unexplored and see winged demonic beasts I’ve never seen before! That being said, I’m sorry. Instead of Phantasmals showing up…we get a bunch of assassins...and their pet chimeras. Geez.


**Sigerson:**

Reinforcements, I see. Step back, Lady. I shall settle this.


**Helena:**

I’ll cover for you, Mr. Sigerson!



[Chimera growls and pounces.]


**Sigerson:**

― Now then. It’s time again to display the mastery of my baritsu!



[Battle commences.]

**Guda:**

He tossed a chimera!? This is back when he was alive!?


**Helena:**

He most certainly did. It went flying! Brilliantly, too!


**Mash:**

Mr. Holmes’ baritsu was just as powerful when he was alive...just as I thought!


**Holmes:**

Ultimately they were simply hybrid beasts constructed by the mages of those days. Nothing like the Phantasmal beasts you see derived from Greek mythology. Their bones will break if you hurl them against a wall, even if it isn't fatal by any means. Not much different from wild lions, in my opinion.


**Guda:**

I dunno, wild lions are also pretty daunting.


**Holmes:**

......well, I will admit they certainly are dangerous creatures.



[Jekyll smiles at Holmes’ words.]


**Guda:**

1) What is it, Jekyll?

2) Oh? Jekyll just smiled a bit?


**Jekyll:**

Ah, yes. Er, how should I put this? When I was listening to the story, I felt...a bit relieved. Being a Heroic Spirit in the modern world, um...



[Moriarty is eavesdropping at the edge of the screen.]


**Jekyll:**

I assumed that the mysterious being that is Mr. Holmes would be completely revealed. But in fact it’s the contrary! Breaking curses, even mangling and tossing man-made demonic beasts! You remain a mysterious gentleman as ever, in the past and in the present, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.


**Holmes:**

......that is a compliment, I hope?


**Jekyll:**

Most certainly, Mister.


**Helena:**

A gentleman of many mysteries, indeed. Mystery after mystery. And the biggest mystery of them all would be that topic. Right, Sigerson?


**Holmes:**

Hm?


**Helena:**

I have to ask, were you always a rogue Servant? *Or did someone summon you instead?*


**Shady gentleman at the edge of the screen:**

!!


**Helena:**

And on that note, how did you enter the Sixth Singularity...



[Moriarty jumps in and stops Helena from speaking.]


**Helena:**

Mmph.


**Moriarty:**

Hahahahahaha, well if it isn’t Madame Blavatsky! I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to refrain from speaking any further.

(Or else everything that I've prepared for will go to waste!)^1


**Guda:**

Professor! What do you think you’re doing!?


**Mash:**

P-professor?


**Jekyll (agitated):**

!

The spider…!


**Moriarty:**

Oh, please excuse me. It’s nothing really, I promise. I don't plan on doing anything to her, it's just I suddenly felt my magical strength deteriorate while I was nearby, you see...


**Holmes:**

Take your hands off the lady at once, Professor.



[Helena escapes from Moriarty's grasp.]


**Moriarty:**

Of course. My dearest apologies, Lady.


**Helena:**

No, not at all. Has it subsided now, your drop in magical strength?


**Moriarty:**

Yes, it certainly has. No need to worry, Lady Blavatsky.


**Holmes:**

......James Moriarty. The man is essentially the pinnacle of evil. An evil mastermind, the Napoleon of crime. A spider lurking in the dark, trampling over society without remorse. How many people have you hurt and killed, and trapped into misfortune? I will never let you forget. You boast about intending to do good, yet you continue to commit evil without even atoning for your sins…

[cracks his knuckles]

......if you attempt to grab the lady’s back again, I will have no choice but to use my baritsu on you. Is that understood?


**Moriarty:**

Oh dear, your nastiness is really rearing its ugly head! And I haven't even done anything bad! It’s true that I have committed crime after crime. Am I aware of that? Of course I am!

......nevertheless. Don’t get too ahead of yourself, Detective. I'm a far cry from a bloodsucker who snatches away women whilst laughing like a madman. What can you do to me with that much hostility? You must be thinking about it. Isn't that right, Detective―



[Holmes’ expression changes.]


**Moriarty:**

Detective. What a thrilling and remarkable word! That being said. Who are you calling yourself a detective, Holmes! If you're going to pretend to be an *ally of justice* you had better act like one! You're an adjudicator, one who arbitrates the truth and mediates all things in order to maintain human history. In fact―haven’t you stated this before?



[Flashback to Holmes’ trial quest.]


**Holmes:**

People do not need to know. They cannot know. That is why―I have been granted this Spirit Origin as a Ruler, as arbitrator and adjudicator. It is a role that arbitrates the truth, and mediates all things in order to maintain human history.



[End flashback. Holmes and Moriarty are both fake smiling as they are approaching one another.]


**Holmes:**

Hahaha.


**Moriarty:**

Hehehe.


**Holmes:**

Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!


**Moriarty:**

Fwahahahahahahahahahahaha!


**Holmes:**

First the noise block within the mainframe, then the war maiden's rampage, the introduction of Mecha Elizabeth following after...the list goes on―the King of Spiders continues to commit crime as usual! While acting like Master’s guardian, no less. It makes me wonder where the truth of you lies, Moriarty.


**Moriarty:**

― Hmm?


**Helena (forcing herself in between the two):**

Alright, that’s enough! Don't squabble with Guda and me sandwiched in between! And look, Jekyll is...


**Jekyll (bent over trembling):**

O-oh...no, d-d-d-don’t worry, I’m fine...hahaha…

[struggling against transforming into Hyde]

I’m fine, really...


**Guda:**

Um, you look anything but fine!?

Was that Hyde I just saw!?


**Mash:**

Y-yes, Senpai! Mr. Hyde appeared for a moment!


**Helena:**

Alright! Enough of you two fighting! If you still want to duke it out, I know! Why don’t you take it out in the simulator? Mash, if you wouldn’t mind!


**Mash:**

Huh…?


**Guda:**

Please, Mash! We’ll let them vent in the simulator!


**Mash:**

A-alright.

[runs over to the controls and starts setting up the simulator]

Initiating simulator setup! Um, so how should I assign the―


**Moriarty:**

The Legion of Evil vs. the Great Detective and company! Then off we go! Come out, *Hyde!*



[Moriarty snaps his fingers and Jekyll transforms into Hyde.]


**Hyde:**

Hey, it's been a while, old geezer!! Gotcha, I'll kill every last one of them!


**Mash:**

Mr. Jekyll, I mean Mr. Hyde, has appeared! He seems like he’s raring to go!


**Holmes:**

......oh dear. It seems we have no choice but to extinguish the flames!


**Mash:**

Mr. Holmes is also raring to go! Senpai!


**Guda:**

Battle simulation, start!



---


**Moriarty (pushed back by Holmes' beams):**

You~got~me~good~! ......oh, my clothes got dirty.

[brushes off the dirt]

And with that, I shall be the first to depart. Goodness, today's baritsu came frightfully close to landing my back! Now then. That's enough for today, Hyde!


**Hyde:**

HUH!? The bloody hell are you saying, I'm just getting started―


**Moriarty:**

Ahem.



[Moriarty snaps his fingers and Hyde reverts back to Jekyll.]


**Jekyll:**

......!? D-did...I turn...into Hyde again...?


**Moriarty:**

So long and farewell! Hahahahahahahahahaha!

[disappears into the fog]


**Holmes:**

Goodness. Has he no shame...

......

However, it appears we are in London surrounded by the demonic fog. Already a nostalgic sight for us, I suppose.


**Mash:**

It was in the Fourth Singularity that Mr. Holmes received a request from Mr. Babbage.


**Holmes:**

Indeed, that is correct. And I cannot say that I have fulfilled the request yet. It is quite frustrating, to be honest.


**Mash:**

……


**Holmes:**

― The Murder of the Human Order case was resolved. Goetia, the mastermind behind the Great Incineration, was killed but the second murder, the Bleaching, has begun. We cannot overlook this deadly murder, and what the Alien God's motive is behind this case...yes, the Alien God. A gargantuan mystery that is unparalleled. Even after traversing through several Lostbelts, it is still shrouded in a fog of mystery. I'm certain that the Ruler Spirit Origin was bestowed upon me to solve this mystery...

............

In any case, as a detective I must determine what the true evil is. I am now even more of a pure detective than I was before, since I am no longer living as a human being. In fact―you could now say that I am the very definition of a detective.

......*why am I a detective, you ask?* Why is it that I am pursuing this case? I don’t believe I’ve told you before. Though I’m sure Miss Kyrielight must know since she has read the series of novels by Sir Doyle and watched quite a few of the film adaptations. Then, how about yourself? What do you think, Guda?


**Guda:**

1) Of course I know.

2) ......I’d like to hear it directly from you.


*If option 1:*

**Holmes:**

I'm glad to hear that. Then let us review one more thing.


*If option 2:*

**Holmes:**

Very well. Then I shall tell you.


**Holmes:**

Why am I a detective? It is―for justice.


**Guda:**

For justice.


**Holmes:**

Yes, it is for the sake of justice. I am an *ally of justice*, if I have to be frank. Does that surprise you? Some of the best detectives of the day seem to be devoted to the logic behind solving the mystery, but I am different. Well, given the nature of my Noble Phantasm...no doubt that I also somewhat disposed to relying on deduction, but that is all. I am none other than *the Sherlock Holmes*. Detective Holmes mustn't forget where good and evil lies, precisely because the Human Order is undergoing a crisis for its survival. I cannot overlook any murders. It doesn't matter how big or small. I will not ignore any murder that happens in front of me, whether it is one person or seven billion people.


**Guda:**

1) The Murder of Pan-Human History…

2) ......what do you think about the Lostbelts?


*If option 1:*

**Holmes:**

That’s right. This great crime must never come to completion.


*If option 2:*

**Holmes:**

A serial murder of the world, so to speak. That is how I perceive it. And above all, the culprit has dirtied our hands. Forcing us to fight for our survival―this is an extremely cruel form of extortion that goes far beyond instigation. I will never let it pass.


**Holmes:**

............

......I will not tolerate it. Those who trample on innocent people's lives, ridicule all that is justice and good, and attempt to fulfill their greedy desires...

― I will not allow evil. For whose sake? No, it isn't for anyone's sake. Yes. It is for justice's sake that I take on this case. That is simply who I am. At any rate it is because I am Sherlock Holmes, the adventurous protagonist.


**Guda:**

Are you saying that as the protagonist of Conan Doyle's novels?


**Holmes:**

Hahaha. There may not even be a protagonist now, given the copious amounts of evidence that I was a real person. But I am still Sherlock Holmes the person. A detective who represents "those who reveal." The first consulting detective in the world. One of the forefathers of the "Great Detectives", countless of whom were born and played active roles in numerous imaginary worlds.

......then I must take some responsibility for it. 

― Plus, there is my pride.



---


**Helena:**

......avoiding the question, huh? Though you sure spoke big there. For the sake of justice! Fufu, you're such a showoff!

But you still have a big secret that you're hiding. Am I right, Sigerson?


**Holmes:**

Goodness. You simply cannot be fooled, Lady. But everything I have said was the truth. I am genuinely trying to solve this case for justice. And at the same time, it is as you have stated. I do hold a secret. And it is a great mystery I have yet to reach myself. In other words, whoever―^2

............

........................ [frowns]


**Helena:**

Sigerson.


**Holmes:**

......indeed. This is currently the greatest challenge for myself. Sooner or later I must confront it.


**Helena:**

*Even if it means succumbing to evil?* Are you saying it’s possible that you would choose evil for the sake of justice?


**Holmes:**

............


**Helena:**

I’d like to confirm. Are you saying you would associate Guda with evil?




**Holmes (pauses):**

― No, that is incorrect. That I can confirm with certainty, Irena. I am on humanity’s side, including Guda’s. Think about it. I am a detective. A detective who first and foremost continues to challenge justice.


**Helena:**

Really?


**Holmes:**

Yes, really. Lady, if I cannot reach you with words alone, let’s see...I will swear upon it. I swear that I am telling the truth.


**Helena:**

Fufu. What is it you’re swearing upon ? A god?


**Holmes:**

That is―

[stops speaking and pauses]

That day, back then. The scene I witnessed in that secluded cave in the Himalayas―



― Regarding your final moments, flowing with pride and radiance.

[Holmes deals a blow to one of the assassins.]


**Holmes:**

......hoh.

(Not letting go of the knife despite slamming him against the ground. An assassin from the Clock Tower. The last ones are always the most troublesome. But I won't let you go any further! You stabbed Irena when I left an opening!)

[begins strangling the assassin]

(I will strip you of all your possibilities then―you will never. Hurt her again.)


**Helena:**

D-don’t…



She said as she vomited up blood. Don't kill him, her violet eyes were crying out.

I nodded and dealt a blow to the assassin, stunning him and eliminating only his immediate possibilities.

[Helena is about to collapse and Holmes runs to catch her.]


**Sigerson:**

Irena…



Why? Why did she do that? Someone with her strength could instantly have killed an assassin or two―no. No, I mustn’t say that. This was her choice alone. A short while ago she told me this.



[Flashback.]


**Helena:**

Please don’t kill them. Keep everyone alive if possible so they can return home. This is my request to you, Mister. You see, I’m already an old woman. I may have no children or grandchildren, but it would be wrong for me to take the lives of those children. I may as well be dead, after all.



But Lady, you faked your death, is what I told her. She responded, “Yes. But once I rejected my relationship with the world, I consider myself dying."



[End flashback.]


**Helena:**

Thank, you...Mr. Sigerson...no...Sherlock…so coincidences like these...really do happen...no, I wonder...if it...was inevitable...?



I couldn’t understand what she was saying. And yet―I knew this feeling. I could sense it from cradling her body. The spark of life dissipating. She was dying. This is where her entire life would end.


**Sigerson:**

Irena.



I grasp her hand which has started to tremble.

― And then I see it. Is this really the embodiment of Mystery inhabiting the hinterlands of the Himalayas? Or is it a silver ship traversing the sea of stars, the transcendental master emissary who came to witness the end of his beloved disciple?


**Helena:**

Look, can you see that...Sherlock…?


**Sigerson:**

I can.


**Helena:**

The lights, are so...dazzling―



Perhaps. Tears were spilling down her face with her eyes half-closed...I wonder, if it was from the glimmer of the teardrops...―

**Helena:**

......Sigerson?


**Holmes:**

Hm? Yes, what is it, Irena?


**Helena:**

Shouldn’t I be asking you that? You suddenly fell quiet, did something happen? Now give me a proper answer. What is it you're swearing upon? I couldn't understand you because you were mumbling so much.


**Holmes (softly smiles before regaining his composure):**

That is...no, it is not something I wish to repeat. Hahahahaha.


**Helena:**

??


**Holmes:**

Hahahahahahahahahaha―


**Helena:**

?????


**Fou (shows up and jumps onto Holmes' shoulder):**

Fou, Foou!!

[smack, smack]


**Holmes:**

Hahahahaha―stop that―hahahaha. It hurts.


**Helena:**

My, you’re unusually sentimental today. Fufufu.


**Fou:**

Foou~


**Holmes:**

Hahahahahahahaha―

**Translation Notes:**

1) (Or else everything that I've prepared for will go to waste!) - This line only appears if you have completed [Moriarty's interlude.](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/ezryxd/james_moriartys_interlude_translation/)

2) Whoever― - The original line is 「誰が私を―」 . The full sentence is cut off, but essentially it means "whoever is (insert action) to me (Holmes). Based on context, it might be 「誰が私を召喚したのは」or "Whoever summoned me", but that's just guesswork on my part.
