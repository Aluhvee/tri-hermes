Note: Translated by Konchew [Part 1](https://redd.it/i5c7wc) [Part 2](https://redd.it/i5wfpm)

## The Queen's ?? Days

**Lakshmi:**  
...Sigh...  
  
 
  
As Lakshmi walks down the corridor of Neo Chaldea, she is noticed by Nemo.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Hello. Are you doing fine?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Ah, Captain Nemo. Feels like it has been a while since we last met.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Is that so? ...That may be the case.  
Seems like you can't help moving around constantly like a tuna would either.  
...So. You've been passing the time here for a while now. Is there something bothering you?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
.........No. There is nothing in particular.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
...Really?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
T-that's how it is. Yeah. Really.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
(If that's the case, then why has she been sighing as she walked down the corridor----Good grief.)  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
I've been carrying out my duties here full of energy. I've no worries.  
You are the one who's been spending his days busy with the responsibility and strong pressure that comes with being the captain tasked with looking after the ship.  
You shouldn't push yourself. Your work might be hard, but make sure to take a rest.  
If there is anything I can help with, just say so.  
No, it may be better to avoid leaving important thing to me in terms of crisis management.  
It should be something that's simple and won't affect a great number of people in case I mess up.  
Still, I recommend it to be work that is troublesome and must be forced on someone in the end.  
----Well then, Captain Nemo. I'm happy we could exchange a few words. See you later.  
  
 
  
Lakshmi departs which Nemo watches in silence.
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
And that's what went down.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
She's hiding something, isn't she  
  
 
  
**Captain Nemo:**  
Right? That's why I gathered everyone in secret like this, including you.  
Now then...the Nemo Meeting shall commence!  
  
 
  
**Nemos:**  
Yaah!!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
There's something troubling a friend from the same country and same period as us, right--? Of course we'd help her out~!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Yes, I approve~. According to the analysis of the data you've shared with us, there is a 99.999% chance of something troubling her; there is no mistake of it.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
That is an alarming situation. We must resolve both the troubles of the mind and the body.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Bakery:**  
Umm, first of all, as expected, should we divide into groups and inspect Bai-chan~?  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
(This is a Nemo Paradise...)  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
...That's true. Given her attitude, I doubt she'd naturally confess it herself.  
I feel sorry about it, but let's examine her movements in secret like a clownfish and gather some hints.  
If it's us, we should be able to do it.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Leave it to us~! We are everywhere, after all~!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
I'll use periodic medical examinations as an excuse to get closer to her.  
If I go with Asclepios-kun, she won't be on guard.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Bakery:**  
She might let it slip if she's fed delicious bread! I'll go bake some~!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Engine:**  
I can't lend you a hand from the engine room, but I'll keep a look out in case she drops by!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Nfufu~. We have this many of us.  
When gathered up piece by piece, we might be nothing but a scrap of thread, but if we are bound together, we'll become a splendid true mooring rope.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
I should pay attention and keep a look out too.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Yeah, it will be a great help if you lend a hand too.  
It's not like you have to look for secrets like a spy. It'll be enough if you can just make a guess.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Yes, she might be earnest and strong-willed, but she's no fool.  
If you grasp the gist of it and press her for the disclosure of information based on it, she might give up, thinking she won't be able to hide it anymore.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Alri~ght, let's do this~!  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Then, let us begin. The "Great Strategy of Investigating What Troubles Lakshmi" starts now! Hoise the anchor!  
  
 
  
**Everyone:**  
OOOOOH!  
  
 
  
And so the strategy commences. The Nemo Marines follow Lakshmi in secret wherever the latter goes; Nurse keeps a close eye on her whenever Asclepios gives her a checkup and Bakery stay close-by as Lakshmi eats in the cafeteria.  
  
 
  
**~ Inside the Environment Simulator ~**  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
Hm? That's...?  
  
 
  
We notice Professor and approach.  
  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Aah, Master. Your timing is perfect.  
"Did something happen" is what your face is asking. Hide here and take a look at that.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
That's Lakshmi-san...  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Yes, that's right.  
And then let us check that thing further ahead. That one.  
  
 
  
Like Professor instructed, we take a look and see...  
  
 
  
**Jeanne:**  
...Is that a garland?  
  
 
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**  
That's right. We tried making one, but it wouldn't turn out well...  
  
 
  
**Bunyan:**  
That's why we asked you to teach us if you knew how to make a good one.  
  
 
  
**Jeanne:**  
Of course, I don't mind. Let's try making it together, shall we?  
  
 
  
**Nursery and Bunyan:**  
Yay!  
  
 
  
Some time later.  
  
 
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**  
We did it!  
  
 
  
**Bunyan:**  
Yay!  
  
 
  
**Jeanne:**  
Yes, you make a really nice one, you two.  
By the way...where is the little me and...Jack who are always with you?  
  
 
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**  
Those two have something to do from time to time so they aren't here.  
  
 
  
**Jeanne:**  
I see.  
----If you could, please teach those two how to make a garland too.  
  
 
  
**Bunyan:**  
Of course! This time, we'll make it together with everyone!  
  
 
  
Watching this scene from a distance is Lakshmibai.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Hmm...  
  
 
  
And watching her from a distance is us and Professor.  
  
 
  
**Professor:**  
Did you see that? Did you hear that?  
That expression. And that sigh containing complex emotions with that "Hmm...".  
That must some kind of hint----wait, a shadow approaches our target...what is that?  
  
 
  
Said shadow in question is none other than Gilles de Rais whose unexpected appearance surprises Lakshmi.  
  
 
  
**Gilles:**  
Oo, ooh, Jean---ne! My beautiful holy maiden!  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Fwah!?  
  
 
  
**Gilles:**  
I have heard it, I have been allowed to hear it. That despondent sigh pregnant with significance...  
Indeed, it is a special skill of mine to read and understand her thoughts from the smallest of her gestures.  
If that were not the case, I wouldn't be able to support her from "good morning" to "good night".  
She just needs to clear her throat once and I'll immediately buy her a cola from the vending machine!  
If she stumbles on a pebble underfoot, I'll pick up that pebble and put it through torture! That is I!  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
No, like I said...  
  
 
  
**Gilles:**  
Hohoho. You can not deceive my eyes and ears.  
Nonetheless, I have no idea what she was looking at since I was captivated by her every single action in this manner. Still, I know of the reason for her sigh, indeed.  
Precisely! She...**was envious**!?  
  
 
  
Exposed so easily, Lakshmi starts to tremble in surprise, but quickly regains her composure. Or at least tries to.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
N-no, just what are you talking about?  
More importantly, listen to me.  
I feel like I've told this countless times already, but you have the wrong person. I am----  
  
 
  
Gilles cuts her short.  
  
 
  
**Gilles:**  
I understand. Speaking of which, you've acquired quite a tomboyish look for yourself, Jeanne.  
Yes, yes, this also has a healthy radiance to it.  
Coming into possession of a novel charm by coming here, as expected of MY! JEAAAAANNNNEEEE!  
  
 
  
Lakshmi can't help but stare in exasperated silence. Suddenly, Artoria (the Saber version) appears behind the widely smiling Gilles.  
  
 
  
**Artoria:**  
It might be coming from a passer-by like me, but this man's eyes are rotten. It's better if you don't pay attention to him.  
This is how you deal with it. I've been taught this by Irisviel.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
(A peace sign...?)  
  
 
  
**Artoria:**  
Well then, I wish you good luck.  
  
 
  
Artoria departs.  
  
 
  
**Gilles:**  
Oh my? I thought I felt the presence of a new Jeanne...  
Well, it's fine. The supreme concept of Jeanne is omnipresent in this Chaldea. It is an extremely excellent thing.  
And so!  
Her brilliance is my brilliance. If there is anything causing you distress that you can not help but envy, ooh, please, please, command me! I'll use anything even if it is the lifeblood of a maiden!  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Eei, don't sidle up to me!  
  
 
  
Fed up with Gilles' nonsense, Lakshmi beats him up. [This is where the Battle occurs.] But then, while doing so, she realizes something.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Hah...I get it. The meaning of that peace sign from before...Like this!  
  
 
  
Lakshmi charges forward and pokes Gilles in the eyes.  
  
 
  
**Gilles:**  
Hou!? This is the eye poke of Jeanne when she admonishes my eyeballs!  
There is no doubt about it; a new Jeanne has appeared after a long time and that is you!  
  
 
  
Smiling broadly, Gilles collapses.  
  
 
  
**Laskhmi:**  
Geez...  
  
 
  
Having taken care of the nuisance bothering her, Lakshmi departs.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Hohou. Feels like we've caught a glimpse of it.  
Since we've got the chance, let's get in contact with the children she was looking at so we can gather some proof.  
Miss Jeanne might have left already, but since I feel like the children are the important part, that won't be a problem.  
  
 
  
And so, we approach Nursery and Bunyan.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
Hello~  
  
 
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**  
Ah, Master and glasses Nemo! What's wrong?  
  
 
  
**Bunyan:**  
We're making flower crowns! Wanna make them together?  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
That is a very interesting endeavor, but let's leave it for another conference.  
I'm here to ask you a question today.  
Have you...played with Madam Lakshmi before?  
  
 
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**  
That's the Indian big sister, right? Hmm...  
  
 
  
**Bunyan:**  
We haven't played together.  
  
 
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**  
She always has a scary look on her face so it is hard to call out to her----  
No, even so, I invited her to play with us and to tea parties several times.  
Since she was close-by a lot of times.  
But she refused each time, saying she was busy or that she had something to do.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Umu...  
I see, thank you very much. That's plenty for what I wanted to know.  
  
 
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**  
Is that so. I'm happy if we were of some help.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Now then, Master.  
Let's pursue her.  
This information alone will ensure she won't be able to feign ignorance.  
I'll call Captain and switch with him. Pressure is important when it comes to things like this.  
  
---  
  
Next, we find Lakshmi inside the library, reading books with a troubled look on her face. Murasaki makes note of this and wonders if she should call out to her. Then she notices us.  
  
 
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**  
My, Master and Nemo-sama. Welcome.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
We have some business with that person over there who's reading with a frown on her face.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Hello, Lahmsi Bai. What are you reading?  
  
 
  
Our appearance catches Lakshmi by surprise.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
H-hmm? That's, um...this.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
"Flawlessly! The excelling superior officer's way of communicating!"...  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
...Did you pick this book, librarian?  
  
 
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**  
No, um...it is an anthology belonging to Lakshmi-sama herself.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
...I see. As expected, it is according to our investigations.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Wh-what is?  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
You managed to fool us before, but you are troubled about communicating with others, aren't you?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
 !!!  
  
Lakshmi falls silent.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
The gig is up, you know~  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
...So that's how it is. So that's why Master is here too.  
In that case, now that it has come to this, it would be disgraceful to deny it.  
Aah...that's right. Lately, I've been worrying about how to associate with others.  
Of course, I have talked with others on cordial terms and there are many people I get along with.  
But when it comes to those who fall outside these categories, especially Servants who resemble children, it slightly feels like there is a wall between us.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
A wall? How come?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
That's it. The problem is that I don't understand the reason why.  
I intend to do it normally, but it just won't go well.  
We are companions who face the same purpose. New comrades in arms and kindred souls.  
Despite that, for me to not be able to even communicate with them properly, I become worried if this won't lead to a great failure when it matters the most. If I don't do something about this...  
  
 
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**  
----I apologize for butting into the conversation.  
 "If I don't do something about this..." is what you said, right, Lakshmi-sama.  
That intense emotion is what creates the "wall" between you and the children...  
Don't you think that's the case?  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
The Servants who take on the shape of children. Obviously, there are many of them who aren't actual kids, but still, like a fish capable of mimicry, children sense the tension in the surroundings and create a wall.  
The tenseness of your atmosphere, and the way ou stiffen your shoulders gives birth to a vicious cycle...perhaps.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
I-is that how it is?  
Even though I intended to approach them with a gentle atmosphere and a kind countenance... (squeezing her cheeks)  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
(She's squeezing her own cheeks to check on her mimetic muscles...)  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
The way I see it, the problem is not with your strategy.  
I wonder if the root of the problem lies at a source you aren't aware of.  
That's right, for example...do you make sure to take a breather?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Taking a breather, huh.  
From time to time, I amuse myself by playing tabletop strategy games with Qin Liangyu-dono...  
I also train my swordsmanship on horseback in the Simulator.  
........  
Could it be that I was taking too many breathers?  
  
 
  
**Gudao:**  
No, no, no.  
  
 
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**  
This is similar to the warrior personages... Should I say she is always steeling herself or...  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Yeah. Tension, concentration, and a sense of duty. These have been indelibly ingrained into her body.  
The problem might be that she took that way of being as natural too much.  
You can tell when a person has gotten too used to the battlefield just from their bearing, can't you?  
Like always wrapping yourself in an oppressive impression unconsciously...  
That might become a wall when it comes to communicating with others.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
I-I see. But...then what should I do?  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
As expected, there is no choice but for you to play around properly.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
That's right. Naturally, an activity that "lets your mind wander" will be important for you.  
And so, the hand to play here would be----  
  
 
  
As if on cue, the Nemo Marines appear out of nowhere.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine 1:**  
Here, he~re! Like we thought, it'll be fine if we teach her how to put it into practice!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine 2:**  
Taking a breather is important on a long voyage! We are professionals when it comes to taking breathers!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine 3:**  
If you play with all your might, your shoulders will lose their stiffness and your atmosphere will surely turn gentle~!  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
T-truly? In that case, I am ready to request for your teachings.  
It's just, I'm a little worried. You know about it, right? The current me has received the blessings of the goddess of misfortune...  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
I am aware. However, did you think we would care about such a thing after coming this far?  
I have thoroughly experienced it in India. I'm already used to it.  
  
 
  
Lakshmi smiles.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
...Understood. If you'd go that far, then I'll be in your care.  
I have resolved myself. To obtain smooth communication skills...  
With all my might----I will relax and enjoy myself by taking a breather!  
  
 
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**  
(Aah, that resolution has already! Completely stiffened...!)  
  
---  
  
**Nemo:**  
...Having said that, we aren't professionals either. To make doubly sure, I have called for a pro at playing around.  
  
 
  
Said pro turns out to be Ushiwakamaru (Summer version).  
  
 
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**  
Hahaha! When it comes to matters of playing, leave them to this Summer Ushiwakamaru!  
From racing to tree-climbing, from hide-and-seek to red light green light...bring on anything.  
To think the [training](#fg "playing") I did in the mountains would come in handy like this!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marines**  
Master Nyotengu~! Master Nyotangu~! ^[1] (They are having fun for some reason)  
  
 
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**  
Oh my. My Master would go "What's with you getting called Master when your techniques are still immature!" and give me quite the thrashing if he heard so please cut me some slack with that.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
I'll be in your care, Ushiwakamaru-dono. I might be a novice, but I am fully intent on giving it my all.  
  
 
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**  
Such an earnest approach for playing around, I see!  
----Still, yes, just like I've been told, for some reason, it feels she's way too serious, no...?  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
We're depending on you to do something about that.  
I heard you're a master of playing, no? We're expecting much from your abilities.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
So, is it okay to play here?  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
The simulator would be a bit dull for moving your body and playing around.  
Among sailors, it is important to reduce the lack of exercise on the deck during a boring voyage.  
The dock goes without saying.  
...However, I can't endorse using the section belonging to the ship's engine for hide-and-seek.  
Nemo Engine's wrench will come flying at you. The one hurts more than my, the Captain's, attack.  
  
 
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**  
Naturally, games need rules. Let us be careful.  
Now then, let's move our bodies and get to playing, shall we!  
Hmm, hmmmm. Since we have so many people gathered here...  
I know, let's play the high-level game of tag from the modern age that I was taught by My Lord before.  
If I remember correctly----it was called cops and robbers!  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
The dream-like combination of hide-and-seek and tag...it is a game that both the cops and robbers can enjoy.  
  
 
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**  
Seems like you are confident in it. That's how it should be!  
My Lord, please explain the rules to everyone!  
  
 
  
As Ushiwakamaru asked, we explain the rules to the others.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
I see. A contest of opposing teams.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
It sounds fun!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
I'll just become a hindrance to the teams. I'll act as the judge.  
  
 
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**  
How is it, Lakshmi-dono? Are you ready to play?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Heh, it's alright. I have perfectly understood everything.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
In short, this is something that imitates the never-ending battle between the authorities and the criminal forces.  
A game which juxtaposes the absolutism of judicial process with the pitfalls of practical applications of punishment, via demonstrating how simple oversight in guarding convicts could render all efforts moot, even after a sentence of incarceration have been put into action----right!  
  
 
  
Lakshmi's impactful exclamation leaves everybody present dumbfounded.  
  
 
  
**All present:**  
(...Seems like there are many difficulties in store...)  
  
 
  
**Ushi:**  
We-well, let's begin for the time being! Let's have fun with all our might!  
  
 
  
The Nemo Marines run around with big smiles on their faces with Ushi in hot pursuit.  
  
 
  
**Ushi:**  
Ahaha! So you think you can compete with the mobility of a tengu! You'll end up getting caught, you know!  
  
 
  
Ushi's chase is interrupted as an odd creature who goes woof despite claiming to be a cat appears before her.  
  
 
  
**Tamamo Cat:**  
Stop right there! When you speak of playing, one must not forget the whimsical carefreeness of a cat!  
Eat the secret technique of Cat who suddenly became the main pillar of the team as a result of happening to pass by! Hidden Technique: Cat Clone!  
  
 
  
Side-stepping rapidly, Cat multiplies, and the clones dash off in different directions.  
  
 
  
**Ushi:**  
How mysterious! Well, I can do something similar as well. Since it has come to this, it won't end until we catch everyone.  
Lakshmi-dono, please provide support!  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Leave it to me. I circle around from the left and cut them off!  
(Having said so...this is way too chaotic. It can not be compared to any battlefield.)  
(As a commander, I was planning to make use of my experiences as suits the occasion, but just what should I do----?)  
  
 
  
Cat appears behind the contemplating Lakshmi.  
  
 
  
**Cat:**  
(Are you trying to read my movements? Having never even trained a cat, how pitiful of you.)  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
(What!?)  
  
 
  
**Cat:**  
(The ones who win the game are those who empty their minds...)  
(That's why, it isn't a game, but a blood-surging, flesh-pounding, brain-splattering contest...understand that...)  
(Cat is the truth of the universe. The truth are with the people...at any time...as long as you get cat food...)  
  
 
  
Cat disappears.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
(Empty...empty...empty as in the empty space, in other words 0 and nil which is the beginning of everything in the universe, which means just what in the world----)  
(...In the first place, why did I hear Cat's voice in my head...)  
Fu...fufu...fufufufu! I don't really get it, but it's getting interesting!  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
(Did she overthink things and run around in circles?)  
  
 
  
**Cat:**  
I expected her to go "Kya!", but it feels like it's heading in a different direction from that; oh well, as long as it's fun, that's all that matters woof!  
  
 
  
**Ushi:**  
That's right, if it's fun, it's fine!  
Now then, here's your chance, Lakshmi-dono, move your body as your instincts command!  
  
 
  
**Namo:**  
And so, seems like the time has come to seriously run away.  
Should I dash away speedily like a swordfish or should I conceal myself like a righteye flounder...  
  
 
  
In the distance, an unexpected guest comes into sight.  
  
 
  
**Gilles:**  
Oya? That is...  
  
 
  
Gilles eyes chance upon Lakshmi.  
  
 
  
**Gilles:**  
I see, I see. I understand.  
Seeing Jeanne returning to her childlike innocence and play around is also quite splendid.  
I shouldn't get in her way.  
However, yes...as far as I can see, there seems to be an imbalance in the number of forces, no?  
That can not be allowed. A passionate and lively charge is what Jeanne's battles are really made of.  
Let me provide some assistance here as the hidden Daddy-Long-Legs.  
Ooh, how refined...Certainly, I am the one who understands Jeanne the most!  
And so, let me flip through my book.  
  
 
  
Due to Gilles well-intended, but definitely unneeded machinations, a monster appears before Lakshmi.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
What!?  
  
 
  
Despite her surprise at the sudden appearance of the monster, Lakshmi cuts it down without hesitation.  
  
 
  
**Ushi:**  
----Splendid! What a skillful slash despite the starfish monster's unexpected entrance!  
  
 
  
**Cat:**  
(However...the cut part is spinning around...? I got a premonition! Something is about to happen woof!)  
  
 
  
The spinning monster bit hits the ceiling and...
  
 
  
**Nemo**  
 ! It hit the ceiling and the impact has turned on the sprinklers!  
Also...!?  
  
 
  
The starfish monster begins to multiply.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine 1:**  
Waah! Look at that, how gross! Regular starfish are our friends, but that's just no good~.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine 2:**  
It's somehow sucking up the moisture and multiplying vigorously~!  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Dear me, this is a bit...*unforunate*, isn't it?  
  
 
  
Those words have a bad effect on Lakshmi.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
So I've done it...once again...  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
I know who's the main culprit behind this. It's that telescope-eyes Caster, isn't it. Sheesh...  
  
 
  
The Marines run around in a panic as the sprinklers keep pouring water on everyone and the siren blares in the background. Eventually, we receive a transmission from Nemo Engine.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Engine:**  
Hey, yer bein' damn loud!  
Wait, the heck's that gross thing!? If you let those slimy things enter the engine room, I won't forgive you!?  
S-stay on the dock and get rid of 'em there!  
  
 
  
As Nemo ENgine ends the transmission the other sprinklers turn on too.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
For some reason, the other sprinklers have turned on too in a chain reaction. And so, there is even more moisture...  
I know this, I know this. It's like the monster panic movie from the library.  
  
 
  
**Ushi:**  
Well, even so, events like these happen a lot in Chaldea!  
Turning even this into a part of [training](#fg "playing"), let this Ushiwaka draw her sword too!  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
That's right. Getting rid of these creatures should be our first priority.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Apologies...! I have brought you trouble!  
  
 
  
And so we engage the starfish monsters and clean up the mess that Gilles cause. Afterwards...  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
Lakshmi-san, over there!  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
There, huh! Once again, with my fingers like this...TOH!  
  
 
  
Subjected to the Jeanne-family's true and tested sure-fire method of disarming him (getting poked in the eyes), Gilles collapses. Soon, MHXX arrives in full armor.  
  
 
  
**Heroine XX:**  
I came running after I heard the report! The suspect is him, right!?  
The villain Caster controlling the creatures from the universe of mystery...  
I'll take him in for questioning while helping ourselves two portions of those famous interrogation room unagijuus! ^[2]  
Thank you for your assistance! Goodbye!  
  
 
  
While MHXX grabs Gilles by the scruff of his robes and drags him away, our resident creepy Caster muses in wonder.  
  
 
  
**Gilles:**  
(Ooh...? Is there a faint presence of Jeanne even in the depths of this silver armor? Oh, lovely holy maiden...!  
  
 
  
After MHXX and Gilles leave, Lakshmi apologizes to us.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Phew...apologies. As expected, what just happened was due to that. Because of my misfortune, something like this happened again----  
  
 
  
Noticing something, Cat comes closer to the camera as if to cover up Ushiwakamaru who lands on the ground behind her.  
  
**Ushi:**  
Ahaha! It is fine, no need to worry about it! Rather, it turned into a fine exercise!  
Unforeseen situations occurring is one of the true charms of playing. It's fine if we enjoy everything as our hearts dictate.  
Ah, there was still one here. Soi!  
  
 
  
The sound of stabs echos in the background and blood splatters.  
  
 
  
**Cat:**  
Since she is smiling while her whole body's drenched from the blood spurts of her victims, her image looks like that so we can't show it upfront woof!  
Instead, make do with Cat's cute and happy appearance! I ask for your understanding!  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Well, many things happened halfway through, but how was it?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Yes. It feels like I have returned to my childlike innocence for the first time in a while.  
Moving your body without thinking about anything is enjoyable. I have reaffirmed that. It was time well-spent.  
...However...  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Yes, that's enough. Let's leave it at that for today.  
We still have something planned, after all. Let's have a taste of some indoor games next time~.  
  
---  
  
**Translation note(s):**  
[1] The Marines are saying 'Nyotengu' in hiragana here which would be "???" with kanji. It means "female tengu".  
[2] Broiled eel and rice served in two separate stacked boxes, with eel in the top box and rice in the bottom box.  
  
---  

And so, to learn how to relax and laze around, Lakshmi visits Ganesha, the best when it comes to slacking off. Ganesha tells Lakshmi to relax both physically and mentally and imitate the way she acts. As instructed Lakshmi enters the kotatsu, but she can not calm herself down. Just being inside the kotatsu is boring for her so she asks Ganesha for books to distract herself; Ganesha informs her that she only has light novels and manga before telling Lakshmi that these should be read while munching on chips and drinking cola. Lakshmi decides to refrain from such behavior and keeps fidgeting, unable to calm down.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Uoooh! I'm at my limit! You mustn't start doing practice-swings, me!  
I am here to learn how to play indoors, how to laze around. What I need is fighting spirit! Cease your shaking, arm of mine!  
  
 
  
Seeing her acting in such a manner, Captain Nemo wonders if this method of taking a breather might be difficult for Lakshmi Bai, personality-wise. His mutterings go unheard by the person in question who is busy being impressed by Ganesha's endurance. To think she would be able to put up with such training every day; as expected of a God!, she says. Though Ganesha can't help but feel like there is a serious difference in understanding, she brushes it off, more interested in being praised more. However, as a host, boring her guests is no good so she decides to invite them to a game that everyone can play. It is the latest VR game, a coop open-world RPG. Professor Nemo chimes in, revealing that the game is a technological experiment developed by Shion, Da Vinci, and her. While it is still at the stage of open beta testing so there might be bugs with the system and the resources, she can guarantee its quality. Since we are collaborating with the beta test, we get preferential treatment when it comes to the hardware.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
A game, huh. Digital games...I gave things a try at the recreation room, but basically they were all analog. I don't have much experience when it comes to this.  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
It's fine. It is easy to operate. Here, put these headsets on. Master and the others too.  
  
 
  
Before we put on the headsets, Professor Nemo informs us that since she is one of the developers, she'll monitor us from the outside. Then we enter the game and find ourselves in a town. Lakshmi is surprised by how realistic the game looks, claiming that one could even mistake it for being inside the Simulator. In fact, according to Captain Nemo, some of the Simulator's resources are being diverted for this. Since this is nothing but an experiment, it would be a waste of time and resources to create a VR game from scratch. As an example of cutting corners where possible, Nero points to the weapon shop NPC who turns out to be...Eric Bloodaxe. In order to save resources, the NPCs are based on the data of the outward appearance of the Servants who consented to have it used for such things. The veteran gamer, Jina- I mean Ganesha, advises us to buy equipment and since she'll foot the bill we can choose what we like. We follow her advice and buy a weapon. (We could choose between a "Blood-Soaked Axe" and "Kama's Bow".) Turns out the weapon was cursed and we are afflicted with its curse as soon as we equip it. (The Blood-Soaked Axe doubles damage received, but gives us lifesteal while Kama's Bow greatly weakens us against "Love" attribute attacks.) Lakshmi is not sure what weapon to get so Nemo advises her to buy something she couldn't use normally since that is the real charm of games. The Captain buys a shield and sword for melee-use while Lakshmi grabs a wand that can use summoning magic.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Hmm, it's light. Wouldn't it be too weak to crush the enemy's armor...?  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Normally, caster-type jobs don't engage in melee combat so you'll be fine.  
Now then, let's...Hm?
  
 
  
Ganesha is interrupted by Okki's sudden appearance. The princess remarks about the unusual combination of members present; she's especially surprised by Lakshmi being here since she though she specialized in war games with Liangyu. The other gamer Servant, Tomoe isn't around and Okki confirms that she is alone this time. However, she quickly shifts gears, saying she's in a hurry and asks Ganesha to look at her map. A rare quest seems to have appeared. Since the probability of getting rewards eve if everyone joins her in completing said quest, Okki asks us to lend her a hand. We consent and depart for the forest.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Un. Not a march or an escape, but a simple journey; such a thing can be quite pleasant too.  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Oh. Are you having fun?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Yes. Before, my head was so full of matters about allies, enemies, things I ought to do, things I must not do, and things I must do that I was basically desperate to move from place to place.  
Moving forward while enjoying the scenery and engaging in silly conversations with my friends like this...  
This might be my first time experiencing this.  
  
 
  
**Okki:**  
Joining forces and defeating monsters is your first too, right?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Fufu. Waving a wand and summoning spirits(?) too. It is a very valuable experience.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
I----not Nemo, but Triton, might not have traveled on foot on the surface like this.  
It is certainly fresh, but I'm starting to miss my ship a little.  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Wait for the patches for the sea and underwater stages~.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
I don't think that's the problem here...  
  
 
  
Nemo draws closer to us.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
(whispering)...In any case, the game bringing her enjoyment in its own way is what's the most important.  
It would be great if she could learn how to take a breather properly this way, but...  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
Let's hope for the support of the indoor experts.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
...Although it is a bit worrying that they are too well-versed in it. Well, I have no complaints about their escorting so far.  
  
 
  
As we keep advancing through the forest, Okki calls out to us. Seems like we reached the location of the quest. In the distance, we can see Blackbeard and Anastasia. According to Ganesha, the rare quest is a rescue quest asking for the rescue of the princess from the clutches of a bandit.  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Would we get a reward from the king if we rescue her? Now then, let's quickly----  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Fumu. An easy to understand cast. A beautiful princess and a villain trying to violate her...  
Even if it's made-up, I won't overlook it. Become rust on this summoning magic wand!  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
(Unexpectedly, it seems like she took a liking to her mage job.)  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
...? Still, their state is a bit...  
  
 
  
Looking back at the quest targets, we can see Anastasia slowly approach a frightened Blackbeard.  
  
 
  
**??? (Anastasia)**  
Hehehe. It's useless to scream, Princess.  
  
 
  
**??? (Blackbeard):**  
Iyaah! Don't come closer, you brute!  
  
 
  
...It seems like the roles are reversed. Anastasia is the bandit and Blackbeard is the princess. This messed up quest must be the handiwork of Da Vinci-chan.  
  
 
  
**Heinous and inhuman bandit (Anastasia):**  
Oh oh, even your crying and screaming face is cute, Princess. But just how long will your elegant face last?  
Just what will happen to you now...you're fully aware of it, aren't you, huh?  
Or does the sheltered princess have no idea?  
  
 
  
**Beautiful Princess (Blackbeard):**  
No, don't come closer! I-I know...you're going to do something terrible to me, something Poseidon or Zeus would do!  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
...Just what goes through the heads of the Greek gods...  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
Anastasia with a threatening voice...nice!  
  
 
  
**Okki:**  
This isn't the time to be enjoying it! Though I admit it is interesting!  
  
 
  
Indeed, no matter how interesting the current situation might be since it is a quest there is only one thing for us to do. Saving the princess(?)! And so, we attack the bandit and send her packing. It was quite easy which Ganesha makes sure to point out. The enemies are too weak and difficulty is low so there is no challenge. Lakshmi wonders if that's the case, but Okki quickly warns her not to use Ganesha as a standard.  
  
 
  
**Okki:**  
Unlike Hime who's just cheating on the manuscript (with this game), she's a bonafide no-life gamer.  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Well, I'm the speedrun champion. Ain't it obvious that the more time you put into it, the stronger you'll get?  
My current status is pretty much god level! I have no opponent in the world! Hahaha!  
I'd like them to implement a hard mode and something even harder than that!  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Good grief, a god who gets carried away will turn into a good-for-nothing most of the time.  
I'd like her to be careful with that, but...Hm? Seems like there was one more enemy left.  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Ah, then I'll leave it to Lakshmi-san to defeat them.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
I'm not inclined to carry out some meaningless hunt for remnants, but if they are heading for us instead of running away then it can't be helped.  
Alright, then I'll summon some spirits for offense again----  
  
Lakshmi begins to summon and with a crash of lightning something appears. Confused, Lakshmi says that something different from what she intended to summon has appeared. Seems like one can randomly summon a rare spirit in this game. As the smoke clears, the spirit Lakshmi summoned is revealed to be...Parvati.  
  
 
  
**Parvati:**  
Are there any bad kids who do nothing but play games here...?  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
She's saying a namahage^[1] like line while smiling!  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Eek, Maman----no, Mother!? Why are you here!?  
No, wait, Ahaha.    
It's a game so this is some ill-natured rarely produced thing. No way it could be anything but that.  
To think she'd let them use her data, that's unexpected... Well, in any case, it's just an NPC that is using the data of her appearance, in the end.  
Hahan, it's not scary at all! Are you doing fine, Mother!? Just kidding! (hitting noises)  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
She's doing something she can't normally do...  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Wait, there is something wrong with the wand. Don't do as you please... It's not over yet!  
  
 
  
The wand shines and more Parvatis are summoned accompanied by lightning. Seeing the increasing number of her Mom, Ganesha freaks out and even Okki is afraid. Professor Nemo chooses this moment to contact us.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Hello, good day. Here's an emergency report from the administration. The program is bugging out, it's bugging out~.  
Unexpected NPC data is continuously being generated without permission. They are the type that can be battled to boot.  
Seems like the game has been magically connected to the Simulator somehow, probably due to the presence of a god~.  
In other words, the situation over there right now is sort of like the Simulator.  
If your avatar is chipped at, your own Saint Graph might also take a hit from the magical feedback, you know?  
The forced log out command isn't being accepted either... I can take care of it manually, but it will take some time. During that time, while it might be a bother, please do something about it with your own strength.  
  
 
  
Hearing the news, Lakshmi shudders.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
...Did I----mess things up once again?   
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
........  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
I take back what I said about the difficulty not being hard enough! ----I don't want such a nightmare!  
  
We engage the Parvatis in combat, but the numbers are too high. Just as we are about to be overwhelmed something happens and they disappear.  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Haah, haah, haah. W-we won...! I can feel the joy of being alive after a long while!  
Actually, weren't they only aiming for me? It's true that I was slacking off on my duties as a god though!  
  
 
  
The Professor contacts us once again. Seems like she managed to fix the problem.  
  
With a bitter expression, Lakshmi calls out to us.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
...Everyone, I apologize. This game----let's end it here.  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Hm, that's true. I haven't broken out in cold sweat from a game in a while.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
...I am sorry...  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
..............  
  
 
  
And so, the gaming session ends here. Later, we find Lakshmi in the library once again in the company of a fidgeting Shikibu.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
Curiously, Lakshmi-san has her head in her arms on the desk, like an unmotivated and hopeless student...  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
As expected...it's no good. My bad luck and misfortune are always present.  
I cause nothing but trouble to others like this.  
In that case, like I thought, it would be better if I didn't get close to others unless necessary----  
  
 
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Wa~n, I can't watch this. She's super depressed~.  
  
 
  
**Nemo Bakery:**  
It's alright, with what has happened so far, we got the gist of the problem~.  
If he understands the problem, Captain's actions will be swift?  

 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
After all, if a captain can't make swift decisions, they aren't fit for the job, right?  
  
 
  
Speak of the devil; Captain Nemo enters the library.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Lakshmi, can I have some of your time?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
No...right now, I'm...not really in the mood. If you'd like to talk, let's do it another ti----  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
It's related to your problem.  
As a commander, if your army has issues, to listen to the analysis of said issue would be the logical move, no?  
  
 
  
Hearing Nemo's words, Lakshmi springs to her feet in surprise.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
That's true. However, my problem would be...?  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
Yes. If you were to put it into words, it's quite simple. Your biggest problem would be----  
That you are underestimating us.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
What do you mean by that...?  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
And so I asked the two teachers to accompany me here. Now then, you two, go ahead and give us your impressions.  
  
(Summer) Ushiwakamaru and Ganesha appears.  
  
 
  
**Ushi:**  
My impressions about today?  
*I enjoyed myself quite a lot*, obviously!  
A lot of things happened, but that's exactly why! Let's say I managed to have an unforgettable playing session!  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
I was astonished it was so frightening...  
But I managed to taste a thrill I haven't felt in a long while so yes, as a gaming experience, it was super fun.  
If it wasn't a game, I feel like I did something real disrespectful, but that will be one of my top secrets.  
I wish it will all disappear from the logs.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
Incidentally, I had fun too.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
 !!  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
...Do you get it?  
That's how we felt about that bad luck and misfortune you've been worrying yourself over as if the world was going to end.  
To put it another way...right.  
Because of that bad luck, you thought you needed to put a wall between us to some extent so we could be friends.  
But even so, that doesn't mean you hate that power of the goddess of misfortune or that you want to throw it away.  
Isn't that right?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
That goes without saying!  
I am...grateful to her. I can be here exactly because she is with me.  
I can fight as a Servant. There is no point in thinking "what if that weren't the case" and such.  
That is the current me, after all.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
That's right. You've accepted that bad luck of yours as an inseparable part of yourself----  
We have also accepted it as a part of you. Just like you.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
 !!  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
That's why this is related to what I said before.  
You shouldn't underestimate us so much. I want you to trust us.  
Or are we so weak that you can't trust us?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
That's----  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
We acknowledge that this is what makes you. You should just act more naturally.  
Truly, that's all you need.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Aah...I see. Perhaps, that's how it is.  
Up until now, the only thing I was thinking of when it came to my bad luck was to try and not cause anyone trouble or harm them----  
Perhaps, I was mistaken. There might be a different meaning to it.  
This too----might be one of my connections to you...  
  
 
  
The Nemos smile.  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
This is something from this Ganesha-san who's from the same country as you. A welcome advice coming from the voice within.  
"Bad luck and misfortune are two sides of the same coin".  
  
 
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
(In truth, it can also be interpreted as the [goddess of misfortune](#fg "Alakshmi") being nothing but another aspect of the [goddess of fortune]("fg "Lakshmi"), right...)  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
...Right. One can feel neither bad luck nor misfortune if one isn't alive.  
It is a result of "me definitely existing here".  
If I think about it again...they weren't often around the me who ended her life so quickly.  
I didn't have the time to feel them in the midst of battle as I put up a desperate resistance every day.  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
But you can feel them now?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Yes. For the days filled with bad luck and misfortune to "continue"----  
That may be precious in itself. I have noticed that for the first time just now.  
Without realizing such an obvious thing, I feel like I was only frantically seeking the results of battle...  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Yeah. I've heard the story, but, for example, the method to get along with children is not something you can learn in a day.  
Even for me such a skill is a delicate subject.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Long ago...I lost my child when he was young. This eventually became one of the factors that contributed to that Great Rebellion.  
No, after that, I adopted a child and our relationship wasn't but, but...  
Like I thought, the time we spent together was short.  
That's why, thinking about it, it is my first experience with "struggling on how to interact with children".  
With such little experience, it's no wonder that it turned out like this.  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
This is your first time trying to find ways to interact with children and people outside the battlefield while keeping an eye on your bad luck and misfortune.  
You are starting to do things you couldn't in the past----  
...It is obvious you would be perplexed. There is no need to come to an answer as soon as possible.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Fufu. I still don't understand myself well enough.  
It was presumptuous of me to think I could fight well enough.  
If you rush into an assault without understanding the strength and nature of your army, it is an obvious fact that something will be waiting for you...  
  
 
  
**Shikibu:**  
I know this is quite abrupt, but I would like to make a suggestion!  
As I was listening to your discussion, I was struck with an idea...  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
What is it, what is it?  
  
 
  
**Shikibu:**  
Lakshmi-sama...how about writing a diary?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Diary?  
  
 
  
**Shikibu:**  
Yes. Record yourself on paper.  
There will be a self separate from you inside the diary you wrote.  
Look back on your daily life and face yourself.  
And then, along with that, think about the relationship between you and your surroundings...----  
You can use simple sentences. How about giving it a try once here?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Hmm...?  
  
 
  
**Ushi:**  
Lakshmi-dono's diary! 
It feels like that would turn into an entertaining read!  
I'm excited to see what sudden and novel games happened today!    
You want to do it again, right, that "Killing Hundreds of Sea Demon on the Docks"!  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Wait. Are diaries meant to be shown to others?  
  
 
  
**Shikibu:**  
I-I wonder?  
For me who is aware that her own diary has been read by a vast number of people...it is hard to say anything about that...  
  
 
  
**Ganesha:**  
Isn't it fine if you start out from the beginning with the assumption that it will be read by others?  
An experimental SNS made by Da Vinci-san and Shion-san to amuse themselves similar to that game...  
Its name was, as I recall, Servastagram! ^[2]  
  
 
  
**Guda:**  
There was something like that!?  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
This is my first time hearing about it too, but...they say whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.  
It may be a thing where one can continue exactly because they can be seen by others.  
This is----the time to decide. Shall I give it a try...!  
  
 
  
**Nemo:**  
The logbook is important. I think it's a fine idea.
By rereading it, many discoveries can be born, and by reading that, another ship can learn from it.  
  
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
Umu. Captain Nemo...play around to relax and build a smooth relationship with others; I understand that such guidelines to the beginning are still a way off for me.  
Most importantly, first of all, I should think of a method to get along with others that is more like me.  
Like you said----I will believe in the others.  
I noticed this thanks to you. I am grateful.  
One way or another, from now, I'll be myself.  
...But, well.  
I think I understand how to relax a bit more compared to before----  
  
 
  
The scene shifts from the library to a corridor in Chaldea.  
  
 
  
**Narrator:**  
And so, Lakshmi Bai's diary that she started posting on Servastagram----  
It was serious and polite, lacking any excess embellishments and written similar to a report.  
For reasons such as "reading it somehow made me all lively" "oddly enough, it makes me feel positive" "it is ideal for magical observations related to the passage of fortune and celestial bodies", it was surprisingly well-received by readers.  
Below is a part of this journal.  
"? Month x Day: ----I met the children today and we played with them for a bit."  
  
 
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**  
Ufufu! What's this, it's so much fun!  
  
 
  
**Jalter Lily:**  
It feels somewhat dangerous, but it's fun!  
  
**Bunyan:**  
Waah! It's terrific!  
  
 
  
**Jack:**  
More, do it more!  
  
 
  
**Narrator:**  
"...Like always, I caused some trouble, but I started to think that that's fine too."  
"Obviously, only if it makes the other party smile. As expected, I don't want to get used to causing trouble itself."  
"It's just----the children are Servants too. They must have experienced bad luck and misfortune I haven't seen yet."  
"I think that's exactly why my bad luck possesses a power that can make them laugh."  
"...I must not underestimate them. Just like this, I should keep interacting with them and learn."  
"I have learned a lot today. ----I was fortunate."  
  
 
  
The scene shifts to the cafeteria.  
 
 
  
**Narrator:**  
"? Month ? Day: ---I was fortunate."  
  
 
  
The scene shifts to the docks.  
 
 
  
**Narrator:**  
"? Month ? Day: ---I was fortunate."  
  
 
  
The scene shifts to My Room.  
 
 
  
**Narrator:**  
"? Month ? Day: ---I was fortunate."  
  
 
  
The scene shifts to a corridor once again.  
 
 
  
**Lakshmi:**  
...Aah, it's you guys.  
  
 
  
**Narrator:**  
"? Month ? Day: ----Today, I met----"  
  
 
  
Nemo and Guda show up.  
  
 
  
**Narrator:**  
"...reliable comrades who made me realize something important."  
"Aah----"  
"----Today as well, I live surrounded by good luck."
