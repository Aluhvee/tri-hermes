## Prologue

**A Magician:**
Come in, come in. I trust you can hear me, you, whose fate is yet unknown.

**A Magician:**
Or are you that starry-eyed one I met on that day? Well, it doesn't matter.

**A Magician:**
I'm stricken with boredom. Would you mind listening to me for a bit?

**A Magician:**
These aren't my own words, though. It's a song I heard, carried on the wind.

**Narration:**
“From now, I will tell you of a future. The future of the mystical island which became the land of fairies.”

**Narration:**
“The innocent shall return. To the Queen's castle, bottomless as it is.”

**Narration:**
“Accumulating, accumulating; like rain, like ashes. Fading away, fading away; like snow, like the unbelievable.”

**Narration:**
“Our hopes are at the ledge; still held within the palm of the queen's hand.”

**Narration:**
“Yet we must only endure a short time more. The morning when two thousand years have passed, the child of salvation will appear.”

**Narration:**
“They who unites fairies and humans, us and them. The child of salvation who will save the world.”

**Narration:**
“Like a moth to the flame. Even if it begins as but an ember, even if it cannot be seen.”

**Narration:**
“A city of iron, a sea of soot. When the calamity has been repelled, the pilgrimage will be hailed.”

**Narration:**
“Guided by the Staff of Selection, watched over by a foreign traveller, the child of salvation will reach the throne.”

**Narration:**
“The true king takes their place on the throne. A bloodstained crown presented.”

**Narration:**
“Ring out, ring out; like thunderous fury, like fiery lamentation. Let the six bells toll in demonstration. Make way for the true king.”

**Narration:**
“Before the red calamity reaches us. Before the black calamity bites.”

**Narration:**
“Although our work may be neglectful, we are descended of free fairies.”

**Narration:**
“Ever absent is our hope. A shining tomorrow is desired.”

**A Magician:**
What do you think? Isn't it just like one of those songs where it doesn't quite get the point across, yet you can still understand it somehow?

**A Magician:**
I mean, that's just how prophecies are. The meaning may be ambiguous when you're first hearing it.

**A Magician:**
“You'll know it when it happens,” you know. Like a curse secretly stuck on your back.

**A Magician:**
Uh-oh, I've been spotted by a scary lady. This is all I can do for you right now.

**A Magician:**
Will the next time we meet be after everything is over?

**A Magician:**
It's a pity I can't join in the battle, but it's a relief knowing I don't have to worry.

**A Magician:**
Well then, until we meet again. I'll be waiting in the land of imprisonment, looking forward to that time.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Was that...a dream?|


---

**Fou:**
......

**Sion:**
Ahem&ndash;testing, testing. Good morning, Sion speaking.

**Sion:**
The time is just before 7 AM. I'm really sorry to be spoiling the solemn atmosphere,

**Sion:**
but this is a notification for all staff of Novum Chaldea.

**Sion:**
Movement has been detected in the sixth Lostbelt. The predicted emergency has now occurred.

**Sion:**
Please do not panic, and gather in the control room quickly.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, no! Let's go, Fou!|


---

**Fou:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fou...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He turned around and scurried off...


---

**Mash:**
Mash Kyrielight, reporting for duty!

**Mash:**
This is&mdash;what is going on, Master?

**Goredolf:**
Hmph. There's no point in asking Fujimaru, Kyrielight.

**Goredolf:**
Myself and Holmes just arrived and we don't even know anything! There's no sign of the technical advisor or Captain either!

**Goredolf:**
And then there's that smug alchemist over there...

**Holmes:**
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm glad you all slept well last night.

**Holmes:**
The Director, Fujimaru, and Miss Kyrielight appear well rested.

**Holmes:**
Let's first go through the prerequisites, shall we, Miss Sion?

**Sion:**
That's right. Everyone, I'm glad you're all in good health.

**Sion:**
Fujimaru, the field researcher; Mash, demi-servant.

**Sion:**
Meunière, the helmsman; Tomlin, first operator.

**Sion:**
Kawata, second operato; Octavia, da Vinci's assistant.

**Sion:**
Chin, vehicle maintenance; Cayenne, weapons design and maintenance; Elron, records clerk; Marcus, Spiritron Engineering maintenance.

**Sion:**
And Goredolf, taster of honey-filled pancakes in the dining room this morning.

**Sion:**
Everyone seem to have remained calm and collected despite the situation. As expected of Chaldea's staff, who have weathered many battles!

**Sion:**
In that case, I can inform you of the current situation without hesitation. Oh, it's nothing to worry about at all!

**Goredolf:**
See, I have a rather bad feeling about this whole state of affairs, but I'll ask anyway! What's going on, Sion!?

**Goredolf:**
What does this ever-so-alarming red beacon signify?

**Goredolf:**
I don't know, perhaps there's a fire in the kitchen?

**Sion:**
No no, it's just that the Earth's in a bit of a pinch. At this rate, in 24 hours, we'll all be dead.

**Goredolf:**
Oh, total extinction. That's a bit bigger of a problem than I expe&mdash;

**Goredolf:**
Wait, what are you saying, you kneesock-wearing Egyptian!?

**Sion:**
Hmph, I take issue with you boiling me down to appearance, clothes, and nationality...

**Mash:**
I agree, but for now, I think we should discuss the topic at hand.

**Mash:**
New Director Gordolf, Fujimaru, and the rest of the staff are all a bit shaken.

**Mash:**
You mentioned the Earth is in trouble, but what exactly is happening?

**Sion:**
Excuse me, you're right. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll get straight to the point.

**Sion:**
It's been three weeks since the shock of the operation to destroy Alter Ego Limbo.

**Sion:**
Novum Chaldea has recently completed maintenance on the Storm Border, and has been devising a strategy to attack the remaining sixth and seventh Lostbelts.

**Sion:**
As I've explained before, the sixth Lostbelt—Great Britain—doesn't need to be attacked.

**Sion:**
Our priority was the seventh Lostbelt, where the “Alien God” is believed to be hiding.

**Goredolf:**
Uh, umm, I'm aware of that. We can leave the sixth Lostbelt alone. That's because&mdash;

**Goredolf:**
Come on, Fujimaru, let's hear it.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Britain doesn't have a Fantasy Tree anymore.|

**Holmes:**
Yes, the Fantasy Tree which had established the British Lostbelt was used to burn down the Fantasy Tree in Olympus.

**Holmes:**
In fact, no magical energy reactions specific to the Fantasy Trees have been observed from Britain.

**Holmes:**
The British Lostbelt will slowly vanish, just like the Chinese Lostbelt did.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Britain's in a bit of a dire state.

**Meunière:**
Hey, are you still half asleep, Fujimaru?

**Meunière:**
Since Britain's in such a bad state, we were going to leave it until we finished our other business.

**Meunière:**
Beryl Gut said as much, right?

**Meunière:**
In order to burn the Fantasy Tree of Olympus, he burned the Fantasy Tree of Britain.


---

**Mash:**
Yes. Although the Lostbelt remains surrounded by a wall of light,

**Mash:**
it's no longer a threat to pan-human history. That's been the consensus...right?

**Sion:**
Yes. It's been a subject of our investigations, but we did not consider it a threat.

**Sion:**
Until today, this very moment.

**Sion:**
This is a map of the planet's surface taken with observation by the Paper Moon, and predictive outcomes from the observational lens SHEBA.

**Sion:**
The British Lostbelt will vanish in 24 hours. With it, a wave of destruction will spread across the Earth like a tsunami.

**Sion:**
The planet will reach the end of its lifespan, and become unable to withstand its own gravitational pull. It will collapse into nothingness.

**Sion:**
This isn't like the pseudo-black hole used by the Alien God. This is a proper death of a planet.

**Sion:**
It's a “dead end for humanity”, one that will supersede the “bad end for humanity” that wiped Earth clean.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
H-how the hell did that happen!?|


---

**Holmes:**
The cause is unknown. However, now that we know the outcome, we can't afford to stand idle.

**Holmes:**
Both da Vinci and Captain Nemo are already beginning preparations to launch the Storm Border.

**Holmes:**
Up to now we've been using the Shadow Border to transfer into the Lostbelts by means of Imaginary Numbers space.

**Holmes:**
We aren't prepared for that this time. But, we do have the Storm Border.

**Holmes:**
The Storm Border is able to break through the barrier surrounding the Lostbelt.

**Holmes:**
As a large ship, it will be our frontline base, so to speak.

**Holmes:**
Even though the Shadow Border will be doing the on-site investigation, having a base that can supply us at any time is reassuring.

**Holmes:**
Also, TRISMEGISTUS II has defined this phenomenon as a “collapse.”

**Holmes:**
Or perhaps you could call it a “pitfall.”

**Mash:**
Pitfall...you mean Britain is going to sink or submerge?

**Holmes:**
We won't know for sure until we arrive there.

**Holmes:**
I dare say that this is a development that even the “Alien God” did not forsee.

**Holmes:**
The disappearance of the British Lostbelt is, by all means, a good thing. It's the natural consequence of the Fantasy Tree losing its power.

**Holmes:**
And yet, why should this “disappearance” continue to spread over the entire planet? If we don't solve this mystery, there's no future for us.

**Holmes:**
There is nothing we can do to fix the blank state of the Earth if the foundation itself disappears.

**Meunière:**
You said there's nothing we can do about it. We only have 24 hours left! There's nothing that can be accomplished in that time!

**Sion:**
Don't worry about that. The disappearance of Britain takes place in 24 hours in our time.

**Sion:**
But, according to SHEBA, the flow of time seems to be different inside those walls.

**Sion:**
Once you enter the Lostbelt, you don't need to take that countdown into consideration.

**Sion:**
After that, you just have to resolve this phenomenon inside Britain's Lostbelt!

**Sion:**
Nevertheless, it's true we don't have much time.

**Sion:**
From hereon out, all of Chaldea's staff will embark on the Storm Border.

**Sion:**
After the final safety checks, we will set sail for the British Isles.

**Sion:**
As soon as you arrive at the Wall of Light, break through with the Storm Border's dimensional boring equipment.

**Sion:**
Infiltrate the sixth Lostbelt, Britain.

**Sion:**
That concludes the explanation. The Shadow Border has just entered the dock.

**Sion:**
It's a sudden operation, but you can get any further details from da Vinci once on the Storm.

**Sion:**
Everyone, please be careful. I expect another fun story when you come back this time too.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Eh?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about you, Sion?


---

**Sion:**
Haha, sorry, sorry. I did say “all staff,” didn't I?

**Sion:**
That was a slip of the tongue. Cut, cut, that's a wrap!

**Sion:**
I thought it would be impudent to call a newcomer like me part of Chaldea's staff.

**Sion:**
Don't worry about me. I'll be continuing to observe the seventh Lostbelt from here.

**Sion:**
I'll do what I do best. You do what you do best, Fujimaru.

**Sion:**
However, if you fail, this entire base will be up in smoke in 24 hours!

**Sion:**
So please, try your hardest, and do the best you possibly can this time!

**Sion:**
Not that I'm worried, of course!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks! You too, Sion, stay strong!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yes, I got it!


---

**Nemo:**
All crew members are hereby notified. Repeat. All hands on deck.

**Nemo:**
Two hours after we set sail from the Wandering Sea, the ship has arrived in the waters surrounding the British Lostbelt, as scheduled.

**Nemo:**
We are now 200 kilometers north of the British Isles. The Wall of Light that you can see now is a dimensional faultline.

**Nemo:**
It is similar to the “End of the World” recorded in the sixth singularity.

**Nemo:**
Analysis by both da Vinci and Nemo Professor has revealed that the dimensional boundary to the south of Britain is relatively thin.

**Nemo:**
Therefore, this ship will take a large detour around the Wall of Light. Once we arrive at the southern part of Great Britain, dimensional drilling will commence.

**Nemo:**
The mission is scheduled to begin in 45 minutes. All crew members are to remain at their stations.

**Nemo:**
&mdash;Well then. As you heard, the operation will start without pause.

**Nemo:**
The Storm Border is a large ship.

**Nemo:**
It can't dive into Imaginary Number Space as easily as the Shadow Border could.

**Nemo:**
Instead, it can overcome the dimensional friction that separates worlds from each other, using its immense propulsion and strong magical barriers.

**Nemo:**
It's a giant drill. We'll use the Storm Border itself as a bullet to pierce through the Wall of Light.

**Nemo:**
Once we enter, the turbulence will be similar to use of the Zero Sail. Everyone should remain calm.

**Nemo:**
If you fall into a state of confusion, agitation, or panic, your soul will become unable to accompany your body.

**Goredolf:**
R-right, I got it. It's that thing that makes your head and chest feel awful.

**Goredolf:**
We're used to the Zero Sail by now. There's no point worrying, Captain.

**Goredolf:**
More importantly...

**Goredolf:**
Uh, do we have a plan?

**Goredolf:**
I don't even want to think about entering the Lostbelt without any countermeasures or milestones!

**Da Vinci:**
Of course. I know exactly what we have to do, so you can relax.

**Da Vinci:**
After all, I was brimming with energy to assault the British Lostbelt from the very beginning!

**Mash:**
Is that so?

**Mash:**
We were told the British Lostbelt was no longer a threat...

**Holmes:**
Indeed, but we still advanced with our plans to explore it.

**Holmes:**
We have only fragmentary information, but we know about Beryl Gut, one of the two remaining Crypters, who is in charge of the British Lostbelt, and...

**Holmes:**
About the Lostbelt King who attacked Olympus' Fantasy Tree.

**Holmes:**
What's more, this Lostbelt King also burned down the Fantasy Tree necessary for the survival of their own Lostbelt.

**Holmes:**
It's unknown if they were deceived by Beryl Gut, or if this was by mutual consent.

**Holmes:**
The important thing is they possess “substantial power, enough to burn down a Fantasy Tree.”  Which means&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rhongomyniad... right?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yes. Strong magic akin to divine judgement, able to reach a place as far removed as Olympus.

**Da Vinci:**
A mystery that exceeds Kirschtaria's ideal magic. That was without a doubt Rhongomyniad.

**Da Vinci:**
Something not made by the hands of men, but magecraft woven in the inner sea of the planet.

**Da Vinci:**
The trump card against the Alien God that we desperately need.

**Mash:**
The Inner Sea of the Planet? What is that...?

**Meunière:**
It's a legend of paradise...

**Meunière:**
Every legend talks about a “sanctuary that promises immortality.”

**Meunière:**
Utopia. The Garden of Eden. Tír na nÓg. In Britain, they call it Avalon.

**Meunière:**
A paradise not of this world that can't be reached by ordinary means.

**Meunière:**
It's said that it's inside the planet, the place where the planet's soul slumbers.

**Meunière:**
It's a story that mages of the Clock Tower know as trivia.

**Meunière:**
I called it a legend, but it's not a legend to those who can see it.

**Meunière:**
If one person was able to reach the Inner Sea of the Planet, then you might be able to as well. In fact, there is a group that researches that sort of thing in the Clock Tower.

**Meunière:**
Well...it's a place that exists completely outside human knowledge.

**Meunière:**
When someone is involved in a thing like that, it's like they wander into a different world.

**Goredolf:**
Hahaha, what are you talking about, Meunière? Could you be referring to the underground workshop?

**Goredolf:**
That stuff is just an exaggeration. They're merely an archaeological excavation team.

**Goredolf:**
Underneath the Clock Tower&mdash;underneath London, is the Navel of the World. Don't take it so lightly.

**Goredolf:**
Even if I were a supreme mage, I'd be too ashamed to run my mouth about it like that.

**Holmes:**
Ahem, can we return to the point at hand? Apart from the inner workings of the Mage Association and the Clock Tower,

**Holmes:**
if the King of the British Lostbelt is operating Rhongomyniad, I want to investigate and uncover this power.

**Holmes:**
We advanced with our plans to investigate Britain's Lostbelt for that very purpose.

**Holmes:**
The current situation is unexpected, but we had planned to invade it sooner or later.

**Mash:**
So, Master's mission this time is more than just on-site investigation...

**Holmes:**
Of course, there's also the matter of investigating and resolving the “collapse” that TRISMEGISTUS II warned of...

**Holmes:**
The most important thing is to secure Rhongomyniad. Our objective this time is to negotiate with the Lostbelt King.

**Goredolf:**
Negotiating with the Lostbelt King...you mean cutting a deal!? With the guy who shot ICBMs at us!?

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Even I think this is reckless. I'd really love to have Rhongomyniad, though...

**Da Vinci:**
We have the Storm Border, the Heroic Spirit system, and the Black Barrel.

**Da Vinci:**
When it comes to the immediate situation of the planet, and seeking the means to neutralize the Earth Presid—sorry, the Alien God,

**Da Vinci:**
Sion refuses to give up, saying that “the Divine Construct is necessary.”

**Holmes:**
Miss Sion is an alchemist of Atlas. She must have some distinct basis for that.

**Holmes:**
As she had calculated, we received the Nautilus, and now the Storm Border.

**Holmes:**
Let's follow her prediction this time as well.

**Holmes:**
We'll get our hands on Rhongomyniad, or whatever has replaced it.

**Da Vinci:**
Aww, isn't this a little too optimistic for you, Holmes?

**Da Vinci:**
The burden on Fujimaru might be unprecedented, don't you think?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...(I have a lot of work to do...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...(Yeah, it's a bit different this time...)


---

**Nemo:**
&mdash;That's enough chit-chat. Everyone, return to your stations.

**Nemo:**
We will reach the drilling point soon. Please prepare for the impact of space-time crossing.

**Mash:**
Y-yes! I'm very sorry, Captain!

**Meunière:**
Oh shoot, the wall is right in front of us! I'm ashamed of my carelessness, Captain!

**Goredolf:**
R-right, I got it! I still don't really understand, but I get the objective!

**Goredolf:**
Don't think of this as the same old Lostbelt, Fujimaru!

**Goredolf:**
Use your head if you negotiate! Cut your usual recklessness down to a third!

**Holmes:**
My, my. Director Gordolf beat me to it.

**Holmes:**
The essentials were said, but it would be good to get as many weapons as possible.

**Holmes:**
We have the wisdom and time, no matter who our opponent is.

**Holmes:**
So long as you take it one step at a time, you'll always arrive at the truth.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fujimaru, taking my seat!|


---

**Nemo:**
Good. Professor, begin the final checks. Storm Border, commence Zero Coating.

**Nemo:**
Triton Engines 1, 2, and 3, parallel operations all green. Calculating the time differential of the drilling target, complete.

**Nemo:**
I'm entrusting the protection of the armor to Da Vinci in the computer room. We of the Nemo Series will be focusing our attention on maintaining our course.

**Meunière:**
We've got acknowledgement from the computer room, Captain! Chances of success, 99.99%!

**Nemo:**
Dimensional boundary piercing warship Storm Border, launch! From hereon, we storm the sixth Lostbelt!

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did...did I just fall asleep?|


---

**Mash:**
Yes...I felt like I was in a coma...how is everyone else?

**Meunière:**
The same...a little dizzy, you know? Ah, damn it, I'm still feeling lightheaded...

**Goredolf:**
Hmm...“We've broken through the light barrier!”  I remember Captain's gallant words, but after that...

**Goredolf:**
I can't remember what happened...but more importantly, who turned off the lights!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Captain...?|

**Nemo:**
Thank you, I'm here. But...I'm sorry, it's difficult for me to talk right now...

**Holmes:**
Captain Nemo as well, then...apparently, I'm not the only one in a bit of a state...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Holmes?

**Holmes:**
Rest assured, I'm still in my seat. However...

**Holmes:**
If you ask me how I'm feeling, I would have to say: not great. My consciousness and body are as heavy as lead.

**Holmes:**
I wonder if this is what they call a “hangover”?

**Nemo:**
Holmes, it's the same here. I say, it's like the symptoms of a severe cold.

**Nemo:**
The Marines have all collapsed and the Nurses are now carrying them to the infirmary.

**Nemo:**
Neither Nemo Engine nor Nemo Bakery can remain conscious.


---

**Mash:**
Oh, no...why is this happening?

**Da Vinci:**
I'll explain it!

**Nemo:**
Da Vinci...? You're okay?

**Da Vinci:**
Why, of course! As you can see, da Vinci is always in good spirits!

**Da Vinci:**
I was lucky to remain in sync with the Border in the computer room.

**Da Vinci:**
While you were all unconscious, I did a full analysis of the situation inside the ship and the atmospheric conditions outside.

**Da Vinci:**
How much do you want me to explain? After all, Nemo and Holmes aren't exactly in tip-top shape right now.

**Holmes:**
No, it's fine. As long as you and Miss Kyrielight are in good health, we have our answer.

**Holmes:**
The same as the Chinese Lostbelt, right? As soon as we entered Britain, Nemo and myself fell into a slump.

**Holmes:**
“Heroic Spirits” cannot function in this Lostbelt.

**Holmes:**
Or, to be more precise, “Heroic Spirits originating from human history”...in other words, “human history” itself doesn't exist here, correct?

**Da Vinci:**
You're sharp. Nothing less from you, Holmes.

**Da Vinci:**
I've just checked, and all of the Saint Graphs we had moved to the Border are in a dormant state.

**Da Vinci:**
There is no foundation for the existence of “Heroic Spirits from pan-human history” in this Lostbelt.

**Da Vinci:**
The Chinese Lostbelt was a place where “heroes” weren't necessary, but...

**Da Vinci:**
This version of Britain is probably a “history where heroes never existed”. That's why the Heroic Spirits of pan-human history can't set foot on the British Isles.

**Da Vinci:**
They're “nonexistent” to begin with. Like being rejected by the world itself.

**Goredolf:**
Uh-huh. So, in short, there is no sufficient foundation for the Heroic Spirits to be active?

**Goredolf:**
For instance...say, Robin Hood. That Heroic Spirit should be able to exist in any Lostbelt.

**Goredolf:**
He's a faceless man that exists as long as there's something that corresponds to a “human who is skilled with a bow, regardless of identity or background.”

**Goredolf:**
But are you saying that even such easy conditions can't be met in this Lostbelt?

**Da Vinci:**
Yes, that's right. Thank you for the good analogy, Gordolf!

**Goredolf:**
No no, I remain a solitary director who has enjoyed reading your reports.

**Goredolf:**
You might even say that with just my knowledge, I surpass Fujimaru as a Lostbelt Master.

**Goredolf:**
But I see, this is a history that doesn't even include the concept of “people being good at archery”...

**Goredolf:**
What's the meaning of this?

**Goredolf:**
Even in a Lostbelt that continues to exist beyond the year 2017? Can such a human history exist?

**Holmes:**
It's not possible... Even if it is a Lostbelt, as long as it's still human history, it will follow a certain pattern.

**Holmes:**
As long as you build a civilization in the human format, there will always be technical breakthroughs to be made.

**Holmes:**
The way we breed animals, and thrive from it... if our culture and living standards don't reach a certain level,

**Holmes:**
we cannot survive for more than 10,000 years. Naturally, the many responsibilities of an occupation will eventually be divided, and thus, optimized.

**Holmes:**
Even if the titles are different, swordsmen, archers, spearmen, craftsmen, soldiers, kings, and detectives are born.

**Holmes:**
The lack of such means&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There are no "humans" here...?|

**Holmes:**
Good insight, Fujimaru. That is indeed the simplest conclusion.

**Holmes:**
However, there are other possibilities. I'll leave this discussion for later.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...


---

**Goredolf:**
But the technical advisor and Mash weren't even affected in the slightest!

**Mash:**
It's...because I'm a demi-servant, isn't it?

**Mash:**
My Saint Graph is that of the Heroic Spirit Galahad, but I'm not actually him...

**Da Vinci:**
Yes, exactly. And I'm not Leonardo da Vinci himself, either. Technically speaking, I'm a homunculus.

**Da Vinci:**
Well, I'm even more of a genius than he is! We should consider ourselves lucky!

**Nemo:**
...

**Nemo:**
Then, in other words, you and Mash are the only Servants who can operate in this Lostbelt.

**Meunière:**
Seriously!? You mean we can't even summon a new servant here!?

**Nemo:**
Since the Lostbelt rejects the concept of “heroes of human history”, we can't expect to increase our forces here.

**Nemo:**
If we want to increase our strength, we'll have to ask for help from the locals of this Lostbelt.

**Nemo:**
Most importantly...Da Vinci. Can you tell me, what has been going on for the last half hour?

**Da Vinci:**
Oh. Immediately after the Storm Border went through the Wall of Light, the systems went down.

**Da Vinci:**
All electronic equipment stopped functioning for unknown reasons, and the Storm Border crashed.

**Da Vinci:**
Nemo Engine underwent a last ditch effort to get a single Triton engine running again.

**Da Vinci:**
The Storm Border managed to break free from the island's airspace, and crash landed somewhere off the southwest coast.

**Da Vinci:**
So that's where we're at. The generator's down, too, so we're running on backup power for now.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's why it was dark...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's a tough situation...


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yup. The situation isn't great, to say the least. But hey, we're used to it by now, right?

**Da Vinci:**
We're just lucky there hasn't been any attack from the outside. At least we can relax a bit and take the time to discuss our plans.

**Holmes:**
Ah, no outside attack.

**Holmes:**
So, the Lostbelt King is unaware of our intrusion?

**Da Vinci:**
I can't say for sure, but it's possible. We haven't even landed on the island itself yet.

**Da Vinci:**
The Storm Border was stuttering more and more as we approached the island.

**Da Vinci:**
But this time...it just “stopped”. Nothing has been damaged or destroyed.

**Da Vinci:**
It's speculation, but the engines should be back to functioning properly as soon as we head away from the island.

**Nemo:**
Even though it's based on the Nautilus, it still can't get close to the “Island of Mystery”.

**Nemo:**
Anyway, I'm ashamed to admit it, but making sure that the Storm Border was safe was the first thing on my mind.

**Nemo:**
If we can restart the engines after heading away from the island, we have an escape route out of this Lostbelt.

**Nemo:**
The rest is something to worry about later&mdash;Da Vinci, will the Shadow Border work?

**Da Vinci:**
That's no good either. We can use it as a boat to get to the shore, but it'll stop functioning once it lands.

**Meunière:**
Seriously...we can't even use the Shadow Border...

**Meunière:**
Oh, and what about our communications? Is there any chance of wireless communication on the island?

**Da Vinci:**
It's hard to say until we try. But at this rate, we shouldn't get our hopes up.

**Da Vinci:**
In the worst case scenario, we'll have to revert back to primitive means of communication. Holmes, have you ever used a carrier pigeon?

**Holmes:**
I've only ever solved a few cases involving them. Of course, it could be useful.

**Da Vinci:**
Yes. Then I'll be your teacher this time, Holmes. Leave the correspondence to me.

**Da Vinci:**
And let's be clear about how much time we have left.

**Da Vinci:**
The Storm Border can stay in this state for approximately 30 days.

**Da Vinci:**
50 days if we cut back by reducing what we're powering on the ship. That would involve cutting off the backup power supply.

**Da Vinci:**
That's the time limit for this operation.

**Da Vinci:**
As soon as we're done, we'll move the Storm Border away from the British Isles and restart the engines.

**Da Vinci:**
Once the Triton Engine's magical energy stabilizes, we'll break through the Wall of Light again and leave the British Lostbelt.

**Da Vinci:**
I've prepared the briefing regarding our current plan. New Director Gordolf, if you would.

**Goredolf:**
Umm, as long as the Storm Border keeps away from the island, there's only one policy.

**Goredolf:**
Fujimaru makes landfall secretly on the Island of Britain with Mash Kyrielight as {(M) his /(F) her} escort.

**Goredolf:**
While investigating the area, they will look for the cause of the Collapse observed in Novum Chaldea.

**Goredolf:**
At the same time, if possible, contact the Lostbelt King and obtain Rhongomyniad.

**Goredolf:**
Contact with the Storm Border may be too difficult during the operation.

**Goredolf:**
Each of you will make your own decisions on the ground and return alive, with results, within 40... no, make it 45 days.

**Meunière:**
Just Fujimaru and Mash? You can't do that!

**Meunière:**
At least let me or Chin go with them! I mean, I'm scared too, but come on!

**Goredolf:**
Idiot, how is Mash going to defend you both?

**Goredolf:**
Mash Kyrielight is not the panacea! If there's only one servant present,

**Goredolf:**
I'm going to need that servant to support Fujimaru!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
New Director Gordolf...|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Papa Gordolf...

**Goredolf:**
I'm not your papa! I'm only in my twenties, you know!


---

**Goredolf:**
All right, you two! If you are ready, recite the mission statement!

**Mash:**
Roger! Mash Kyrielight, I will assist Master in surveying the area!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash and I will do our best!|


---

**Goredolf:**
Hmm. Well then, let's get to work. After all, there's a 45-day limit.

**Goredolf:**
Great Britain is large. If it were up to me, I would head to Oxford first...

**Goredolf:**
What are you doing, Technical Advisor!?

**Goredolf:**
It looks like she's packing things into her own backpack...

**Da Vinci:**
Hm? What, because I'm going with them on this little field trip?

**Da Vinci:**
I told you, leave the back-and-forth to me, right?

**Da Vinci:**
I'll write you all letters and send them to the Storm Border via familiar, thank you very much~☆

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wh&mdash;|


---

**Goredolf:**
What the hell&mdash;!?

**--ARROW--:**

**Goredolf:**
Hmm, mm, mmm...! That...that makes sense...!

**Goredolf:**
Ngh, rrrrgh...there's no way around it... I will allow the technical advisor to accompany them!

**Nemo:**
Fine...I'll take you as far as the coast. Take care of them for me, da Vinci.

**Da Vinci:**
And with that, we've finally landed in Britain~~!

**Da Vinci:**
It's really, really foggy! And yet, it's sooo warm!

**Nemo:**
Please, there is no need to get so excited.

**Nemo:**
We've conquered five Lostbelts so far. Mysterious lands are to be expected at this point.

**Da Vinci:**
Hey, it's like my first adventure. It's only natural that I'm getting fired up!

**Da Vinci:**
So, Captain's heading back to the Storm Border. You think you're pushing yourself too hard?

**Da Vinci:**
From hereon out, it's up to us, the field research team! We've been waiting with bated breath for this moment!

**Nemo:**
Good grief...well, if she's that energetic, I suppose there is no need to worry.

**Nemo:**
Fujimaru, Mash. While on your mission, please take good care of da Vinci.

**Nemo:**
Earlier, before I fell unconscious in the control room, I caught a short glimpse of the state of affairs in Britain.

**Nemo:**
The location due east of this beach was shrouded in fog, but there was what looked like a city beyond it.

**Nemo:**
It's about two hundred kilometers away. If everything goes smoothly, you will be able to reach it in a few days.

**Nemo:**
That is where you should be headed. I'm worried about this fog, but there's not much you can do to avoid it...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry. I'll be careful.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're always cautious.


---

**Nemo:**
Indeed. Then good luck, Fujimaru, Mash, da Vinci.

**Nemo:**
I'm looking forward to hearing good news.

**Mash:**
Equipment check complete, Master. Survival kit, and 90 days of portable rations, all in one piece.

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, yeah. As long as I have magical energy I won't go hungry, so you only need enough food for the two of you.

**Da Vinci:**
Huh? Now that I think of it, where's Fou?

**Da Vinci:**
He's not following either of you.

**Mash:**
You see...this time, Fou wasn't with us on the Storm Border.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's like he ran away and hid.|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Really? Feels a bit lonely, doesn't it? Wasn't Fou with you on your journey to restore humanity?

**Da Vinci:**
I was hoping for a similar experience that my adult self once had... Fou, do you not like Britain?

**Da Vinci:**
Well, it can't be helped. I'm sure there will be future opportunities for us to travel together.

**Mash:**
Of course. At such a time, Holmes, New Director Gordolf,

**Mash:**
Sion, Meunière, and Fou, we'll all go on an adventure!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right. Let's go!|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah! To the city 200 kilometers east of here! Or something like that!

**Da Vinci:**
It's a long path, so let's go, Ch-al-de-a!

**Tristan:**
Yes, it is good to keep motivated. After all, we have a long path ahead of us...or so I feel.

**Da Vinci & Mash:**
&mdash;Whaaaaat?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Huh?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
I can't believe it...what on earth...

**Da Vinci:**
It's only the start of my first adventure, and I'm already hallucinating...!?

**Mash:**
What a surprise...both Master and da Vinci can see him too...

**Mash:**
If it was just me...I could have passed it off as an optical illusion caused by how nervous I am, but...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Tristan, to say the least...|


---

**Tristan:**
My, what is with this hostile atmosphere? It saddens me...

**Tristan:**
Certainly, I may seem unremarkable, like a weather vane spinning in the wind...

**Tristan:**
It's true, it was a very automated, informal summoning, but...

**Mash:**
Oh! My apologies, the report! The Round Table shield has a trace of heat from a summon!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Speaking of, that familiar light near Mash just now...)|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Wait, really? It's not an illusion? It's&mdash;it's really a Saint Graph materializing!

**Da Vinci:**
It's the real Sir Tristan! But how!? A Heroic Spirit from pan-human history shouldn't be able to exist here!

**Tristan:**
Hmm...

**Tristan:**
Apparently I am not being criticized, but it appears my summoning was unexpected.

**Tristan:**
It was not by my own wish that I responded to the summons. When I came to my senses...I found myself in front of you.

**Tristan:**
Of course, as a Heroic Spirit on the side of humanity, I am aware of Chaldea, however...

**Tristan:**
I too am clueless as to the present situation. Please, could you explain it to me?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;And that's why.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Heroic Spirits can't be summoned. One was anyway. Clear?


---

**Tristan:**
I see. So this is the Lostbelt...the impossible Isle of Britain.

**Tristan:**
As for why the knight Tristan was able to be summoned here, well...

**Tristan:**
It is probably because this is the coast of Cornwall.

**Tristan:**
You could call it a bond with the land.

**Tristan:**
Even if history itself differs, the island itself should be the same.

**Mash:**
Oh&mdash;that's right.

**Mash:**
Sir Tristan is said to have been born in Cornwall, which is the southwest point of Britain.

**Mash:**
So, the summon was possible because...or, could the land itself have sought relief, do you think?

**Da Vinci:**
Or maybe, Fujimaru, anxious about stepping into an unknown land...

**Da Vinci:**
{(M) He /(F) She} subconsciously wished for someone to be summoned, or something.

**Da Vinci:**
Either way, it's reassuring that we have Sir Tristan with us. At the same time, it gives me hope!

**Da Vinci:**
Even if there are no “heroes of humanity” in this Lostbelt, if some connection can be made, it should be possible to summon the Heroic Spirits of pan-human history.

**Da Vinci:**
Sir Gawain of Orkney, for example. Or for that matter, King Arthur of Camelot himself!

**Tristan:**
Straight to King Arthur...? That's&mdash;

**Tristan:**
No, it would be a pleasure. As King, I am sure he would be able to help you.

**Tristan:**
Of course, I offer you my services, though I am of little help. Yet it is my duty as a Knight of the Round Table.

**Tristan:**
Master Fujimaru.

**Tristan:**
Although it was not a direct summon, I offer to you my Failnaught. Please use me to the fullest.

**Tristan:**
Tristan the Lamenting, I will be your servant.

**Tristan:**
Then, I'll lead the way.

**Tristan:**
If there is something you aspire to attain in southwest Britain, I shall be your guide.

**Tristan:**
From this area, you can cross those mountains, and soon you will be in the hills.

**Tristan:**
We can be on the road in about two hours. Let's go, Master.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. Good to meet you, Tristan!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The ever-reliable Sir Tristan!


---

 ~One hour from the start of travel~

**Tristan:**
...

**Da Vinci:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|


---

**Mash:**
Sir...Sir Tristan...I hate to say it, but...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, maybe we're lo&mdash;|


---

**Tristan:**
<span style=font-size:25px>I'm not lost. </span>

**Tristan:**
Certainly...those of you that are dependent on your eyes may feel that way.

**Tristan:**
But, we are definitely making progress. We've already walked four kilometers. Progress is being made.

**Tristan:**
It's just a case of “no matter how far you go, you cannot escape the coast.”

**Tristan:**
If Sir Bedivere were here, I am sure he would say something like:

**Tristan:**
“Don't worry about it, Tristan! I'll lead the way from here, so you get some rest.”

**Tristan:**
And that is how we'd find an alternative route...

**Da Vinci:**
So you ARE lost! And Bedivere would be astonished, don't you think?

**Tristan:**
Yes...it's as I thought...Sir Bedivere would be dismayed...

**Tristan:**
It saddens me...if only you had put it so bluntly before, I would have played an encouraging song for you on my harp...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Even Bedi would hate that) It's a bad time.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But, it is strange...


---

**Tristan:**
That is for sure...maybe it is all this fog...

**Tristan:**
I have been placing bewitched string along our path to ensure we are not walking in circles...

**Tristan:**
Yet somehow, the strings...they have been broken... but, they were not cut...

**Tristan:**
I was letting go of the strings with my own hands...

**Tristan:**
It's as if...I've forgotten what I was thinking... just a minute ago...

**Tristan:**
&mdash;!

**Mash:**
...! Master, there's a high density of magical energy ahead!

**Mash:**
I don't know if it's a hostile species because I haven't received anything from the Border, but this is&mdash;

**Mash:**
Guh!

**Da Vinci:**
We're under attack! Prepare to intercept, Fujimaru!

**Da Vinci:**
This will be your first battle in the British Lostbelt, fight with the utmost caution!

**--BATTLE--:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;It vanished?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was defeated?


---

**Infant of a Rut:**
Eek, it's too strong~~! What on earth, a British ghost?

**Infant of a Rut:**
I managed to fight them off, but there was no response or reaction, so it doesn't feel like I've defeated them at all!

**Knight of Sorrows:**
I feel the same... What marvelous vitality.

**Knight of Sorrows:**
One cannot simply classify it as a ghost or similar... that strangeness...that deep secrecy...it's just...

**Knight of Sorrows:**
No...we should be appreciative of the toil we went through. Well done, Master.

**Knight of Sorrows:**
We can't summon any Heroic Spirits here in Britain... so I was worried.

**Knight of Sorrows:**
But a simple, temporary summoning...it seems both possible, and reliable...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I managed...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was more tiring than usual, though!


---

**Infant of a Rut:**
Yeah. I was watching from the sidelines, but you seemed to be using more magical energy than usual.

**Infant of a Rut:**
In your case, you're converting your own life force into magical energy, so you should avoid fighting as much as possible&mdash;

**Fairy Knight:**
Oh, no&mdash;

**Infant of a Rut:**
Mash? What's the matter?

**Fairy Knight:**
Black Barrel&mdash;no, the whole of Ortenaus&mdash;

**Fairy Knight:**
It&mdash;it's jammed&mdash;

**Infant of a Rut:**
Mash!? What's happening, Mash!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Da Vinci-chan...?


---

**Knight of Sorrows:**
What's with you two...? There's a presence nearby, but...

**Knight of Sorrows:**
No...it's moving away. We can't. We'll get separated in this fog.

**Knight of Sorrows:**
I'll call them back here. Your names, your names were...

**Knight of Sorrows:**
Your names are...

**Knight of Sorrows:**
No...to begin with, my name is&mdash;?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait for me, redhead...!|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Redhead...|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who are you...? No, more importantly...|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I...I am...who am I?|


---

**B：???:**
Oh no, no, no. Even though I was in a hurry, I've seemed to have arrived a little late.

**B：???:**
Huh? Because I've been taking it a little too easy? Come on, cut me some slack here.

**B：???:**
After all, this is the first time we've met. It's important to have good manners and make a good first impression.

**B：???:**
But, I wonder if {(M) he /(F) she} was also at fault here?

**B：???:**
After all, entering the Nameless Forest without a talisman is tantamount to suicide.

**B：???:**
{(M) He /(F) She}'s a Master of Chaldea. {(M) He /(F) She}'s awfully brave, don't you think, Blanca?

**Moth on ???'s Arm:**
&mdash;

**B：???:**
Do I trust strangers? Yes, I do. I would trust this one with all my heart.

**B：???:**
Well, I was a little bit skeptical until I saw them in person, but...

**B：???:**
I understand {(M) him /(F) her}. {(M) He /(F) She}'s genuine. Serious about saving the world, with such unrivaled passion.

**B：???:**
&mdash;Ahh, it was worth having faith and waiting for so long.

**Moth on ???'s Arm:**
&mdash;

**B：???:**
You're right, Blanca. It's time for me to get serious, too.

**B：???:**
Oops, are those fairies lurking in the shadows? One, two, three, four of them...oh dear, that's quite a bad omen.

**B：???:**
Thank goodness, they seem to be good-natured fairies. I'm sure they can help.

**B：???:**
Well then, I guess we'll save the emotional greetings for another time.

**B：???:**
Godspeed, child of Chaldea. Try to get acclimated to the air of Britain first.

**B：???:**
Oh, but one thing&mdash;

**B：???:**
Whatever you do, don't make the mistake of saying you're human, okay?

**--ARROW--:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash&mdash;|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maaaaash&mdash;!|


---

**A：???:**
Thank goodness. You've regained consciousness.

**A：???:**
You don't appear injured, so I don't think your life is in danger...

**A：???:**
Please, let me know if you have any pain anywhere.

**A：???:**
I'm still a novice, but I can do some basic treatment.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're&mdash;|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Mash?|


---

**Mash:**
Oh. Ah&ndash;yes, that's right. That was my name, wasn't it?

**Mash:**
No, I'm glad. I almost forgot my own name, so...

**Mash:**
I see. Mash, huh. It's an original, but short and sweet name.

**Mash:**
But, if you know my name, then you and I must have been friends, after all!

**Mash:**
Good morning, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. Do you know where we are?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where are we...? {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}...?|


---

**Mash:**
Uh...you're {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, right? It says so on your name tag.

**Mash:**
I heard that we collapsed in the “Nameless Forest”. Do you know anything about it?

**Mash:**
Once you enter, you get lost in the fog, and can't find your way out.

**Mash:**
You're lost, your memory gets more and more hazy, you start forgetting who you are. In the end, you lose your name, and your past...

**Mash:**
It's like a forest of no return. It's the worst Fairy Territory in Britain, but...

**Mash:**
How could we have ended up in such a place...

**Mash:**
I wonder if something bad happened...

**Mash:**
It's like if everyone ordered ginger ale, but I was the only one to get salt water, or something like that...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
{(M) Lysander... Lysander? /(F) Hermia... Hermia?}|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(No...I can't remember anything...!)


---

**Mash:**
{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia?} What's the matter, is something on your mind?

**Mash:**
Ah! Did you hit your head in the woods, by any chance? Is there serious damage to your skull!?

**B：???:**
No, that's not it. Perhaps, {(M) he /(F) she} doesn't know who {(M) he /(F) she} is...

**B：???:**
I very much doubt {(M) he /(F) she} can remember a single thing about you, about {(M) him /(F) her}self, about this place...

**B：???:**
After all, I am the same...

**B：???:**
All I remember, is that I was {(M) his /(F) her} follower...

**B：???:**
“I will defend my Lord even if it costs me my life”... that is the only thought that still keeps me standing.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're...no, I can't remember!|


---

**B：???:**
Take it easy, milord. As for me, I'm Isolde's lover... no, that's not it...

**B：???:**
Right, Tristram...my name, it must be Tristram...

**Tristram:**
See, I have a name tag made of leaves on my chest. It is written in Old English. (smug)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's true. I can't read it properly!|


---

**Tristram:**
Yes. So, you are {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. I'm Tristram. She's Mash.

**Tristram:**
Aha. Naturally, we are three travelling companions in distress together!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course, that's it!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Alright, high five!


---

**Mash:**
...? (What's Old English?)

**Mash:**
In other words, all of us have no idea who we are, or where we came from.

**Mash:**
But having something we had to accomplish,

**Mash:**
we entered the Nameless Forest knowing the danger... and that about sums it up.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I thought this was the coast, but guess we're in the woods.)|


---

**Tristram:**
Yes...the only other thing I can tell you, is that I am an outstanding genius among my people...

**Tristram:**
A poet and a superb archer with transcendent technique.

**Mash:**
I see. (In other words, you don't know anything.)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What about you, Mash?|


---

**Mash:**
W-well, it seems like I'm the same as you two. I get the sense I've forgotten many things.

**Mash:**
Anyway.

**Mash:**
We were found by the fairies of this village after we collapsed in the Nameless Forest.

**Mash:**
The next question is, why did they rescue us? Are they slavers now? Or something like that? I've heard of them...

**Mash:**
Ugh...I don't want to think about it, but if this is one of those villages...!

**C：???:**
Hello. Unconscious people, have you woken up?

**C：???:**
Aa&mdash;ah. Um, I heard your voices...I'm sorry if I startled you.

**C：???:**
Um...everybody wants me to come get all of you.

**C：???:**
Look, it's going to get dark soon so...before then, okay?

**Tristram:**
(...{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. Have you met her before?)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(No, never.)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I think this is the first time...)


---

**Tristram:**
(Is that so... I don't feel any hostility from her. A good person...no, no matter how you look at it...)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(A fairy straight out of a fairytale, right?)|


---

**C：???:**
Ah, er, um...

**C：???:**
Can you not move...? If so, we can always talk later...

**C：???:**
But if I do that, everyone will call me useless again...

**Mash:**
By 'everyone', you mean the fairies of this village?

**Mash:**
It's alright. We're just going to talk a little bit first, so please go on ahead.

**Mash:**
I will explain to the others that you called us.

**C：???:**
&mdash;!

**C：???:**
I-I was useful! Oh, thank you so much!

**C：???:**
We'll all gather in the square to wait for you!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She left...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Anyway, should we get going...?


---

**Mash:**
Hah... Let's go outside, shall we?

**Mash:**
I'm a little anxious, but it seems like things will only get worse if we stay cooped up in here.

**Mash:**
Well, no matter what they ask, we don't remember a thing,

**Mash:**
so we can't fall under any weird prejudices like what city we're from, or if we side with the Queen or not!

**Tristram:**
???

**Fairy-like Animal:**
Is that them!? The ones who were left for dead in the forest!

**Fairy-like Animal:**
Eww, they look like people, but they have no wings! The Wind Clan sure has fallen far, heeheehee!

**Fairy with a Friendly Face:**
Please don't lump them together with us. They're different from the ground up.

**Fairy with a Friendly Face:**
They're obviously convicts who were sentenced to having their wings torn off. Did they escape from Darlington?

**Petite Fairy:**
They're pale. Their limbs are like dead branches. What should we do?

**Fairy-like Animal:**
Well then, let's tear them apart! If we use their limbs for firewood, it'll brighten up the night!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;(Lost for words)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This is too much like a fairy tale...!)


---

**Fairy with a Friendly Face:**
Before that, let's hear their story. That's our “Rule”.

**Fairy with a Friendly Face:**
Which clan do you come from, and what are your names? Which city are you from?

**Fairy with a Friendly Face:**
For what reason did you decide to flee to Cornwall?

**Mash:**
No, it's just...we only know our own names.

**Mash:**
I don't know where I came from, why I'm here, what my purpose was, nothing...

**Fairy with a Friendly Face:**
&mdash;Huh!? You don't even know what city you're from?

**Petite Fairy:**
Tch. You don't even have a purpose, do you?

**Fairy-like Animal:**
Hah. Terrible. Awful. What is with that nonsense?

**Fairy-like Animal:**
I was hoping we could have ransomed her off. They'd have made a real fuss over someone like her.

**Fairy-like Animal:**
Everyone, these guys&mdash;

**Fairy with a Friendly Face:**
Yeah, this calls for&mdash;

**Petite Fairy:**
Ah, you mean&mdash;

**Fairy-like Animal:**
We'll have to take care of them ourselves! We found some new friends&mdash;!

**Fairies:**
Yippee&mdash;! Yahooo&mdash;! 

**Fairies:**
A festival, a festival! We found ourselves more friends!

**Fairies:**
Having no place to live, no purpose, nothing but a name!

**Fairies:**
They chase you, they stone you! You find yourselves at the end of the road!

**Fairies:**
In the “Nameless Forest”, you'll disappear by morning! Even queens run for their lives in there!

**Fairies:**
Welcome to Cornwall, the village at the end, my fellow countrymen!

**Fairies:**
It's been a rough journey so far, hasn't it? Haven't you suffered enough already?

**Fairies:**
Here, in the burning dregs of society, you can live out your lives carefree!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
S&mdash;|


---

**Mash:**
S-sure?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm full, I've eaten way too much...|


---

**Mash:**
The fairies of this village were so considerate to entertain us like this tonight!

**Mash:**
Also, you're a very good conversationalist. It's surprising.

**Mash:**
You were a bit confused at first, but eventually spoke to the Wind Clan and Earth Clan without distinction.

**Mash:**
Despite the fact that in the Fairy Kingdom, it's common practice to support one or the other.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Clans of Wind and Earth?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fairy Kingdom?


---

**Mash:**
Huh? You forgot that too? Really?

**Mash:**
Hmm...that's a nuisance. The only thing you forget in the Nameless Forest should be “yourself.”

**Mash:**
I've heard that you don't go as far as to forget your daily habits, but...

**Mash:**
What about you, Tristram? Do you know anything about the Fairy Kingdom?

**Tristram:**
...

**Mash:**
The same as {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, I see. Then let me teach you two.

**Mash:**
I don't know anything major, but I've been taught the basics&mdash;

**Halobaromia:**
Alright, everyone pipe down! The banquet is over!

**Halobaromia:**
I know how you feel, I know. But unfortunately, it's getting dark. Let's pick the welcome party back up tomorrow.

**Onfam:**
The fun times are short, huh? I guess that's it. Everyone, let's get back to our roofs.

**Doga:**
See you later, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, Mash! You too, tight-lipped Tristram!

**Doga:**
That roof is all yours! Keep yourselves hidden until morning!

**Halobaromia:**
You there, show our guests to their dwelling.

**Onfam:**
Be quick, the more you dawdle, the more wounds you'll get again.

**Doga:**
That's right. Don't get distracted and wander off, okay? No one's going to find you at night!

**???:**
Y-yes. I-I'll be fine. Thank you for trusting me with this.

**???:**
Everyone, I'm going to take you back to the roof from earlier. That will be your territory from now on.

**Mash:**
...?

**Tristram:**
...

**???:**
Th-then, good night.

**???:**
This place is separated from the village square, but you're still within the village's boundaries.

**???:**
The animals of the forest can't come in. You can rest easily.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(She just bowed her head and left...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(We forgot to ask that girl's name...)


---

**Mash:**
Alright. I think you may be tired from talking to so many fairies,

**Mash:**
but before we sleep, let's return to our conversation from earlier.

**Mash:**
You know that this Fairy Kingdom, Britain, is literally a land of fairies, correct?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh&mdash;sort of, yeah.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I had no idea, but I'll keep my mouth shut.)


---

**Mash:**
Good. Next is the types of fairies.

**Mash:**
Fairies are different creatures with their own characteristics, so we'd end up spending days going through them all.

**Mash:**
So for now, just remember the big clans.

**Mash:**
In the Fairy Kingdom, a “clan” is like an ethnic group.

**Mash:**
“Wind Clan,” “Earth Clan,” “Fang Clan,” “Wing Clan,”  “Mirror Clan,” “King's Clan.”

**Mash:**
That's all of them.

**Mash:**
The “Wind Clan” is a race that looks exactly like humans, like Halobaromir. A clan made of “people”, if you would.

**Mash:**
They're all peaceful and rational, and have excellent Fairy Patterns.

**Mash:**
The “Earth Clan” is a hardy and tight-knit race, like Onfam.

**Mash:**
Among the clans, they are the hardest-working. Their help is needed when constructing buildings and roads.

**Mash:**
The “Fang Clan” are like Doga, and live as one with the earth. No matter how you look at them, they're like a pack of wolves.

**Mash:**
They're belligerent, but actually very strong.

**Mash:**
It could be said that the fairies of this land have been able to survive up till now because the Fang Clan fought for them.

**Mash:**
There's also the “Wing Clan” and the “Mirror Clan,” but...

**Mash:**
I don't know much about the Wing Clan, since they're not talked about much...

**Mash:**
The Mirror Clan used to be the most numerous in the fairy lands, but a few years back their entire village vanished...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then what about the "King's Clan?"|


---

**Mash:**
&mdash;Mrgh. Do you really want to hear about them, {(M) Lyse /(F) Herm}?

**Mash:**
The King's Clan are a bunch of good-for-nothings! The cause of all discord, division, and conflict in Britain!

**Mash:**
There's only one in charge, yet she acts like a big shot and looks down on all the others!

**Mash:**
Talking about city life to a naive country girl just. Isn't. Done!

**Mash:**
That fancy dress! So many suck-ups! Grand plans for the future! Just die already!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash; (Speechless)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Sounds like a sore spot...)


---

**Mash:**
Sorry, I'm a little biased. Please forget all of that just now.

**Mash:**
The King's Clan's...head, is a bit of a special case. She has no peers.

**Mash:**
She'll welcome and protect the fairies who obey her as part of her Clan, but otherwise...

**Mash:**
Well, if we ever get the chance to meet her, you will understand too.

**Mash:**
Anyone who sees her would say,

**Mash:**
“W-what a horrible person. Just by looking at her, my future is ruined!”

**Mash:**
You can tell at a glance by her appearance and behavior.

**Mash:**
By the way...

**Mash:**
You've been acting strange for a while, Tristram. You seem rather nervous.

**Tristram:**
It's...yes, it is nerves. Actually, you could say I am frightened.

**Tristram:**
Ever since we went to the village square, there has been no time to relax.

**Tristram:**
To the two of you, they seem to be such frail creatures, but...

**Tristram:**
Simply because they are fairies, they are terrifying. I may have lost my memories, but I recall that much.

**Tristram:**
Even that fairy girl who led us here possesses some degree of Mystery...

**Tristram:**
They may seem harmless, but their power far surpasses our own.

**Tristram:**
If they so desired, the fairies of this village could easily kill us...

**Tristram:**
So, please don't forget that...it is rather terrifying...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|


---

**Mash:**
...

**Mash:**
Apparently Tristram was in the military.

**Mash:**
I can't wrap my head around the idea of fairies fighting each other.

**Mash:**
Enforcing the queen's demands...

**Mash:**
Aside from the fairies employed in the castle, I heard that fairies solve all their disputes through discussion.

**Mash:**
Well, maybe there are some rule breakers among them that just lack common sense.

**Mash:**
But there didn't seem to be any fairies who disliked us in the square earlier.

**Tristram:**
I certainly didn't sense any hostility from them, but...

**Mash:**
Yes, there's no danger. They're all outstandingly ordinary fairies&mdash;oh?

**Voice from Outside:**
 Be at ease, be at ease. The prayer is over, close your eyes.

 The time for fun is over. Put down your books and dim your lights.

 Goodbye today, the today which has come to an end. Once and forever, today has ended.

 Forgive us, forgive us. Forgive us our sins, for we will forgive you your sins.

 It's all in the past anyway. Just be sure to clean up!

**Mash:**
Looks like it's time for lights out. Let's continue this discussion later, shall we?

**Mash:**
We've been so generously welcomed. Let's not do anything that would displease them.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're right. I'm so full.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is that alright with you, Tristram?


---

**Tristram:**
... (nods silently)

**Mash:**
Let's see, is this the light? Oh wow, it's a glass lamp!

**Mash:**
Could it be that someone from the Earth Clan in Norwich washed up here? I'll try and talk to them tomorrow!

**Mash:**
Well, good night, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, Tristram.

**Mash:**
I was concerned what would happen when you woke up, but thankfully you're both so honest and friendly!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Me too.|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good night, Ma

**Mash:**
Ma? Why did you cut off the name?

**Mash:**
...? You just couldn't bring yourself to say it, could you?

**Mash:**
That's&mdash;I see. I'm sure it was a very important name to you.

**Mash:**
It happens, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. Well, good night.


---

**--ARROW--:**

**???:**
G-good morning, everyone. Today, I-I've been assigned to show you around the village.

**???:**
That said, it doesn't cover much area. So this will not take long.

**???:**
It seems that Cornwall was built over an older village.

**???:**
Two hundred years ago, after the Fairy Knights overthrew the fairy lord of Cornwall,

**???:**
the lord's curse brought about the mist that causes those who enter the forest to lose their memories.

**???:**
It shrouded the area, and the village was abandoned.

**???:**
After that, even Her Majesty couldn't touch it, and it became the most dangerous area in Britain.

**???:**
Nobody comes after us here. It's like a penal colony.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's a Fairy Knight?|

**???:**
Ahaha, are you serious? A Fairy Knight is a Fairy Knight, you know? Hehe, you're a funny one.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
By penal colony...is everyone here a criminal...?

**???:**
No, it's not quite like that, but...


---

**???:**
This is the Territory of fairies who have become “hated.”

**???:**
Those whose role has ended. Those who are less valuable. Those with no friends. Those who lost their purpose.

**???:**
It's a small gathering of fairies who trickle here after finishing their destinies...

**???:**
Everyone here has a kind heart. Fairies who would rather cooperate than compete with one another.

**???:**
But...that's no way to live in Her Majesty's Britain, so...

**???:**
Because it's easier to die than to be laughed at, shunned, or robbed by your friends...

**???:**
I think everyone came to this forest because they just wanted everything to end...

**Mash:**
That's...

**Doga:**
Oh hey, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}! Last night was great!

**Doga:**
I like you, you seem like you enjoy good food! I'll get you some more today, alright?

**Halobaromia:**
Good day to you, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. There is life in your voice. It is like a spring breeze.

**Halobaromia:**
How about a verse today as well? I too will pick up the lyre for the first time in some time.

**Onfam:**
{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. If your clothes get torn, come see me.

**Onfam:**
I've still got some Norwich-made cloth left over. It'll look great if you wear it!

**Mash:**
(※Facial expression saying, “What's with this difference in treatment?”)

**Mash:**
Y-you're popular, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. I'm almost in the same boat as you, but...haha...

**Mash:**
I guess it's that...dignity you exude? I wonder... I'm indifferent to stuff like that...

**???:**
Is that so? I think you're wonderful too, Mash.

**???:**
{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia} has an air of freshness about {(M) him /(F) her}, and brings a positive atmosphere just by being here.

**???:**
Mash's aura feels warm and bright.

**???:**
It reminds me of peaceful times and makes me feel nostalgic.

**Mash:**
Hehe. That's true. I'll be honest, my only thing I have going for me is my cheerfulness!

**Mash:**
My creed is to smile no matter the circumstances! Thank you very much!

**???:**
Hehe. That's true, a smile is the best, isn't it?

**???:**
Well now, let's tour the village.

**???:**
If you know the boundaries of our Territory, you won't disappear by the end of the day.

**???:**
This is how far the village goes. Is there anything else you would like to ask?

**Mash:**
I assume the mists of the Nameless Forest don't enter the village. Is the surrounding fog deep?

**Mash:**
Also, if this used to be a village, are there any roads left that get to the middle of the country?

**???:**
Let me see...the fog doesn't get that bad as long as you stay away from the depths of the forest.

**???:**
But, as you might expect, you'll still get lost... and the road to the heartlands is even now overgrown with plants...

**Mash:**
I see...it seems some quick thinking is necessary to get out of the forest...

**???:**
Huh? Mash, do you and the others want to leave the forest?

**Mash:**
No? Not at all? For some reason I just considered it.

**Mash:**
Isn't that right, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}? After all, we came into the Nameless Forest willingly.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It seems that way, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I still don't understand anything...


---

**???:**
I see...but I was almost convinced.

**???:**
I had a feeling that you all were different from the fairies who usually come here.

**???:**
Perhaps you wandered in here by some mistake.

**???:**
Please, tell me if you require anything. All I can do is act as a guide, but...

**???:**
As long as nobody scolds me, I will stand by you all.

**Mash:**
Well...at any rate, I have a grasp of the topography of this village.

**Mash:**
Now that there are no more fairies accompanying us, let's get to it, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Get to what?


---

**Mash:**
Oh, don't play dumb! There's only one thing to do in this situation!

**Mash:**
Test our skills! We've forgotten everything but our names.

**Mash:**
What our limits are, what our best strategies are...

**Mash:**
Let's go out in the woods for a bit and try it out! Magecraft is power, so all we have to do is practice! Chop chop!

**--BATTLE--:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sorry I was so useless...|


---

**Mash:**
No no no, it's my fault...!

**Mash:**
It wasn't necessary for you to learn combat skills... meaning, you never had to fight yourself...

**Mash:**
{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, could you be the {(M) son /(F) daughter} of a clan head...!? H-how could I have been so careless...!?

**Mash:**
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, how rude of me...!

**Mash:**
I'll do better tomorrow, so please pretend this never happened...!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm the one who should apologize...|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sorry I couldn't fight before...


---

**Tristram:**
I hope you do not mind, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. On the contrary, I am quite convinced.

**Tristram:**
I cannot think of the reason, but I am convinced you are capable.

**Tristram:**
Last night, I was daunted by the sheer potential of the fairies. But that is not the case anymore.

**Tristram:**
I would say that you are a good leader. Like a coach in football.

**Tristram:**
If you are here, we will make it in the end. I am sure of that.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you, Isolde's lover...|


---

**Tristram:**
Heh&mdash;it's Tristram, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}.

**Mash:**
&mdash;.

**Doga:**
Yeah, they hate us!

**Doga:**
Unable to pay the annual “existence tax”, I fell out of favor with the Queen!

**Doga:**
Someday, I might join you in the forest, and choose to forget everything!

**Halobaromia:**
But, I'm not afraid.

**Halobaromia:**
Even if you're chased away from the cities, nothing changes in the end.

**Halobaromia:**
There's a Calamity on the horizon. The bell tolls for us all equally, no matter our status.

**Halobaromia:**
Only a few will survive. Those that do can choose where to live as they please.

**Onfam:**
We're fairies, part of the six clans, and we live for the festivals!

**Onfam:**
We're scared of the Queen, we're scared of the Mors, and most of all, we're scared of ourselves!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The chorus has begun...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's so... filling...


---

**Tristram:**
It is pleasant, is it not? The tempo is simple, but it is oddly energizing.

**Tristram:**
Is that all improvised? You seem very accustomed to it.

**Mash:**
Indeed. Joining together in a circle to celebrate is a reason to live for fairies.

**Mash:**
This is the only time the Wind and Earth Clans stop squabbling.

**Mash:**
That is, if they don't drink too much...

**Mash:**
There are fairies among them who get really drunk. I wonder if it's the atmosphere that does it?

**Onfam:**
What, you're not going to eat any more, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}? You just got here, no need to hold back.

**Onfam:**
Or was it such a painful journey? Hm? Your right hand...

**Onfam:**
They look odd, but are those Command Spells? To have three drawn on you... damn.

**Onfam:**
Just forget it. There's nobody here who will force you to do anything.

**Onfam:**
You've done your best up till now. You're a great {(M) fella /(F) gal} despite being so scrawny.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Huh...why am I...crying?)


---

**Onfam:**
Hey, what are you crying for, moron?

**Onfam:**
Come on, first get some rest until you're satisfied. When you get bored you can help me with the village chores.

**Tristram:**
You seem like a considerate fairy. But, Command Spells...Command Spells...

**Tristram:**
I am so close to recalling something but...aah, how vexing...

**Halobaromia:**
Alright, everyone pipe down~! The party is ending here~!

**Halobaromia:**
I'm not drunk, drunk I am definitely not. Therefore, I know exactly what time it is.

**Halobaromia:**
Let's get back to our homes before the beasts wake up.

**Halobaromia:**
We wouldn't know if you were eaten alive! Marm! Sania! Dunbarton!

**Halobaromia:**
The Wind Clan must get back before anyone else! As the most beautiful of the clans, we must maintain discipline!

**Doga:**
What!? You sure get cranky when you're drunk, Halobaromia!

**Doga:**
We'll be prepared at tomorrow's feast! See you, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}!

**Doga:**
Tomorrow, I'll show you to our playground! It's fun to play ball!

**Mash:**
Today's welcoming party has ended as well. At this rate though, it seems like it will pick up again tomorrow.

**Tristram:**
Yes. It is quite enjoyable when you know you are being wholeheartedly welcomed.

**Mash:**
So you say, while holding a bow? Do you never put that down?

**Tristram:**
Yes...it seems to be a habit of mine.

**Tristram:**
It seems I used to lay my fingers on these bowstrings even as I slept...

**Tristram:**
Goodness...listening to the sounds and reading the winds at all hours...how much did I love practicing, I wonder...

**Tristram:**
Well, I may fall out of the habit eventually. It seems there is no need for us to fight here.

**Tristram:**
Come, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, Mash. We shall return to our tent as well.

**Voices from the Square:**
Hey, you over there! There's a tomorrow as well, make sure you clean up!

**Voices from the Square:**
Y-yes, I understand. I should clean up after everyone, right...?

**Voices from the Square:**
What else is there to do, you idiot!? You can't accomplish anything unless you're constantly reminded!

**Voices from the Square:**
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...! I'll try harder, I'll try harder...!

**Mash:**
&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait. That voice just now...|


---

**Mash:**
No, let's go back to the tent, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. We're all still outsiders.

**Mash:**
I think we should wait and see a bit if we want to interfere in their affairs.

**Mash:**
You don't like it when someone who doesn't know much about you voices a complaint about you, right?

**Mash:**
Even if the fairies of this village are peaceful, the village is situated in a bad location.

**Mash:**
If some kind of trouble were to occur, we can't escape.

**Mash:**
So be cautious here. Understood?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah...I guess you're right.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm going back to the square.

**Mash:**
Yes. Let's keep our ears open tomorrow.

**Mash:**
If there's something we have a problem with, I'm sure we can come up with a solution if we discuss it.

**Fujimaru 2:**
{{{descjp
**Mash:**
Right, well if you understand&mdash;Hey, weren't you listening!?

**Mash:**
Hah, hah...to have to start running all of a sudden, geez...

**Mash:**
But there's no use complaining. If it's come to this, I'll be a busybody too!

**Mash:**
I'm really bad at this kind of thing, but it's too late to turn back now!

**Mash:**
Wait...huh? There's nobody here in the square?

**Mash:**
It sounded like someone was forced to stay behind and clean up the mess...but it's still all messy?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did we really just hear all that...?|

---

**Mash:**
It appears so. I think something might be amiss, but as long as there's no trouble...

---}
|}

**Mash:**
Let's get back to the tent this time. It seems like this village is dangerous at night.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're right. Let's go.|


---

**--ARROW--:**

**Tristram:**
Good morning, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. I slept well last night...wait...

**Tristram:**
Something doesn't feel right...what I said didn't feel sincere...

**Tristram:**
{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}...{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}...don't you think that doesn't sound quite right?

**Voices from the Square:**
You still haven't cleaned up! You're slacking off again, you useless wretch!

**Mash:**
Someone is yelling in the square. Shall we go and see what's going on, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go!


---

**Doga:**
Of all the cheek! I don't think we'll be able to have a feast tonight.

**Doga:**
Hey. Why haven't you been doing anything? Do you hate {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}?

**???:**
Oh no...no, not at all...it's just...

**???:**
You see...I forgot what I was supposed to be doing...

**???:**
Before I knew it, it was already morning...everyone was scolding me...

**I：Fang Fairy:**
Hey Doga. It's her, you know, I think she's lost it.

**Doga:**
Hah...it was foolish of me to trust you.

**Doga:**
You can be on your way now. Get out of here. You're an eyesore, so stay away from the village.

**???:**
Oh&mdash;thank you for your understanding! Please call on me again!

**Doga:**
Oh. Yo, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}! Yesterday was a lot of fun!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who was that fairy girl...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You left that girl alone to clean up all the mess?


---

**Doga:**
Hmm? You mean that kid?

**Doga:**
Hey, what was that kid's name again?

**I：Fang Fairy A:**
No idea. Hey, what was their name? You said something about it when you came over, didn't you?

**J：Fang Fairy B:**
I think it started with something like “Ho” or “Hu”! Pretty sure it was a stupid name!

**Doga:**
Oh, that's right. She was here from the beginning, wasn't she?

**Doga:**
Well, regardless of the fog, you're done for if you can't even remember your own name.

**Doga:**
{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, if I were you, I'd be minding my own business. You don't want to catch the “nameless” disease, do you?

**Tristram:**
Nameless...you think she has no name? Is that why you treated her the way you did?

**Doga:**
Hm? What good is a nameless fairy? She has no place here anymore.

**I：Fang Fairy A:**
That's right. There's no place for them in this village. Come to think of it, her roof is outside the village, right?

**J：Fang Fairy B:**
Yeah. Can't afford to put it inside the Territory. Lucky she's still breathing, huh?

**J：Fang Fairy B:**
The scars multiply by the day, but she still has her limbs. I wonder if she was actually a great fairy lord in the past?

**J：Fang Fairy B:**
Not that it matters any more!

**J：Fang Fairy B:**
Even the beasts of the forest aren't interested in nameless meat!

**Mash:**
&mdash;

**Doga:**
That's enough boring chit-chat. Let's go, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}!

**Doga:**
I told ya, we're playing football at noon. The playground awaits!

**Tristram:**
What do we do now, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}? They headed for the playground, but...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash. Do you know what a nameless fairy is?|


---

**Mash:**
Well, as the name suggests, it's a fairy who has lost their name.

**Mash:**
We lost our memories in the Nameless Forest, but fairies can lose even their names.

**Mash:**
Fairies are essentially immortal. They do not have the same lifespan as humans or animals.

**Mash:**
But, when we're born, we have a purpose deep in our hearts...something we can be passionate about.

**Mash:**
When a fairy loses that, they lose their name, and then they gradually waste away until they die.

**Mash:**
She's one of those...it's been a long time since she lost her name...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it true that she has no house in the village?|


---

**Mash:**
It must be. Fairies who have lost their names are hated by other fairies.

**Mash:**
The fairies here were generous enough to let us into their village...

**Mash:**
I know what you're thinking, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. But we can't.

**Mash:**
If we invite her to our tent, the other fairies will cause a ruckus.

**Mash:**
What we can do is, well&mdash;

**Mash:**
We can find where she lives and get rid of anything dangerous nearby.

**Mash:**
We can't invite her to the safety of the village, but we can make her home as safe as the village itself.

**Mash:**
I want to do as much as I can to help.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nothing less from our reliable Mash!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, that's a great idea!


---

**Mash:**
Huh? You want to hold hands?

**Mash:**
Hah...joining hands, a show of trust and gratitude... a custom I've never heard of before...

**Mash:**
What a wonderful thing! I think I like this, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}!

**Mash:**
...!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Already an attack by a beast from the forest!|


---

**Tristram:**
I've distanced the girl from the beast.

**Tristram:**
My bewitched strings will not allow it to get any closer to her.

**Mash:**
Thank you, leave the rest to me! Foul beast, don't you dare touch her!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Tristram:**
How cruel it is...I dared to aim for a spot which would cause continuous pain.

**Tristram:**
We can only hope that the beasts will now consider this place dangerous...

**Mash:**
Yes, it was the right thing to do.

**Mash:**
Tristram, are you a former soldier? Or maybe a hunter?

**Mash:**
Whatever you were, you were very good at it! I'm sure the king that you served was very proud of you!

**Tristram:**
That's...indeed. I hope so.

**Mash:**
(That strumming...I don't understand how there's no magical energy involved when he conjures wind...)

**Mash:**
(Is he a member of the Wind Clan? But his magical energy output is low...)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm just glad we got rid of them.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you okay?


---

**Nameless Fairy:**
Huh? Oh my, could it be...

**Nameless Fairy:**
Did you do that for me?

**Mash:**
Yes. {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia} wasn't against it, so I came to check on you.

**Mash:**
You were attacked by those beasts. Are you injured?

**Nameless Fairy:**
Y-yes, but it's the same as always. I'm fine, really.

**Nameless Fairy:**
So, what can I do for you? I've already given you a tour of the village, but...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, no, that's not why...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(So stupid...can't think of anything else.)


---

**Mash:**
We are here to thank you for yesterday.

**Mash:**
Since you were so kind, I wanted to repay the favor by ensuring your home was protected from the beasts of this forest.

**Nameless Fairy:**
&mdash;

**Nameless Fairy:**
Huh!? Ehehehe...I'm so happy. I'm so happy...

**Nameless Fairy:**
I was of some use to you, wasn't I? It's been such a long time. I'm so happy.

**Nameless Fairy:**
Oh right, here, take a blessing of good luck&mdash;a good luck&mdash;

**Nameless Fairy:**
I'm sorry....the blessing, I've forgotten how to use it...

**Nameless Fairy:**
There's no roof over my head...nothing to give back, I don't have anything...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, it's okay. I've already received a thank you.|


---

**Nameless Fairy:**
Really!?

**Nameless Fairy:**
I wonder...what if I gave you the flowers I picked this morning...?

**Mash:**
{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, Tristram.

**Mash:**
I'll put up a barrier to keep the beasts out. It will take some time, so you two should return to the village.

**Tristram:**
Hmm? In that case, we should stay behind. We can't be sure that the beasts won't return.

**Tristram:**
If you're putting up a barrier, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia} and I can protect you until you are finished.

**Mash:**
It's okay, I'm strong enough to fight another one of those beasts.

**Tristram:**
I see...what do you think, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I guess...if Mash says so.|


---

**Mash:**
See you later! Have fun with the fairies in the village!

**Nameless Fairy:**
&mdash;.

**Mash:**
It's finished. Now, no beasts will be able to enter this area.

**Mash:**
Well, it's no Sacrament, just magecraft, so it won't last forever...

**Mash:**
It should still last for a few weeks. You'll be able to sleep peacefully without worrying.

**Nameless Fairy:**
“Magecraft”...the mysterious power that Her Majesty the Queen holds...

**Nameless Fairy:**
I see that you're able to use it too, Mash.

**Nameless Fairy:**
Maybe it's the fashionable thing at the moment?

**Mash:**
Ah&mdash;I wonder, maybe it will catch on... mine is half self-taught, though...

**Mash:**
Maybe I ran away because I didn't want to learn it in the first place...

**Mash:**
It's a bit absurd to ask me to save Britain with something like “magecraft”, but...

**Nameless Fairy:**
Mash...?

**Nameless Fairy:**
I'm sorry...did I say something weird?

**Mash:**
&mdash;N-no, not at all, it's a bad habit of mine.

**Mash:**
It's not your fault that I'm in low spirits. So don't worry about it.

**Mash:**
It's more like...

**Mash:**
I think it's time for you to move on from that village.

**Mash:**
It's not that the fairies there are bad, but the village isn't a good fit for you.

**Nameless Fairy:**
...

**Mash:**
Salisbury wouldn't be bad, but...the Wind Clan might not be so friendly to you if your wings are damaged.

**Mash:**
Perhaps Norwich then? I heard that fairies and humans live there together peacefully.

**Mash:**
Maybe you can find a new “purpose” there. If you find the right person.

**Nameless Fairy:**
Thank you, Mash. But I'm fine here.

**Nameless Fairy:**
Because...even if I found a new “purpose”, I don't have a name any more.

**Nameless Fairy:**
It's certainly been tiring...no matter what I do, no matter how much I try, I can never accomplish anything.

**Nameless Fairy:**
To forget my own name, the most important thing... I must have been truly desperate.

**Nameless Fairy:**
That's why...this is where I belong. I can't get blamed for my past ways here.

**Nameless Fairy:**
A failure who never managed to achieve her “purpose”. A terrible fairy who wasted away her life.

**Mash:**
...

**Nameless Fairy:**
But...that's right. It's all so depressing.

**Nameless Fairy:**
It's not the fact I'm an ostracized by everyone in the village. My “purpose”, that was so important...

**Nameless Fairy:**
To forget even my own name...

**Mash:**
...

**Mash:**
I understand. Not having a name must be miserable.

**Mash:**
Then, how about something like this? Really, it's just an idea I had just now...

**C：Fairy Girl:**
Thank you, Mash...it feels like the first time I've ever been this happy...

**Mash:**
Huh? I'm a little embarrassed, you know...going that far&mdash;

**Mash:**
&mdash;I see. If you're happy, I am happy too.

**Mash:**
But, this is our secret, okay? If anyone in the village heard about this, they'd probably get angry...

**Mash:**
“Even in this abandoned village we have standards, don't bring your ridiculous habits to Cornwall!”

**Mash:**
Or something like that.

**C：Fairy Girl:**
Right!? You can tell that Halobaromia used to be Lady Aurora's attendant.

**C：Fairy Girl:**
He still longs for “the elegant way of being a fairy.”

**C：Fairy Girl:**
I really like that about Halobaromia.

**Mash:**
Yes, definitely! He acts all high and mighty, but I could tell at a glance that he still cares for the village.

**Mash:**
My...I've talked a lot. I've gotta get back to the village.

**Mash:**
I'll come back and see you tomorrow. Sleep well.

**C：Fairy Girl:**
Yeah, bye-bye Mash. I'll see you tomorrow!

**C：Fairy Girl:**
See you...tomorrow...&mdash;huh, wh&mdash;

**C：Fairy Girl:**
What in the world...my right eye, it's really hurting...

**C：Fairy Girl:**
Puddles of tears...my eyes, what is happen&mdash;

**C：Fairy Girl:**
Oh.

**C：Fairy Girl:**
I see...the darkness is overtaking me, isn't it?

**C：Fairy Girl:**
I wonder if it's over... just when I finally had something good happen...

**--ARROW--:**

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Yawn) Good morning...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I had a great night's sleep...


---

**Mash:**
Good morning. We were able to get to sleep early last night since there weren't any festivities.

**Mash:**
What do you want to do today?

**Mash:**
If there's nothing we need to attend to, I'll head outside the village again...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
First, we'll get some breakfast outside...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
With no feast last night, I'm very hungry...


---

**Mash:**
Hm? Something wrong with your stomach?

**Halobaromia:**
Oh, good morning, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. I'm sorry to have made you feel lonely last night.

**Halobaromia:**
I'll be able to prepare the festival properly today, so please look forward to it.

**Halobaromia:**
Huh? What's wrong? You don't look well. Is something the matter?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sorry, I had nothing to eat yesterday...I'm starving...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you have any food?


---

**Halobaromia:**
&mdash;Huh? You haven't eaten any food, so you're hungry?

**Halobaromia:**
Haha, stop joking around. We're not humans. Eating is just for fun, you know?

**Halobaromia:**
Wait...no way. You're not really...? Now that I think about it, could it be&mdash;

**Halobaromia:**
Oh. My. God. I can't believe it! This is really happening...!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, Halobaromia?|


---

**Halobaromia:**
Everybody! A human being! {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia} is human! An unregistered human!!

**I：Fairies:**
Huh!? What rubbish are you spouting this early in the morning? There's no way in hell a human would be in this neck of the woods&mdash;

**Halobaromia:**
I'm sure of it! {(M) His /(F) Her} wings aren't torn off. They're simply not there to begin with!

**Halobaromia:**
Everyone, gather round, quickly! If they get out into the woods, we're in deep trouble!

**Halobaromia:**
Oh, my God! If only I'd realized sooner...!

**Halobaromia:**
I apologize, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}! We've shown you such poor hospitality!

**Halobaromia:**
We need to throw the most exquisite, fun welcome party we've ever had! Oh, what a great day this is!

**J：Fairies:**
Let's see, let's see! Wow, it's true! {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia} is actually human!?

**I：Fairies:**
You're human, a human! No wonder we feel so much better when we're with you!

**K：Fairies:**
Now we're all saved! We won't have to become Mors!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh...huh!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Are we...in trouble...?)


---

**Mash:**
Damn it! That's right, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, if you say that you're hungry...!

**Mash:**
Oh no! The secret is out!

**K：Fairies:**
Are you human too? You're human too, aren't you!? No wings, and no command spells!

**J：Fairies:**
Then what about that harpist dude? Is he a human? No, he's a fairy!

**I：Fairies:**
He hasn't eaten anything! Well whatever, it's a pain, so we'll put them together!

**Halobaromia:**
{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, Mash, Tristram! Please, you must move to the best place in the village!

**Halobaromia:**
In the center of the village, in the square, in the tent! Oh, this is exciting!

**Tristram:**
So...

**Tristram:**
Half a day has passed since we were forced into this tent, without knowing why...

**Tristram:**
Every hour, what can be called nothing less than a feast is brought to us... {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}, is it good?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's good, but I've lost my appetite...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It feels welcoming, but...


---

**Tristram:**
We're not allowed to go outside, and the fairies take turns guarding the tent...

**Tristram:**
This is less of a welcome and more of what you would call “house arrest”. No, it's simply imprisonment.

**Tristram:**
Mash. Do you know why this is happening to us?

**Mash:**
It's because...{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia} is really a human.

**Mash:**
I saw the way you were indulging yourself in those delicious fruits, but...

**Mash:**
I should have noticed, too. But then again, I've never really seen a human before, so...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, are you also human?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, are you a fairy?


---

**Mash:**
Well...I'm really not sure.

**Mash:**
I think I'm a fairy...but I've also been told I'm a bit like a human...

**Mash:**
More importantly, this is the situation we're in.

**Mash:**
{(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia} is being overindulged at the moment, and this is only going to get worse.

**Tristram:**
Much worse.

**Mash:**
Yes. Humans are an indispensable source of nourishment for fairies.

**Mash:**
The mere presence of a human greatly increases morale. It's a kind of spiritual fulfillment.

**Mash:**
But in Britain, the number of humans is tightly controlled by the Queen, so...

**Mash:**
Humans are not assigned to lower class fairies.

**Mash:**
The fairies that have drifted into this village are, after all, those that have fallen out due to the lack of humans.

**Mash:**
So, you know...they'll take care of {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia} either way.

**Mash:**
But...

**Fairies:**
Humans! Humans! Humans in this village!

**Fairies:**
Not a rebel good-for-nothing, not a spy for the Queen, but a decent, honest, human being!

**Fairies:**
What joy, what joy! We must protect him, he can't get hurt!

**Fairies:**
You gotta spice the food up, just nuts and fruits won't work.

**Fairies:**
Let's hunt, hunt, get some meat from the forest! It's a favorite of humans, I was taught!

**Fairies:**
Oh, how I envy those guards. I can't wait for it to be my turn.

**Fairies:**
I wish I could be closer. I'd make them laugh, be embarrassed, make them cry,

**Fairies:**
comb their hair, rub their fingers, peel their skin...

**Fairies:**
But there are only two of them, right? How come Halobaromia gets to call the shots?

**Fairies:**
We're not all gonna have a chance. I'll never get my turn.

**Fairies:**
That's right. Then we'll tear {(M) him /(F) her} apart and share {(M) him /(F) her} with everyone!

**Fairies:**
Dibs on the left eye! You can have the right!

**Fairies:**
Yeah, yeah! I get a ring finger! You get a middle finger!

**Fairies:**
We did it! Now it's all divided equally!

**Doga:**
Oy, what the hell are you guys doing? It's not your turn yet. Get back on the roof.

**Doga:**
Don't you dare do anything crazy to {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. He's a great shot.

**Doga:**
He hits the ball with his head, man. With his head! I've never seen anything like that!

**Doga:**
He's an interesting guy, you know. I'm sure our lives would be a lot more fun with him around&mdash;

**Fairies:**
Doga is so annoying. We don't care for annoying people.

**Fairies:**
It can't be helped, there's only two of them. It can't be helped, there's only two of them.

**Fairies:**
We'll tear them apart and share them with everyone! Tear them apart and share them with everyone!

**Fairies:**
But we're the only ones who will get a share! Only those in the Fang Clan!

**Fairies:**
Earth and Wind are annoying. Let's beat them to the chase!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That sound...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The sound of fighting...?


---

**Mash:**
...

**Tristram:**
I can't see what is going on, but there seems to be a squabble going on among the fairies.

**Tristram:**
Perhaps the discussion about which clan will monopolize you has fallen apart.

**Tristram:**
No matter, your life is in danger if we stay here. We must leave the village as soon as possible.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But, the guards...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Out of the village, to where...?


---

**Mash:**
Let's head to the plains east of here. Through the abandoned villages and into the plains of Britain.

**Mash:**
Once we get there, there's a national highway. We can then figure out which city to head to next.

**Mash:**
But in order to do that, we'll first have to deal with the guards outside...

**Tristram:**
I very much doubt myself and Mash can neutralize them alone...

**Tristram:**
Fairies, whatever they may be, are undoubtedly very powerful creatures. It's not something humans can hope to win again&mdash;oh?

**Fairy Girl:**
Thank goodness. You're all still safe, right?

**Fairy Girl:**
The villagers were acting strangely all morning, so I was watching from afar...

**Fairy Girl:**
It's a bit of a mess...everyone is shouting abuse at each other and starting to fight...

**Fairy Girl:**
Halobaromia has been trying to calm everyone down, but maybe it's time to&mdash;

**Onfam:**
Hey, keep your eyes open. Don't let anyone near the tent.

**Onfam:**
We've killed all the wind guys, but the fanged ones are still here.

**Onfam:**
After all, we can't have those veggie bastards stealing our humans. Us Earth fairies have to share equally, right?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Onfam&mdash;|


---

**Fairy Girl:**
Stop, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. They're not what they used to be.

**Fairy Girl:**
They're drunk on blood and turning increasingly more and more violent.

**Fairy Girl:**
Now, head over to where I crept in. The cloth isn't taut, so you should be able to slip under it.

**Fairy Girl:**
You want to leave the forest, don't you...? Then leave it to me.

**Fairy Girl:**
I know the way to the plains. Come on, quickly!

**Tristram:**
That's the Earth Clan? They've completely transformed...

**Tristram:**
It's saddening... I have to say, they're like the devil himself...

**Mash:**
Tristram, don't use your harp! They'll hear you!

**The Voice of Onfam:**
Huh? Hey, did you hear something?

**The Voice of Onfam:**
It could be a Wind Clan survivor. Ketheli, Gum. You guys, go check it out.

**The Voice of Onfam:**
The rest of us will head for the tent. We'll crush their legs first. Then they won't be able to escape.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is bad! We've gotta get out of here!|


---

**Tristram:**
I'm sorry, for some reason, my fingers are moving on their own...

**Tristram:**
Just get out of this village! I'll bring up the rear!

**Fairy Girl:**
Everyone, this way! Follow me!

**Fairy Girl:**
Hah...hah...hah...

**Fairy Girl:**
Yeah, this is the right way...three more hills, then we'll reach the middle plains...

**Fairy Girl:**
Everyone, how are you doing? We've been running without a break so far, but...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Somehow, I'm okay...!|


---

**Tristram:**
Yes. There were two fairies that followed us, but it seems they lost us around the first hill.

**Mash:**
They must have gotten lost in the fog.

**Mash:**
They lived in the village, and she lived outside of it.

**Mash:**
I'm sure that made all the difference. Thank you very much for guiding us.

**Mash:**
But...was it really okay to do that?

**Mash:**
Now that you've saved us, you can't ever go back to the village...

**Fairy Girl:**
Yeah. I can't go near there any more.

**Fairy Girl:**
But don't worry about it, Mash.

**Fairy Girl:**
Thanks to you, my home will be safe for a while.

**Fairy Girl:**
But sooner than that, as soon as possible... we have to get out of the woods.

**Fairy Girl:**
Faster, faster...faster than everyone else in the village...

**Fairy Girl:**
A little, further...if I could just get you all...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're out of breath, are you okay?|

**Fairy Girl:**
I am, out of breath...? I see. But, we're almost there...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's something on your face...?

**Fairy Girl:**
Huh? What are you talking about, something on my face?


---

**Fairy Girl:**
Oh, the smell of the wind...the nostalgic, earthy smell of Salisbury...

**Fairy Girl:**
We're almost out of the woods...almost...almost...

**Fairy Girl:**
Beautiful Britain, nostalgic Britain...my world, when I still had a name...

**Fairy Girl:**
Fufu...fufufu...almost there...almost there...

**Tristram:**
Hm. There's a slope ahead. It must be the last hill.

**Mash:**
If we go over that hill, we should exit the forest...

**Mash:**
Thank you, friendly fairy. Thanks to you, we're safe... wait, what's wrong!?

**Fairy Girl:**
Ugh, ouch, ouch, ouch...!

**Mash:**
Get a hold of yourself! Does your body hurt!? Let me help&mdash;

**Fairy Girl:**
Uaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shut up! Just shut up!

**Fairy Girl:**
Get your hands off me! Don't touch meeeeee!

**Fairy Girl:**
I want to stay, I want to stay, I want to stay...!

**Fairy Girl:**
I've been here for hundreds of years, alone for hundreds of years!

**Fairy Girl:**
I was forced to do all the things I couldn't do, they just built up and up!

**Fairy Girl:**
Nobody ever helped me before! Nobody even looked at me!

**Fairy Girl:**
Now, now, I didn't need those things after all!

**Fairy Girl:**
Are you all stupid!? Don't you understand!? You've been tricked, you guys!

**Fairy Girl:**
Of course I brought you all the way out here! So I could have you all to myself!

**Fairy Girl:**
Aaah...I don't...want...!

**Fairy Girl:**
AAAAAAAAAAA..!

**Mash:**
Be ready, Tristram, {(M) Lysander /(F) Hermia}. She...is no longer a fairy.

**Mash:**
That's a Mors...life that can no longer speak or hear.

**Mash:**
The black algae that pollutes this world with its existence&mdash;the curse of Britain, killer of fairies.

**--BATTLE--:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think we got it, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
......


---

**Mors:**
&mdash;, &mdash;.

**Tristram:**
Be careful...looks like it has some power left.

**Tristram:**
But, it's not doing anything...does it want to say something...?

**Mash:**
...

**???:**
Excuse me.

**Mors:**
&mdash;...&mdash;, &mdash;...

**???:**
Forgive my rudeness. Delivering the blow of mercy must have been too heavy a burden for you.

**???:**
So, as someone who knows the Mors, I delivered it myself.

**Tristram:**
(From behind, a swift blow from a rapier, as smooth as the wind...! And this intimate sensation&mdash;)

**???:**
I'm sorry...may you rest in peace. May your next life be rewarding.

**Mash:**
No way&mdash;you're&mdash;you're&mdash;

**???:**
Hi. Good to see you, Fujimaru. Sorry it took me so long to get here.

**???:**
Although, I guess you're a bit confused why I've come to meet you. Fufu, I can see it already in your face.

**???:**
Alright. It's a bit strange for a king like me to do this, but since I don't have any subjects with me now, I'll introduce myself.

**???:**
My name is Oberon. I'm a Heroic Spirit summoned by the Human Order.

**???:**
I'm the only servant destined to help you in this Lostbelt.

**???:**
Call me Oberon, King of the Fairies. Whaddya think? Pretty cool, huh?

**--ARROW--:**

**Oberon:**
Call me Oberon, King of the Fairies. Whaddya think? Pretty cool, huh?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right...my name is Fujimaru!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And Tristram

---

**Tristan:**
Yes, let us recall our names&mdash;

**Tristan:**
You are Fujimaru, Master of Chaldea. I am Tristan the Lamenting, Knight of the Spectral Strings.

**Tristan:**
I finally remember everything. And...Mash.

**Tristan:**
You...you aren't named Mash.

**A：???:**
Oberon...? Not Merlin, then...?

**Oberon:**
Merlin?

**A：???:**
No no, sorry. I've got the wrong person, or the wrong image in my head.

**A：???:**
You are similar to the person I had envisioned...

**A：???:**
Ahem. I remember too.

**A：???:**
My name is Caster. Artoria Caster.

**Artoria:**
It's a long and embarrassing story.

**Artoria:**
Caster was my name back in the village, but please call me Artoria.

**Oberon:**
It's such a relief that you have your names back. Ah, but if we aren't quick, we'll get swallowed up by the fog again.

**Oberon:**
Come on, make haste. Our goal is just beyond those trees.

**Oberon:**
You should see the real Britain first. We'll catch up afterwards.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The real Britain...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sure, but we have to get out first...!


---

**Artoria:**
Yes! Let's go, Fujimaru!

**Artoria:**
A utopia loved by wind, earth, life, poetry and rain&mdash;

**Artoria:**
To Britain, the twilit island of fairies!

## Fragment / 1 

**Narration:**
Meanwhile...

**Narration:**
How many days had it been since she and Fujimaru were separated? Just moments earlier, she had escaped the Nameless Forest alone.

**Narration:**
Was it a difference in power as a Servant? Or was it simply good luck?

**Narration:**
No, unfortunately, both of those are wrong. The Mors just swallowed her up, and spat her back out.

**A：???:**
Hah...hah...

**Narration:**
And the results are plain to see.

**Narration:**
With her strength exhausted and her armaments scattered, she had collapsed in front of the national highway.

**Narration:**
It was bad, it was bad! It was really, really bad! Because, if you stay in a place like that...

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
Well, look at that! I figured there'd be one or two here this time of the season.

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
Look at this, one of the Wind Clan's finest! Now we can all get through the winter!

**Narration:**

As you can see, fairies who stray too far out of the woods make easy prey for slavers!

**D：Fairy Peddlers:**
Hey, get the collar on before she wakes up! I don't know who she is, but it's all the same if we can sell her!

**D：Fairy Peddlers:**
I'll sell her to a lord and get a fat paycheck, and she'll get a warm body next to her in bed...

**D：Fairy Peddlers:**
It's a win-win&mdash; Eek, a beast! It's a wolf!

**White Wolf:**
GuRuuuuuuuu...!

**Narration:**
But, it doesn't always work out like that. That's my favorite part.

**Narration:**
At her side were the white fangs of the wise Grimm. No insolent fairy could approach her.

**A：???:**
Mmm...

**D：Fairy Peddlers:**
Crap, she woke up...! Oh no, oh no! She's too strong! She's gonna kill me!

**A：???:**
Um...what are you all...no...

**A：???:**
Why did I collapse here...?

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
(She's got no memory...! What a lucky break...!)

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
H-hey there young lady, good day to you. We're, uh, let's see, what are we...

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
Oh, passing-by good samaritans! Helping fairies collapsed in the road is our job!

**E：Fairy Peddlers:**
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it. We're here to help you, young lady.

**E：Fairy Peddlers:**
Come take a ride on our cart. It's the latest Norwich model, so it's really comfortable.

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
One to pull, two to laugh. Two rest, one gets tired!

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
What, no need to worry. You're valuable goo—I mean, an important customer, young lady.

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
I'm not gonna force you to pull the cart. More importantly, you need a name.

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
Brother, how about Annis? It fits that girl perfectly!

**E：Fairy Peddlers:**
Hm? You're not going to use “Achin” like always? Well, occasionally you come up with something different...

**E：Fairy Peddlers:**
You alright with that, Annis? Here, let me help you up.

**E：Fairy Peddlers:**
If you keep lying on the ground like that, you'll be eaten by the Awd Goggie!

**A：Annis:**
Ah...thank you...very much...

**D：Fairy Peddlers:**
Hey, what's that? Get me that iron stuff! Iron armor, an iron shield, an iron...what is this tube thing?

**D：Fairy Peddlers:**
Could this girl have been a knight of the Queen, carrying so many weapons?

**D：Fairy Peddlers:**
Is this really a good idea...? Won't Her Majesty kill us later?

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
Hah, Wag is always the one to pussy out! Don't worry about it, don't worry!

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
It doesn't matter if she was, she's already forgotten all about it!

**E：Fairy Peddlers:**
Yeah, yeah. No can do about much if she doesn't even remember her name.

**E：Fairy Peddlers:**
If you don't have a place to go, we'll take you to a new place to live.

**Fairies:**
Yeah&mdash;as our latest goods, right?

**Narration:**
The fairies exchanged glances with a vile laugh.

**Narration:**
She was placed on a cart with her things, not even recognizing herself.

**Narration:**
The wagon headed immediately north to Gloucester. With the beginning of another journey, the curtain rises on a new act.

**Narration:**
Well, putting that aside&mdash;

**C：Fairy Peddlers:**
Hey, that wolf is following us! What should we do, brother!?

**E：Fairy Peddlers:**
You mess with that white beast and you'll regret it. If you die, I'll say you ended up as a Mors.

**E：Fairy Peddlers:**
No use, huh...let's take it with us and sell it as a set with the girl.

**Narration:**
As long as her scary-looking chaperone tagged along, the fairies wouldn't get any funny ideas, right?

## Section 2: Salisbury 

**Oberon:**
Beautiful, don't you agree? This is the heartland of the British Lostbelt.

**Oberon:**
If you look over there, you'll see what looks like an evil castle. That's Camelot.

**Oberon:**
The current Britain is divided into north and south, with Camelot at its center.

**Oberon:**
Most of everyone lives in the south, or what we are in the middle of right now.

**Oberon:**
The cathedral city of Salisbury, the port town of Norwich, the trendy city of Gloucester, and the great dining city of Oxford.

**Oberon:**
Those are the four main cities. Each of them is governed by what you could call a clan “head” fairy.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, but what about Mash and da Vinci!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There were two others!


---

**Oberon:**
Ah...I see. You came here with other friends from Chaldea.

**Oberon:**
I'm really sorry...you're the only one I could find.

**Oberon:**
As you can see, I was the only one taking action. I had my hands full looking for one person.

**Oberon:**
But this is perfect, maybe you can tell me about this Mash girl.

**Oberon:**
As long as we know what she looks like, we can track her down. I'll have Blanca look for you.

**Tristan:**
Blanca...? You said you were by yourself, but you had other friends?

**Oberon:**
Whoops, you're right. I'll introduce you.

**Oberon:**
Isn't she cute and fluffy? She's my advisor... or should I say friend?

**Oberon:**
She's tidy, smart, and above all, a hard worker.

**Oberon:**
I'm sure she'll find this Mash of yours.

**Oberon:**
Now that that's settled, let's exchange what we know.

**Oberon:**
You tell me about Chaldea, I'll tell you what I know.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...and that about sums it up.|


---

**Oberon:**
I see...you've conquered five Lostbelts up to now.

**Oberon:**
Britain wasn't the target of an attack, merely to investigate the Collapse,

**Oberon:**
Mash, Leonardo, Tristan, and Fujimaru,

**Oberon:**
the four of you made landfall in Britain, but lost track of each other in the Nameless Forest...

**Oberon:**
That's a problem. No, it's my fault. It's not just you that were lost...

**Oberon:**
If I had paid more attention then, I might have been able to go after Mash and Leonardo.

**Oberon:**
I was so excited I found you, that I forgot about everything else...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I knew it, the last thing I saw on the beach was you, Oberon?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
With that fog I don't think you had a choice...


---

**Oberon:**
&mdash;You're probably right. But, there's something I need to check first.

**Oberon:**
Mash is your contracted Servant, right? Then you're connected through a path of magical energy.

**Oberon:**
So long as she's all right, you may not know where she is, but you should know she's still alive.

**Oberon:**
Well? As a Master, you should be able to do that much, right?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
My connection to Mash is still active!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm so relieved...


---

**Oberon:**
Good. Then all that's left is to find her.

**Oberon:**
Leonardo's a Servant as well, right? Then a little thing like that shouldn't be a problem.

**Oberon:**
Fortunately, the fairies here can't tell the difference between fairies and Servants.

**Oberon:**
As long as you're not human, it's not that dangerous. Trust in your friends and don't lose your head.

**Oberon:**
Right, next. Artoria, anything you want to say to me?

**Artoria:**
N-no, not right now. Chaldea, Pan-human History, Lostbelts...

**Artoria:**
I've never heard any of this before, so it's all over my head...ahaha...

**Artoria:**
But, um, Servants, was it? A Heroic Spirit...is it like a human who becomes a fairy after death?

**Artoria:**
So for example, someone like Tristram...no, I mean Tristan here?

**Oberon:**
Mm. For an explanation of Heroic Spirits and Servants, Fujimaru can tell you more on the road.

**Oberon:**
A citizen of the Lostbelt and a Master from pan-human history. You two can fill the gaps in each other's knowledge.

**Tristan:**
On the road...do you have somewhere to go, Oberon?

**Oberon:**
Yeah, we do. If we're looking for someone, we have to go to a big city.

**Oberon:**
You and Fujimaru need to get used to the rules of the Fairy Kingdom.

**Oberon:**
We're headed to Salisbury, the biggest city in the south. We can get food, clothing and all the basics there.

**Oberon:**
From here, it'll take a whole day. You look like you've been up all night, can you walk?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.|

**Oberon:**
Good answer. Half enthusiastic, half composed. I like you, Fujimaru


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can't just rest...!

**Oberon:**
Whoa, hold on there. I know how you feel, but didn't I just say to calm down?

**Oberon:**
Britain's a big place. If you're not careful, you'll collapse before you find Mash.

**Oberon:**
Come on. Just as you can confirm she's safe as a Master,

**Oberon:**
my instincts tell me she's safe as well.

**Oberon:**
After all, I'm the Fairy King. My hunches are spot-on. First up is Salisbury.


---

**Artoria:**
S-Salisbury, you say?

**Artoria:**
(Hmm, what should I do...going back now might be too dangerous...)

**Artoria:**
(But I can't leave Fujimaru alone...)

**Artoria:**
(I know I said it before, but this Oberon person is really Merlin-esque...)

**Artoria:**
U-um! Is it alright if I accompany you!?

**Artoria:**
I was the one who used Mash's name by accident...

**Artoria:**
I'd at least like to hear all about Fujimaru's circumstances and about pan-human history!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, I assumed you would be coming along...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Ah, that's right, you weren't involved...!


---

**Artoria:**
Ye-yes, I am!! Why am I acting so brazen...!

**Artoria:**
Yes. Nobody would like a bumpkin like me around... huh?

**Artoria:**
You're holding out your hand...is this another handshaking?

**Artoria:**
Are you saying it's okay for me to come with you?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course. We'd be glad to have you, Artoria.|


---

**Oberon:**
&mdash;Yeah. What a beautiful friendship.

**Oberon:**
I was on edge in Cornwall, but turns out I made the right choice by not helping.

**Oberon:**
It's a theatrical way of saying “all the actors are assembled, now raise the curtain!” don't you think?

**Oberon:**
Chaldea can't do it alone. And just the Child of Prophecy won't be enough.

**Oberon:**
Yes&mdash;after all, it will take both of them to defeat the all-powerful Morgan.

**--ARROW--:**

**Fairies:**
Ah, the prophecy was true. That child is our shining hope.

**Fairies:**
With this, we are saved. With this, we are forgiven.

**Fairies:**
A Savior was washed ashore on board a boat bearing many treasures.

**Fairies:**
Recite the name of promise, hear and deliver the voice of paradise.

**Fairies:**
Oh, my beloved Artoria.

**Fairies:**
May you grow healthy and strong to the age of 16. May the Queen's soldiers never find you.

**Fairies:**
You must journey to ring the six bells and save Britain. You must journey to make way for the true king.

**Fairies:**
Gloucester, Salisbury, Oxford, Norwich, Orkney.

**Fairies:**
The sixth and final one is not in the prophecy, but you will surely find it.

**Fairies:**
Chosen by the Staff of Selection, you are the only hope of the Fairy Kingdom.

**Fairies:**
&mdash;Now, hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

**Fairies:**
Hurry, and reach 16 years of age. We believe in your everything.

**Fairy:**
...the village is done for. The executioners are already here.

**Fairy:**
Lift your head. Grasp your staff. It's time for you to set out, Artoria.

**Fairy:**
No matter what anybody says, or even if you doubt it yourself, you are definitely the Child of Prophecy.

**Fairy:**
You're just like her, kiddo.

**Artoria:**
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

**Artoria:**
I'm sorry I'm so weak...I'm sorry I let you down...

**Artoria:**
I'm trying...I'm trying...I'm trying as hard as I can...

**Artoria:**
Mmh...mmh...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria, are you already asleep...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're in front of a bonfire, so...you know...


---

**Artoria:**
&mdash;Uwa!

**Artoria:**
Did I just doze off!? Tristan was playing his lyre... and so...

**Tristan:**
How saddening...my kin&mdash;ahem, excuse me.

**Tristan:**
My lyre appears to not to be to Lady Artoria's taste... I merely attempted to ease her fatigue in my own way, but...

**Artoria:**
Ehehe...sorry, I'm a little new to music.

**Artoria:**
But, it's good to know I'll sleep well! Please let me listen later, when it's time for bed!

**Tristan:**
Lady Artoria does not understand the heart of a poet... ah, how painful...

**Oberon:**
Can't be helped. We walked all day to get this far.

**Oberon:**
I'm tired as well. Let's rest here for tonight and get to Salisbury tomorrow morning.

**Oberon:**
Artoria, can you ward the area against beasts? I'm sorry to ask you while you're drowsy, but...

**Artoria:**
Y-yes. I'll be off now.

**Oberon:**
Well then...

**Oberon:**
On the way here, we explained to Artoria that pan-human history was just the “world next door.”

**Oberon:**
But, that's not really true. pan-human history is the correct way of things, and is mutually exclusive from this Fairy Kingdom of Britain.

**Oberon:**
You Chaldeans have to destroy this Lostbelt.

**Oberon:**
You're worried about how you're going to break the truth to Artoria, aren't you? You want to avoid hurting her as much as possible.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hiding it is in itself a betrayal, but...


---

**Oberon:**
I see. You're up to five now, aren't you? Each time, you've betrayed the people of the Lostbelt.

**Oberon:**
Sheesh...I'm proud to be a chatterbox, but...

**Oberon:**
Finding the right thing to say about your traumas isn't easy.

**Oberon:**
Right. So, that's why I'll just reassure you here.

**Oberon:**
Don't worry, Fujimaru. This Lostbelt won't be destroyed by you.

**Oberon:**
After all, it's trying to destroy itself. Actually, I think this time you'll be the one to save it.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
To save...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Lostbelt?


---

**Oberon:**
Yeah. This Britain isn't “just another prosperous human history.”

**Oberon:**
It's a defective world that will die if left alone. In a word, it is a “mistaken history”.

**Oberon:**
The problem is its destruction would have after-effects on pan-human history.

**Oberon:**
As the ones on the side of that, we have to save Britain at all costs.

**Oberon:**
To overthrow the one who has lorded over this land for two thousand years&mdash;Queen Morgan.

**Tristan:**
Ah! Hold up. By Morgan, you mean that Morgan?

**Oberon:**
Yeah, the very same.

**Oberon:**
The great Achilles' heel of King Arthur, who ruled over Britain in pan-human history.

**Oberon:**
The peerless witch who, in order to get into Camelot, set many traps,

**Oberon:**
and who used her own child with Arthur—Mordred, the Knight of Treachery.

**Oberon:**
The woman who brought Britain to ruin, Morgan. That's the name of the queen who will bring this Fairy Kingdom to ruin.

**Oberon:**
Well, I guess you all would call her the “Lostbelt King?”  Is that right?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Queen Morgan&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
King Arthur's archfoe, in this Lostbelt...


---

**Oberon:**
Anyway, from what I've heard, the problems in the outside world are probably being caused by her.

**Oberon:**
As long as Morgan is defeated, pan-human history should be in the clear.

**Oberon:**
What happens after that, you can leave up to this island's original fate.

**Oberon:**
Whether it destroys itself or manages to recover, that's not your cross to bear.

**Oberon:**
Look. A Lostbelt needs a Fantasy Tree to maintain its existence, right?

**Oberon:**
It's probably that world tree you see beyond that ocean...the huge ash tree-looking thing, but..

**Oberon:**
As you can see, it died a while back. That's why this Lostbelt doesn't have much longer to live.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It died a while ago...|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Didn't it burn up?

**Oberon:**
Yeah, it was all ablaze a little while back! It went out pretty quick, but I wonder what that was all about?


---

**Oberon:**
Well, let's wrap it up for tonight. It's not good to cram too much information in at once.

**Oberon:**
To sum up tonight:

**Oberon:**
“The Fairy Kingdom's ruler is Queen Morgan! Kick her ass!”

**Oberon:**
That's all you need to know.

**Oberon:**
We'll continue this when we reach Salisbury.

**Oberon:**
You'll really get the feeling of Britain when you see an actual fairy city&mdash;

**Oberon:**
Sorry to drop the middle of a conversation, but we've got monsters! Fujimaru, get ready for combat!

**Artoria:**
I'm sooooorryyyyyyyy!! I screwed up the warding spells...!

**Artoria:**
Now I attracted a flock of wild birds...! Please help me!

**Tristan:**
&mdash;Heh. For my king to ask for assistance, what a&mdash;

**Tristan:**
Excuse me...she is not King Arthur. How embarrassing, for me of all people...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I see, Tristan is&mdash;)|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Even if she's someone else, you can be happy!

**Tristan:**
Yes...I feel sorry for the other Rounds. This is a great honor.


---

**Oberon:**
Here they come! Britain's beasts are ferocious! Be careful, Fujimaru!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Artoria:**
Yay! An overwhelming victory! That felt great!

**Tristan:**
A refreshing victory for the first time since I was summoned...I am overjoyed...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We've had it rough so far...|

**Tristan:**
Indeed. We may not be as good as fairies, but a demonic beast such as this is no match for a Knight of the Round Table.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Artoria, are you...(actually a sore loser?)

**Artoria:**
Ah no, it's nothing, nothing at all. I'm just glad to be able to play an active role, ahaha...


---

**Oberon:**
I see. So that's what you guys are capable of now. Even a pack of nachtkrapp are no trouble for you.

**Oberon:**
That's good. Better than expected, even.

**Oberon:**
Tristan's bow is less powerful, but has great range.

**Oberon:**
His specialty is group combat. With you here, we don't have to worry about being outnumbered.

**Oberon:**
And Artoria, who's not as tomboyish as she looks. Is that marvelous device of yours handmade?

**Oberon:**
Strange weapons are useful against new enemies. They can be a good distraction.

**Oberon:**
And&mdash;

**Oberon:**
Above it all, Fujimaru's summoning is hilarious!

**Oberon:**
Temporarily summoning Heroic Spirits...your ability to respond and overcome is beyond expectations.

**Oberon:**
Human magecraft isn't very effective on fairies. But if you summon Heroic Spirits, it's a different story.

**Oberon:**
I guess the issue is Fujimaru's physical strength? Physical power, magical energy, and karmic power.

**Oberon:**
The longer the battle continues, the more danger you'll be in as the summoner.

**Oberon:**
So long as you mind that, you'll be able to manage against fairies, probably.

**Artoria:**
Wait a second. Human magecraft...magecraft is...

**Artoria:**
Fujimaru, you use magecraft!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, thanks to my Mystic Code, I guess.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is it that surprising?


---

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Artoria:**
Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm just a little astonished...

**Artoria:**
Magecraft isn't used all that much in Britain, so...well...

**Artoria:**
Since fairies perform Sacraments without the use of things like a Thaumaturgical Foundation, Magic Formula, or Mystic Codes...

**Artoria:**
Magecraft is viewed as “something you don't need” or “something only used by weirdos.”

**Artoria:**
To put it bluntly, if you can only use magecraft, they say “Eww, you have to prepare each thing separately,”

**Artoria:**
and everyone looks down on you...ahaha...

**Tristan:**
I see. Indeed, fairies have no need of magecraft.

**Tristan:**
Since this Britain is a fairyland, you could say the value of magecraft is almost nil...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then, why does Artoria use it?|


---

**Artoria:**
Uwa, you asked...after all that, you asked, Fujimaru...

**Oberon:**
Now now. It was just a simple question. There was no malice in it, okay Artoria?

**Oberon:**
If it's a sore subject, you don't have to answer.

**Oberon:**
And Fujimaru, let's talk about this some other time. Have a little tact, okay?

**Oberon:**
Now then, did you all forget what our original plan was? We went through all that, just to sleep out here.

**Oberon:**
We'll get a good night's sleep tonight.

**Oberon:**
Artoria probably wants to know more about Fujimaru too, but save that for tomorrow morning.

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Oberon:**
Luckily, there aren't any of the Queen's soldiers, Mors, or rebels in the area.

**Oberon:**
We'll wake up in the morning, walk an hour, and be in Salisbury.

**Oberon:**
We'll have a more in-depth conversation then. Let's save the fun stuff for when we're more composed, in better surroundings, alright?

**--ARROW--:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, that's a rough history of the world until 2015 AD.|


---

**Artoria:**
Wow...so another world really existed...England... Scotland...Ireland...

**Artoria:**
Not only that, but outside of the island, there's France? And Italy? And so on.

**Artoria:**
So many countries, so many people, each and every one with their own culture...

**Artoria:**
I can't imagine what it must be like to come from such a wonderful place.

**Artoria:**
But a “Britain without fairies”! That sounds refreshing and interesting!

**Oberon:**
From Fujimaru's point of view, I think this fairyland Britain is the more interesting one.

**Oberon:**
But, there's something to be corrected here.

**Oberon:**
Pan-human history...it's wrong to say that there are no fairies in Fujimaru's world.

**Oberon:**
Despite the fact that Mystery faded with the transition into the common era, the fairies do remain.

**Oberon:**
There are not many of them left, and they seldom show themselves in front of other people. I actually sort of fall into that category as a Heroic Spirit.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Speaking of which, Oberon...|


---

**Oberon:**
“A Midsummer Night's Dream”, right?

**Oberon:**
Shakespeare, the greatest English playwright who ever lived. He wrote a story about fairies.

**Oberon:**
The story...to put it simply, it's a love triangle between three humans.

**Oberon:**
The fairy King is Oberon. His estranged Queen is called Titania.

**Oberon:**
Oberon, in an attempt to get Titania to give up her changeling, concocts a magical potion.

**Oberon:**
When applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living being that they set their eyes on.

**Oberon:**
A human named Lysander, having been mistaken for another human and having the love potion accidently applied,

**Oberon:**
forgets his days with the love of his life, Hermia, to whom he had pledged his future, and believes someone else to be his eternal lover.

**Oberon:**
Well, a lot happens, and in the end, they get back together.

**Oberon:**
It's a self-serving play about love, a light comedy...

**Oberon:**
The problem is, it became a popular play that was passed down from generation to generation.

**Oberon:**
Thanks to this, fairies like “Puck the Trickster”, and “Oberon the hard-hearted Fairy King” are now well established.

**Oberon:**
So...I guess you could say, I'm the most famous fairy in the entire world.

**Oberon:**
If you're interested, you can always read it after you return to Chaldea.

**Oberon:**
He's a hopeless king who can't do anything right, but be lenient with him.

**Oberon:**
I swear there was no harm intended, okay?

**Oberon:**
It was an overdramatic stage scene, so I could get my darling to pay attention to me.

**Artoria:**
Then is Oberon a fictional fairy? A character only found in the story?

**Artoria:**
How can something so ambiguous become a Servant?

**Tristan:**
Not so. Shakespeare's “A Midsummer Night's Dream” is one of the greatest plays ever written, but...

**Tristan:**
“Oberon, King of the Fairies” is said to be a legend that has been handed down in Europe since time immemorial.

**Tristan:**
Even before Shakespeare's time, in the 15th century.

**Tristan:**
He was heralded as “the king of fairies, whom can fulfill any desire using magic.”

**Oberon:**
Really? I didn't know that.

**Oberon:**
For what it's worth, they both had an original inspiration. That “inspiration”...that's who was recorded as a Servant.

**Oberon:**
Perhaps, that's who I am. It's like trying to determine which came first, the chicken or the egg.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see...|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And, what about Titania?

**Oberon:**
That's a total Shakespearean creation. There is no such name in traditional fairy history.

**Oberon:**
Titania...a corruption of Titan, perhaps? A creation from Greek mythology?

**Oberon:**
The Oberon in “A Midsummer Night's Dream” is an egoist.

**Oberon:**
Any woman who could forgive his selfishness would only exist in fiction.


---

**Oberon:**
Anyway...sorry, I'm wasting your time talking about this.

**Oberon:**
Salisbury is up ahead. I'll deal with the gatekeeper.

**Oberon:**
You guys stay quiet and follow me. I mean, they'll recognise me.

**Oberon:**
Also, if they ask you for your name, don't answer them. If they press for it, make something up.

**Oberon:**
If they find out you're a human, you're in trouble. You never know who'll be listening.

**Tristan:**
Wait...is is not risky to lie to fairies?

**Tristan:**
It is said that their eyes can see through lies. Isn't avoiding falsehoods of the utmost importance?

**Oberon:**
Ah, don't worry. The fairies here don't have Fairy Eyes.

**Oberon:**
Maybe their ability was lost to time, or abandoned for the greater good.

**Oberon:**
Regardless, they can't see your true feelings. Until the results come in, they can't tell good from bad.

**Oberon:**
After all, if they had them, how could an evil like Morgan prosper?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is Salisbury...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's a big cathedral...!


---

**Tristan:**
I'm glad. The air here is different from Cornwall.

**Tristan:**
There are fairies everywhere, but I do not sense any immediate danger from them...

**Tristan:**
Everyone is smiling, with an air of positivity. Perhaps there is a festival taking place.

**Artoria:**
No, it's just the way things are in this city. It's Britain's only free city.

**Artoria:**
The population is about 200,000 here in Salisbury. Not just from the Wind, Earth, and Fang clans&mdash;

**Artoria:**
It's home to both natural fairies and humans who have gained the right to independence.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A human who has gained independence?|


---

**Oberon:**
“Belonging to nobody, but Britain itself”, a free human, if you will.

**Oberon:**
I thought we'd talk about that when we were a bit more settled...

**Oberon:**
It's not something that can be kept secret forever. There's also the matter of the cathedral. I'll explain now.

**Oberon:**
You came to the conclusion that there were no humans here in this Fairy Kingdom, but strictly speaking, that's not entirely true.

**Oberon:**
Humans exist. But they're not the apex species of this world.

**Oberon:**
They're tools for the enrichment of fairy society... almost like the slaves of pan-human history.

**Oberon:**
Doesn't this city seem a little bit off to you? There's something strange about it. Something that doesn't belong.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If you ask me...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It feels like a human city.


---

**Oberon:**
Yes. Originally, the fairies lived alongside nature.

**Oberon:**
Even if they did band together, they were just a gathering of forest children and stone children under the Great Mother.

**Oberon:**
Fairies were Bunrei—offshoot spirits— with no concept of a “civilization of their own”.

**Oberon:**
However, here in the Fairy Kingdom, as you can see, they've imitated human society.

**Oberon:**
For about 14,000 years now.

**Oberon:**
These British fairies have been breeding humans, and continued to thrive using their creativity as entertainment.

**Oberon:**
Fairies have long lives, strong vitality, and can live just fine in the spur of the moment.

**Oberon:**
Thanks to their strong versatility, human-like “growth and development” isn't needed. On the other hand, humans are riddled with weaknesses.

**Oberon:**
They're short-lived, their injuries don't heal, they need to eat constantly, and they'll quickly end up dead if ambushed by a wild beast.

**Oberon:**
Inevitably, humans have had to accumulate knowledge and devise ways to survive and prosper.

**Oberon:**
The human mindset must have been “charming and fascinating” to the fairies.

**Oberon:**
They reared humans, and built entire cities that mimicked only the outward-facing aspects of human culture.

**Oberon:**
Agricultural knowledge, building engineering, and many academic disciplines...

**Oberon:**
They mimicked them in form, but completely ignored the actual underlying contents.

**Oberon:**
They're just surface-level copies, look-alikes. Magical energy takes care of the rest.

**Oberon:**
The best example is that cathedral. The fairies have no gods, and no concept of religion.

**Oberon:**
They didn't have any reason to build that cathedral. But they built it because it was fun.

**Oberon:**
That's the culture of this fairyland, and the way they treat humans.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Umm, in other words...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They're ripping off human culture?


---

**Oberon:**
Hm...well, I guess that's one way to put it.

**Oberon:**
Even if my situation is different, I'm still a fairy as well.

**Oberon:**
In a world with few humans, I can understand why they ended up this way.

**Oberon:**
Both in pan-human history and in this Lostbelt, humans are something that fairies toy with to kill time.

**Oberon:**
The society that has achieved ultimate control over humans is this Fairy Kingdom,

**Oberon:**
and it was under the policy of your enemy, Queen Morgan.

**Artoria:**
Huh? Fujimaru and the others are going up against Morgan?

**Oberon:**
Yeah. That's the plan for now, right, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm still trying to figure out what is going on...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We need to meet the King of this Lostbelt...


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But first, we need to find Mash and da Vinci...|


---

**Oberon:**
Oops, that's right. We're getting our priorities muddled.

**Oberon:**
Let's head to a tavern for now. Where people gather, there's always a chance of hearing some good information.

**Artoria:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You've frozen in place, what's the matter?


---

**Artoria:**
You see...Fujimaru saved my life, and while I'm certainly indebted to you...

**Artoria:**
(I don't know what to do...if they're going to be fighting Her Majesty Morgan, my presence would certainly be a nuisance...)

**Artoria:**
(I thought I would stick around until we found Mash, but maybe it's right to part ways here...)

**Oberon:**
O-ho.

**Oberon:**
&mdash;Ahem. By the way, Artoria.

**Oberon:**
Do you know what happens when a human is found without their master in this city?

**Oberon:**
They're treated as a fugitive who escaped from a farm, and sent to New Darlington.

**Artoria:**
New Darlington...w-wait, the “National Slaughter Theatre” Darlington?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
National Slaughter...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Theatre...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Come again?


---

**Artoria:**
W-well, that doesn't sound very nice...this is the city of freedom, Salisbury, remember?

**Artoria:**
In a city ruled by the head of the Wind Clan, such horrible treatment is simply impossible...

**Oberon:**
Nope. Even though she's the head of the Wind Clan, she can't go against the Queen's decree.

**Oberon:**
More importantly, as head, it's important to have as many reliable collaborators and sympathizers as possible.

**Oberon:**
Fujimaru is a lost child who doesn't know left from right, and more importantly, is also human.

**Oberon:**
Without a “master” being present, we'll end up with a repeat of what happened in the “Nameless Forest”.

**Oberon:**
I'm a prince, as you can see, so...

**Oberon:**
Having a {(M) boy /(F) girl} of unknown origin as my squire, something like that isn't going to convince many.

**Oberon:**
You're a much better match for Fujimaru.

**Oberon:**
Oh, I'm not saying you should be together forever. Just as long as we're in Salisbury.

**Oberon:**
More than anything...it's more convenient for you too, right? It's better than being alone, you know?

**Artoria:**
I guess that's true...with Britain as it is now, you'd be questioned if you're alone, wouldn't you?

**Artoria:**
But, why not just have Tristan pretend to be Fujimaru's Master?

**Oberon:**
It's not impossible, but Tristan doesn't know much about the Fairy Kingdom.

**Oberon:**
If he were interrogated by the clan's guards, they'd be able to call his bluff immediately. If I were you, I wouldn't risk it.

**Artoria:**
B-but, but only high-class fairies can take humans as servants, and...if I'm one of those...

**Artoria:**
If I become Fujimaru's master&mdash;

**Oberon:**
It's just for appearances' sake. Would you prefer {(M) him /(F) her} to be your pet?

**Artoria:**
T-t-t-t-that's disrespectful! I-I-I-I-I'm not ready for something like that!

**Oberon:**
Great, then it's decided.

**Oberon:**
Fujimaru. Artoria will be your master for a little while.

**Oberon:**
We're doing this so that we can travel through Britain safely. Can you play the part?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nice to meet you, too.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's not my first time acting.


---

**Artoria:**
...(sigh). If it's alright with you, it's alright with me.

**Artoria:**
We've made it this far together, so let's work together a little longer, everyone.

**Artoria:**
Yes, this is something to be positive about. I guess, it's one of my old dreams come true!

**Tristan:**
...? Excuse me, Caster. What would you say that dream was?

**Artoria:**
It's a dream of every fairy who grew up in the countryside. To be one of the upper echelon fairies in a big city, you know?

**Oberon:**
&mdash;

**Oberon:**
Well, well, well, good day to you, the fine folk of Salisbury! Are we all having a good time?

**Oberon:**
Fairy King of the Autumn Forest, preacher of flowers, peace, and fairy tales, the boisterous Oberon, sorry to intrude!

**I：Fairy (Tavern Keeper):**
Yo, Oberon, glad to see you're doing well! You're in Salisbury again!

**I：Fairy (Tavern Keeper):**
Maybe today's the day you've come to pick up your tab!

**N：Fairy holding a Wooden Cup:**
Oh, to see Oberon's face makes it all worthwhile to be drinking in the middle of the day!

**N：Fairy holding a Wooden Cup:**
Have you come to repay what I loaned you last time?

**D：Garden-loving Fairy:**
Oberon! Thanks to you, the trees in my backyard are much more docile!

**D：Garden-loving Fairy:**
But, you've gotta give me my money back!

**E：Fairy in a Dress:**
The wonderful Oberon, do you have any time? I hope you'll come to our tea party today!

**E：Fairy in a Dress:**
And, you've gotta give me my money back!

**F：A Fairy with a Mighty Physique:**
I've been waiting for you, you poor penniless prince! Come here, I'll buy you a drink!

**F：A Fairy with a Mighty Physique:**
But first, you've gotta give me my money back!

**Oberon:**
Hahahahaha.

**Oberon:**
Stop it, gentlemen! Don't make me out to be the most popular man on the planet!

**Oberon:**
I'm with a very dear friend today, so keep quiet about the money!

**Fairies:**
Hahahahahahaha!

**Fairies:**
We know, we know. We're just having a laugh!

**Fairies:**
You've given us so much more, who cares about the Queen's coin! Let us buy you a drink!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Money...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Penniless prince...?


---

**Artoria:**
Are you broke, by any chance? Even though you call yourself a king?

**Oberon:**
Well, my financial situation is in a bit of a pickle. Being broke, you could say that, yes.

**Oberon:**
But it can't be helped, you know? When I was summoned to this Fairy Kingdom, all I had was this cloak.

**Oberon:**
When I woke up, I was literally naked in the middle of a forest, on top of a pile of dead leaves.

**Oberon:**
Normally, I'd stay there, waiting for someone from pan-human history to come and help, but...

**Oberon:**
You've gotta do what you gotta do when you're the one who was summoned first.

**Oberon:**
Fairies are creatures who flutter around “interesting” things. That's why I've been visiting various cities.

**Oberon:**
I've sang songs, made everyone merry, told fairy tales, made the evenings lively, and even entertained the ladies.

**Oberon:**
Through my diligent activities, I've made a name for myself in Britain as “The Fairy King that rules somewhere nobody knows.”

**Oberon:**
Well, it's only a reputation that extends to the major cities.

**Artoria:**
Ah...so the reason I didn't know you, Oberon, was because my village was in the countryside...

**Oberon:**
I'm sorry about that. Henceforth, I'll ponder about an expedition to the countryside.

**Oberon:**
But, after all, this was just one battle.

**Oberon:**
Do you have any idea how it felt, to act all “high and mighty” all the time, while being completely broke?

**Tristan:**
Indeed... I often masqueraded as someone I was not, and sang of my love of beautiful ladies in bars...

**Tristan:**
No, it must have been difficult...I understand the exhilaration, no, the tension you must have felt...

**Tristan:**
Oberon. As a fellow poet, I have the utmost respect for your efforts.

**Tristan:**
If you could tell me, in detail, about your successful exploits in this Fairy Kingdom later on...

**Oberon:**
If you're up for it, it would be my pleasure. With your performance, we'll attract even more and more patrons.

**Artoria:**
I see, I see! Tristan and Oberon are kindred spirits. Both enemies of women!

**Artoria:**
So, Oberon. Where is a good place for us to sit?

**Oberon:**
At the back of the tavern, there's a raised area with a circular table that I prefer.

**Oberon:**
It's hard for the other customers to see you, and you'll get a full view of the place.

**Oberon:**
Let's start with a toast. We'll order some fruit juice. Hey there cutie, are you the new waiter?

**Oberon:**
Tell the owner I'll take the back table. And four fruit juices, please.

**K：Waitress:**
Yes, thank you for your order~! We'll have it ready soon, so please take your time and enjoy yourself~!

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Huh?|


---

**K：Waitress:**
&mdash;Huh?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Da Vinci-chan!?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
No way, really!? Yay, it's Fujimaru&mdash;!

**--ARROW--:**

**Da Vinci:**
Jeez, just listen to me already!

**Da Vinci:**
After we were separated by the fog, I followed a hunch, and walked back to the beach!

**Da Vinci:**
Luckily, after heading east along the coast, away from that fog-shrouded forest,

**Da Vinci:**
I found Salisbury. I figured that since there were more people, I could gather information.

**Da Vinci:**
And then...

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
A heavenly angel descended into my store.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
She had an unsteady gait, yet with an unshakable will hiding in her blue eyes, she said:

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
“What a wonderful shop. Please let me work here until the day I die.”

**Da Vinci:**
I didn't say that!

**Da Vinci:**
I told you, I was looking for a human, and simply asked for a glass of water first!

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Tch. Well, you're always welcome to become my housewife! If you change your mind anytime, just let me know!

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, yeah. Get back to the counter, Mike. I'll show you how to make a cocktail later.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Hehe. Hehehe. Ah, Dabinchi...my angel...

**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, that's what I've been up to.

**Da Vinci:**
I'm glad you're safe, Fujimaru, Tristan.

**Da Vinci:**
As for Mash...it doesn't seem like we've been able to meet up with her yet.

**Oberon:**
I see, the other Servant that Fujimaru mentioned,

**Oberon:**
that's you, isn't it? I'm honored to meet the renaissance genius Leonardo da Vinci.

**Da Vinci:**
And you? You know my name, so are you a Servant from pan-human history?

**Oberon:**
I'm Oberon. King of Fairies, Oberon. Well, over here, “King of Fairies” is just a job title.

**Artoria:**
Nice to meet you, da Vinci.

**Artoria:**
I'm Artoria Caster. I met Fujimaru in the forest.

**Artoria:**
Now...well, there's a lot going on, and as Fujimaru's owner,

**Artoria:**
it's a relief to have finally met you...

**Da Vinci:**
Well, isn't this interesting!

**Da Vinci:**
That's a relief, Fujimaru!

**Da Vinci:**
Thanks, Artoria. But you're a fairy from this Britain, aren't you?

**Da Vinci:**
I'm sure you've heard our situation to some degree, but...

**Da Vinci:**
Furthermore, you're lending a hand to Fujimaru, right?

**Artoria:**
Y-yes, well...

**Artoria:**
To tell the truth, I don't really understand half the things Oberon and Fujimaru say...

**Artoria:**
But I can tell Fujimaru isn't lying.

**Artoria:**
I can't bring myself to ignore people in need, and to be honest, it's a little fun.

**Da Vinci:**
I see. Then it's alright to talk here.

**Da Vinci:**
So, Fujimaru, can you tell us what you've been up to so far?

**Da Vinci:**
I see...so that's what happened in the woods. In any case, I'm glad you two are alright.

**Da Vinci:**
Thanks for guarding {(M) him /(F) her}, Tristan. You too, Oberon and Artoria.

**Da Vinci:**
“We still don't know much about Britain.” “We don't know where Mash is.”

**Da Vinci:**
“But we're sure Mash is okay.” “Oberon is completely broke.”

**Da Vinci:**
Right. If all that is clear, we can take proper measures from now on.

**Da Vinci:**
Oberon's judgement was correct.

**Da Vinci:**
What we should do now is not move around Britain aimlessly.

**Da Vinci:**
Gather information using Salisbury as a base, and solve our problems one by one.

**Da Vinci:**
Our first priority is “finding Mash.” I'll gather information about “a girl wearing iron armor”...

**Da Vinci:**
And in the process we'll be able to learn about the state of Britain and the situation of the fairies living in it.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Based here?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Da Vinci, are you staying somewhere?


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, of course I am. This tavern doubles as an inn.

**Da Vinci:**
Well, to be precise, it's a building that closely resembles “an inn built by humans.”

**Da Vinci:**
Mike didn't know what an “inn” was. I had to show him how to make use of the spare rooms.

**Da Vinci:**
In return, I was allowed to use the three rooms on the second floor☆

**Da Vinci:**
Meaning, I've set up Chaldea's forward base. I believe I'll be able to join you at some point.

**Tristan:**
Oho...I would expect nothing less of da Vinci... the girl Sir Lancelot would fall for with a single glance...

**Artoria:**
Hm? Your side's Lancelot, are they a young lady like da Vinci?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pfffft! (spit take)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You could say something like that!


---

**Oberon:**
Mm, that's great. Da Vinci seems to be a truly reliable Servant.

**Oberon:**
Well, I'll guess I'll leave this area to you. As a matter of fact, I have a huge amount of stuff I need to work on.

**Tristan:**
Oberon...? Are you saying you're leaving us?

**Oberon:**
Yeah. I'll try and get some information on this Mash girl too.

**Oberon:**
You need some information on Britain in general, as well.

**Oberon:**
Britain is definitely going to undergo some changes, thanks to the arrival of Chaldea.

**Oberon:**
You don't have many allies here. And you need to know what's going on in every region.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll meet again soon, right?|


---

**Oberon:**
Of course. If I come here, I can see you all.

**Oberon:**
I'll bring some good news with me next time. Until then, you all need to get used to Britain.

**Da Vinci:**
Oh, he's already gone.

**Da Vinci:**
He's dependable, but he really marches to the beat of his own drum, doesn't he?

**Tristan:**
Yes...such a glamorous outfit...I understand...

**Tristan:**
I am overjoyed...we are kindred poets, without a doubt...

**Artoria:**
Um...so what are we going to do now? I can show you around Salisbury.

**Da Vinci:**
No, everyone needs to rest today. You walked all the way here, didn't you?

**Da Vinci:**
Come on, upstairs, upstairs.

**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru takes one room, while Tristan and I take the second.

**Da Vinci:**
And Artoria can have the one I prepared for Mash.

**Da Vinci:**
Good thing I was greedy enough to get three. The rooms are also secured with magic barriers.

**Da Vinci:**
They're completely soundproof. You're in safe hands.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Da Vinci is winking at me...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I see, we'll continue this in my room...)


---

**Artoria:**
Ah! Um, is it alright if I have it to myself (and free of charge)?

**Artoria:**
Yay, I've always wanted my own room! Gonna go rest, gonna go rest, gonna go rest!

**Artoria:**
Thank you, da Vinci!

**Artoria:**
Wooow, such generous fairies! Pan-human History is amazing!

**Da Vinci:**
She's gone...

**Da Vinci:**
I didn't mention it out of consideration for her, but she's different from the “Artoria” we know.

**Tristan:**
Yes. Pan-human history's King of Britain...

**Tristan:**
King Arthur...it seems like she should be considered a completely different person from Artoria Pendragon...

**Da Vinci:**
Mm. Let's bear that in mind and change our discussion. Can you two head upstairs?

**Da Vinci:**
Something might happen here. We have to keep our discussion of pan-human history between ourselves.

**Da Vinci:**
Right, I'll begin with what I know. First, concerning this Fairy Kingdom of Britain.

**Da Vinci:**
Now that you've been to Salisbury, you've seen the state of the island yourselves, but...

**Da Vinci:**
This Lostbelt is different from the previous ones, to a great degree.

**Da Vinci:**
I really don't think it's “human history that diverged at a specific branch point.”

**Da Vinci:**
As you can see, humankind doesn't reign as the dominant species. Fundamentally, it's a world of nothing but fairies.

**Da Vinci:**
Russia was a world where humanity was unable to survive due to a massive ice age, and was forced to evolve accordingly.

**Da Vinci:**
Scandinavia was a world where the Age of Gods concluded in Ragnarok, and humanity declined alongside the gods.

**Da Vinci:**
China was ruled by the one true man and became a one-nation world in perpetuity.

**Da Vinci:**
India was a world that attempted to converge with perfection by endlessly repeating the “saṃsāra of the world” rather than “saṃsāra of humans.”

**Da Vinci:**
Greece was a world where humanity was under the complete control of gods who never perished.

**Da Vinci:**
Each had ceased to develop any further, but they were still fundamentally worlds of mankind.

**Da Vinci:**
No matter how far they deviated from us, they were building an anthroposphere that ran parallel to the global environment of 2017.

**Da Vinci:**
But this Britain is different. It's not a “world of mankind” to begin with.

**Da Vinci:**
Becuase, as you can see, there is nothing “outside of Britain.”

**Da Vinci:**
It's not like up to now, where the view of the outside world was blocked by a wall of storms.

**Da Vinci:**
There's really nothing beyond the island here. The five continents and all other nations don't exist.

**Da Vinci:**
So long as we're in this Lostbelt, the only things on Earth are Great Britain and the ocean.

**Da Vinci:**
Meaning&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An "alternate world" unrelated to human history?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yup. Right now, that's what I'd have to say.

**Da Vinci:**
I've spent the last few days asking around about the situations with other countries, but nobody knows what a “foreign country” even is.

**Da Vinci:**
The Fairy Kingdom of Britain has some kind of bizarre secret forming the basis of its creation.

**Da Vinci:**
Uncovering it is the key to conquering this Lostbelt... no, it'll probably tie everything together.

**Tristan:**
Hold on. If no other European countries exist, then...

**Tristan:**
Will the fairies in this land be ones solely unique to Britain?

**Da Vinci:**
Good question, Tristan.

**Da Vinci:**
If there are no other regions, there's no reason for folklore from specific regions to be introduced to Britain...

**Da Vinci:**
But, that's the convergence of human history, right?

**Da Vinci:**
If a fairy originally came from Earth, then it still came to be even if their form and particulars differ.

**Da Vinci:**
In this Fairy Kingdom, fairies found in European folklore have arisen in different forms.

**Da Vinci:**
I guess you could call it a similar ecosystem.

**Da Vinci:**
If the environment is Earth, the civilizations, events, and the life that appears can be similar.

**Tristan:**
A similarity rises... you say?

**Da Vinci:**
Yes. The Fairy Kingdom of Britain is completely different from the Britain we know.

**Da Vinci:**
But, even in such a different world, there are many overlaps.

**Da Vinci:**
Such as the names of cities or fairies.

**Da Vinci:**
Or the name of the Queen who rules this world.

**Da Vinci:**
Did you see that huge castle to the north on the way here? That's the castle of Queen Morgan, the ruler of these lands.

**Da Vinci:**
The castle's name is Camelot.

**Da Vinci:**
In pan-human history, the castle became the setting for “King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table,”  and Britain's symbol of peace.

**Da Vinci:**
And it was Morgan who was credited with defeating King Arthur and indirectly bringing Britain to ruin.

**Da Vinci:**
She is the most powerful, most evil witch in Britain.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I've heard of her before we came here, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Morgan, the witch


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. As far as my investigations can tell, Morgan has dominated this land for close to 2,000 years.

**Da Vinci:**
A long time ago, there used to be six lords in Britain. Nowadays they're called “clans.”

**Da Vinci:**
Wind, Earth, Fang, Mirror, Wing, and one other. For thousands of years, they've continuously rivaled each other.

**Da Vinci:**
Using black magic, Morgan defeated them, and unified Britain with half the clans by force.

**Da Vinci:**
Afterwards, Morgan granted the humans a certain degree of freedom,

**Da Vinci:**
and, apparently it took 2,000 years to create this copycat civilization.

**Tristan:**
Morgan...to do such things, even in a Lostbelt...

**Tristan:**
No. I'm sure it's not the same Morgan we know, but...

**Tristan:**
So, how is her rule? She went as far as to name her castle Camelot.

**Tristan:**
Does she rule as justly and unashamedly as King Arthur?

**Da Vinci:**
It's absolutely awful!

**Da Vinci:**
Morgan dominates the fairies and imposes strict control over the number of human births.

**Da Vinci:**
The fairies living in the cities are obligated to be inscribed with Morgan's curse&mdash;a Command Spell.

**Da Vinci:**
Once a year, the fairies tattooed with this Command Spell are forced to “offer” their life force.

**Da Vinci:**
It's called the “existence tax” in the Fairy Kingdom. It's basically their magical energy and vitality.

**Da Vinci:**
The fairies who fail to amass enough magical energy to satisfy Morgan over the course of a year, well, they just die on the spot.

**Da Vinci:**
It seems that when Morgan took the throne, she said to the fairies:

**Da Vinci:**
“I will not pardon you. I will not save you.”

**Da Vinci:**
“Merely obey. Hang your heads. I will protect Britain through absolute subservience.”

**Da Vinci:**
Fairies who can't stand for this or who can't work are taken to Camelot for disposal.

**Da Vinci:**
Either that or they flee the cities, to escape to a place where nobody knows them, so it seems.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An annual existence tax...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see, so...


---

**Tristan:**
An oppressive regime will give rise to forces of opposition...

**Tristan:**
In spite of this, this Britain has remained under Morgan's control for 2,000 years?

**Da Vinci:**
I guess that shows just how powerful Morgan is.

**Da Vinci:**
You see, she collects half the life force of fairies living in Britain every year.

**Da Vinci:**
None of the fairies can stand against her. Be that as it may, Morgan's rule isn't all bad.

**Da Vinci:**
Look, that weird black thing you fought on the beach? The fairies call it “Mors,” but...

**Da Vinci:**
They say it's the first in a series of Calamities plaguing Great Britain since the island's creation.

**Da Vinci:**
A fairy that has lost their purpose. A fairy that has lost their radiance.

**Da Vinci:**
Among fairies like these, there are a few that become Mors.

**Da Vinci:**
From the fairies' point of view, the Mors are their natural enemy.

**Da Vinci:**
All it takes is a touch for the Mors to spread, then that fairy will become a Mors as well.

**Da Vinci:**
It's like a disease only fairies can contract.

**Da Vinci:**
Mors were the first, but many other Calamities spring up periodically in Britain.

**Da Vinci:**
Morgan...the Queen's military are constantly driving these calamities back.

**Da Vinci:**
Morgan is a cold-hearted tyrant, while at the same time being the sword that protects Britain.

**Da Vinci:**
The fairies fear and despise her, but at the same time they rely on her rule...

**Da Vinci:**
And that sums up the current state of the Fairy Kingdom.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, as expected, Morgan is the Lostbelt King?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. There's no mistaking it. Our objective, Rhongomyniad...

**Da Vinci:**
That great magic that reached Olympus. Morgan is the only one who could have unleashed it.

**Da Vinci:**
Of course, that would mean that Beryl Gut is involved with Morgan,

**Da Vinci:**
and we're not going to get as much as the time of day to peacefully negotiate with her!

**Tristan:**
I understand. So we must overthrow Morgan for our own reasons.

**Da Vinci:**
Aah! But it's said to be impossible to enter Camelot without the Queen's permission!

**Da Vinci:**
Nevertheless, Morgan's rule is not absolute. Right now, a new hope has been born in Britain.

**Da Vinci:**
We arrived at the turning point for the Fairy Kingdom of Britain...the best opportunity has turned up.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What new hope?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
The “Child of Prophecy.”

**Da Vinci:**
Before they disappeared, the chief of the now-extinct Mirror Clan devised a prophecy.

**Da Vinci:**
In a nutshell, it's this:

**Da Vinci:**
“Sixteen years from now, a savior will appear. Guided by the Staff of Selection, the true king will be crowned.”

**Da Vinci:**
“When the six bells toll, the false queen will be overthrown. With fairies and humans together, the false history will end.”

**Da Vinci:**
Well? Have you heard this somewhere?

**Da Vinci:**
It's quite credible. After all, the Mirror Clan's predictions are never off the mark.

**Da Vinci:**
The Queen's been rounding up and imprisoning all the fairies that turn 16 this year, but...

**Da Vinci:**
The hunt for the Child of Prophecy continues. It's proof they haven't found them yet.

**Da Vinci:**
Between the Mors and the Child, the Queen's rule is looking pretty shaky right now.

**Da Vinci:**
If we make good use of this, it might not be impossible to negotiate with Morgan.

**Da Vinci:**
Be that as it may, our first priority now is finding Mash. First you need to rest and recover your strength.

**Da Vinci:**
Starting tomorrow we'll gather some information. Naturally, let's try to be as inconspicuous as possible.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Been a long time since I've had a soft bed...|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The British Lostbelt...Queen Morgan...|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria...Oberon...|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash...please stay safe&mdash;|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Well, let's get some rest as well, shall we?

**Da Vinci:**
Sleep isn't necessary for Servants, but it's exhausting to constantly be on alert, right?

**Da Vinci:**
You never took your fingers off your bowstrings even once. As expected of a Knight of the Round Table, eh Tristan?

**Tristan:**
Hm...I must need rest as well, to have been seen through like that...

**Tristan:**
But there will be other opportunities.

**Tristan:**
It is you who must rest, da Vinci. You may be a Servant as well, but,

**Tristan:**
you are a living organism right now, the same as Fujimaru.

**Tristan:**
Please rest, and do not overwork yourself. My duty is to watch over you both.

**Da Vinci:**
Is that so? As you wish, then. As expected of the most beautiful man of the Round Table, Tristan the Lamenting.

**Da Vinci:**
Thank you. I'll take you up on your offer. To be honest, I'm exhausted.

**Tristan:**
Please do. However, before that...

**Tristan:**
I have a favor to ask. It will take but a moment before you fall asleep...

**Tristan:**
The records of the Sixth Singularity.

**Tristan:**
The deeds done by the “me” who was summoned in the Holy City of Camelot&mdash;

**Tristan:**
Could you please tell me what those were?

## Section 3: Aurora 

**Artoria:**
Good morning, everybody! Ah, the bed was sooooooo comfortable!

**Da Vinci:**
Good, good, changing the bedding was worth the time. I'm glad you're happy with it.

**Da Vinci:**
These fairy beds just imitate the shape of one, so the cushions are usually hard as a ro~ck.

**Tristan:**
Tristan, at your service. If you so desire, I can play a waking tune, or something similar...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Morning, everyone.|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's hit the streets and gather some intel!

**Da Vinci:**
Woah, someone's raring to go. However, you should dial it back a little bit.

**Da Vinci:**
There may not be many of the Queen's soldiers in Salisbury, but there are quite a few of her sympathizers.

**Da Vinci:**
Just act natural, alright?


---

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Dabinchi, are you going out?! You're not going to wait tables with your pretty skates!?

**Da Vinci:**
Sorry, just a bit of sightseeing~! I'll help out this afternoon!

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
O-oh...that's right, that was the promise.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
You guys! I don't know what clan you're from, but don't work Dabinchi too hard!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Oh?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Hm? What is it, Fujimaru? Something on your mind?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, the sky...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's the same as yesterday...


---

**Da Vinci:**
Oh, that. I was surprised at first, too.

**Da Vinci:**
The weather here doesn't change. There's just this sky, and the night.

**Da Vinci:**
It seems to rain too. There's nothing in this world that clears the air and shows the blue sky.

**Artoria:**
Huh? Blue sky&mdash;does the sky really turn blue in your Britain!?

**Tristan:**
Yes. A beautiful, clear sky, completely unblemished. Of course, the sky of this land is beautiful also.

**Artoria:**
Huh...blue, the color of bluebell flowers, right? I can't believe it turns that color...wow...

**Artoria:**
It must be a very bright and colourful world.

**Artoria:**
I bet no matter how hard life is, everyone helps each other with a smile.

**Artoria:**
Anyway, shall we start gathering information?

**Artoria:**
I'm Fujimaru's master, right?

**Artoria:**
Alright, let's get into gear. Where should we head first?

**Artoria:**
They won't let you in a Woodwose-branded store without a squire, right?

**Da Vinci:**
Oh, it doesn't matter. As long as we look like a gathering of fairies.

**Da Vinci:**
Well then, let's observe the current state of affairs while pretending to be out for a walk.

**Da Vinci:**
We'll listen in on gossip, and occasionally join in on some of it.

**Fang Fairy:**
Do I know any fairies in iron armor, you say? What, are you all interested in the Queen's army?

**Fang Fairy:**
Whoa, stop right there. There's no good to be had joining the Queen's army now!

**Fang Fairy:**
After all, this is the year that Ainsel predicted, the year of salvation, the year when the Child of Prophecy would appear!

**Fang Fairy:**
Maybe if they give the Queen a hard time, she'll lower her taxes a little!

**Fang Fairy:**
Eh, that's not it? You got separated? Ah, I see. I have no clue.

**Earth Fairy:**
Metal armor? You won't find that here. If it's iron you're after, you should head to Norwich.

**Earth Fairy:**
Unless Spriggan closed the mine, they should still be making those silly weapons.

**Earth Fairy:**
What kind of weapons? Well naturally, they're swords and spears, axes and bows.

**Earth Fairy:**
Jeez, what's it come to these days, fairies using iron weapons...

**Earth Fairy:**
What the heck is the Queen doing...?

**Earth Fairy:**
But it's only for a little bit longer, right? The Child of Prophecy will take care of it all somehow.

**Wind Fairy:**
Hey, have you guys heard? There's some kind of disaster brewing in Norwich.

**Wind Fairy:**
The sky above Norwich is pitch-black and gloomy, even during the day.

**Wind Fairy:**
With the big “Calamity Pool” rearing its ugly head, Norwich is done for.

**Wind Fairy:**
A noisy city of iron and soot. A hangout for dirty humans. Norwich deserves to just disappear...

**Wind Fairy:**
Ahh, how worrisome.

**Wind Fairy:**
Maybe the fairies escaping Norwich will come to our city.

**Wind Fairy:**
I don't want any more from the Earth Clan in historic Salisbury...

**Wind Fairy:**
But Lady Aurora is too kind...she'll probably just accept them...

**Fairy In the Form of a Bird:**
You're looking for someone? You mean in Salisbury? Or in all of Britain?

**Fairy In the Form of a Bird:**
Hahaha. If it's all of Britain, that's a lot to ask of the fairies here.

**Fairy In the Form of a Bird:**
Salisbury is too comfortable, so people don't want to go outside.

**Fairy In the Form of a Bird:**
If you want to know about other cities, you have to get out there. Oh, but you guys don't have wings.

**Fairy In the Form of a Bird:**
You won't get far that way, the Mors will get you!

**Fairy In the Form of a Bird:**
More importantly, I wonder what tonight's festival will be? Maybe they'll put on another production of “The Wicked Witch and the Child of Prophecy”!

**Fairy In the Form of a Bird:**
I love that one! It's great when the Queen and her damn knights get beaten up!

**Artoria:**
... (exhausted)

**Da Vinci:**
... (sick of this)

**Tristan:**
... (depressed)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How disappointing...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We barely got anything...


---

**Da Vinci:**
Well, I never thought we'd find any leads in a single day.

**Da Vinci:**
Everybody's talking about the Child of Prophecy and nothing else, so they're not listening to us seriously.

**Tristan:**
Yes...in the end, we were even asked to buy Child of Prophecy merchandise...

**Tristan:**
It is a fever, everywhere we go. As if it were Christmas.

**Tristan:**
The Child of Prophecy boom...it reeks of great profit...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I guess that's what everyone is hoping for.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Child of Prophecy...just who could they be...


---

**Artoria:**
Uhm...

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Everyone's obsessed with the Child of Prophecy, and the only other gossip is whatever's going on in Norwich to the east.

**Da Vinci:**
All this talk has gotten me curious. What kind of fairy is the Child of Prophecy?

**Da Vinci:**
If the prophecy is right, they want to fight Morgan. So if we play our cards right, we might be able to cooperate.

**Da Vinci:**
Well? Should we try looking for them while we search for Mash?

**Da Vinci:**
The fairies sure have high expectations. They must be someone really strong and gallant!

**Artoria:**
...

**C：Voices from the Entrance:**
Everyone, I'm back to bother you one day later! Oh wow...there's not very many customers today.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Over here!


---

**Oberon:**
Hey. I spent the morning walking the streets, is it really already lunchtime? Anyway&mdash;

**Oberon:**
That seems like it'd be fun. If that's the plan, let me join in too.

**Oberon:**
Since I'm bad at fighting, my specialty is buttering people up. I'm a peacemaker.

**Oberon:**
That's it! So much that, I'll show you how to get on Artoria's good side.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What do you mean?|


---

**Oberon:**
Oh, you haven't told them yet, Artoria?

**Oberon:**
You see, she's your Child of Prophecy.

**Oberon:**
I thought that would be pretty obvious, since you know, she has the same name as King Arthur.

**Da Vinci:**
Well, I thought that might be the case given the name Artoria, but...

**Da Vinci:**
Is that for real, Artoria!? Because, well&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
To put it mildly, your magical energy is below average for fairies, isn't it!?

**Da Vinci:**
Your Magic Circuits, or would they be Divine Patterns since you're a fairy? Anyway, they're better than a human's but worse than a fairy's.

**Da Vinci:**
Even Mike's are stronger! And despite this, you're the Child supposed to defeat the Queen!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(That's right...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I kinda know how that feels...)


---

**Artoria:**
Y-y-yes, you're absolutely right!

**Artoria:**
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I have the Staff of Selection, so I'm sorry!

**Artoria:**
B-b-but it's not like that makes me the Child of Prophecy...

**Artoria:**
I don't have the determination, drive, or character to fight the Queen in the first place, and...

**Artoria:**
I'm not a clan fairy...and because I don't have much magical energy, I have no choice but to somehow fake it with magecraft...

**Artoria:**
They told me to ring the bell, but I can't even get near it...

**Artoria:**
But I'm doing my best, I feel...I feel...yes...

**Artoria:**
But the reality is, it's really hard to do...haha... why did it have to be me?

**Tristan:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't think you can, Artoria?|


---

**Artoria:**
I don't know...it's just...

**Artoria:**
If I really am the Child of Prophecy, I have a way to fight, or so I think.

**Artoria:**
I was born and raised to do this.

**Artoria:**
&mdash;That's what I try and tell myself, but I'm too useless for anything like that...!

**Artoria:**
The last time I came to Salisbury, I tried to speak to the head of the Wind Clan,

**Artoria:**
but nobody listened to me, so I headed to Manchester next...!

**Da Vinci:**
I see...so that's why you didn't say anything... Fairies can tell the amount and strength of someone's magical energy with a single glance...

**Da Vinci:**
If Artoria said she was the Child of Prophecy, they'd just laugh in her face...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They'd yell at her to stop lying...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They'd scold her for screwing around...


---

**Artoria:**
Yes. That's why I thought I would ask a clan head for approval first...

**Artoria:**
But I was turned away at the door...

**Oberon:**
Hmm. The head of the Wind Clan is Aurora, right?

**--SECTION BREAK--:**

**Oberon:**
I much prefer the current Artoria. But if you'd rather act like a big shot instead, then so be it.

**Oberon:**
If that's the entire scope of the problem, let's resolve it with haste.

**Tristan:**
Hm? Are you implying that you have a solution, Oberon?

**Oberon:**
That's what I said. I can get you an audience with Aurora.

**Oberon:**
See, wasn't it easy to get in? This is the bell tower at the heart of Salisbury.

**Oberon:**
The oldest building in the Fairy Kingdom, the Cathedral of Tonelico!

**Oberon:**
Let's head on upstairs, boys and girls. Aurora's room is on the top floor.

**Oberon:**
I've already delivered the news, so the guards shouldn't&mdash;whoa, there.

**E：???:**
Welcome, King of the Autumn Woods. Your visit is unexpected, but since it is you, you are welcome to come in.

**E：???:**
However, this is a sacred place for the coronation of new rulers.

**E：???:**
The place where Her Majesty Queen Morgan was crowned 2,000 years ago.

**E：???:**
To allow in a lower being such as a human, even if they are a squire&mdash;

**E：???:**
No matter how favored you are by Lady Aurora, such a thing cannot be permitted.

**E：???:**
Guards, this way. Seize the fairies of unknown affiliation, and the disgusting human.

**E：???:**
If they surrender peacefully, wonderful. If the human tries to escape, it does not matter if you dispose of them.

**E：???:**
Needless to say, the same goes for Oberon. There is no need to treat him any differently.

**E：???:**
We've received letters of protest from shops all over the city, saying “he needs to pay his bill, as soon as possible.”

**Oberon:**
Eh? Well, this is heading in a different direction than I planned for...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
OBERON!!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Does he actually hate us?)


---

**F：Sentinel:**
If that is your order, I shall obey, but...are you sure, Mistress Coral?

**F：Sentinel:**
Lady Aurora seemed quite happy, and said to let him through immediately, but...

**E：Coral:**
I do not suffer opinions. Even if you were chosen to be sentinels, you are all mere humans.

**E：Coral:**
Know your place. Or do you want to be turned into a rabbit right here?

**F：Sentinel:**
As you say. I'm extremely sorry, Lord Oberon.

**F：Sentinel:**
This is also my duty...please excuse any violence.

**Tristan:**
The number of opponents does not appear to be a serious threat, but it seems we cannot avoid combat.

**Tristan:**
Let's go, Fujimaru. Show them our might.

**--BATTLE--:**

**Oberon:**
How's that, Coral!? This is our true power!

**Oberon:**
Underestimate the penniless prince and this human at your own peril!

**Artoria:**
(Oberon was just cheering us on in the back, though.)

**Coral:**
...

**Coral:**
I see. It certainly seems that this human is no small fry.

**Coral:**
Lady Aurora loves unusual things. It is what gives Lady Aurora her power.

**Coral:**
I shall grant you a special audience with her. However, do not get carried away.

**Coral:**
“Something unusual” remains so only the first time you encounter it. Once you have become accustomed to it, the value that lies within is lost.

**Coral:**
Such audiences are granted rarely. Do not waste this good fortune.

**Aurora:**
Hello, Oberon. What story have you brought me today?

**Aurora:**
You're very well-informed, so I'm sure it's a wonderful tale.

**Aurora:**
I greatly look forward to it. It has been nothing but gloom recently...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(So...beautiful...!)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This radiance is too much to look at...


---

**Oberon:**
Mm. There's one tale someone in your position can't ignore, and one favor I have to ask.

**Oberon:**
Two things in total, but they won't take much time. But first, can I be selfish for a moment?

**Oberon:**
I'd like this to be a secret between you and me. You don't mind, do you?

**Aurora:**
My, how brazen. I am weak to scary stories...fufu.

**Aurora:**
A little thrill might be fun. &mdash;Coral. Would you excuse us for a moment?

**Coral:**
Lady Aurora!

**Aurora:**
Worry not, these people can be trusted. And that trust should be mutual, no?

**Coral:**
Of course... Should you change your mind, please call for me right away.

**Aurora:**
Please forgive Coral. She is a proud girl, but rather rigid.

**Aurora:**
I'm sure she gave you another stern welcome, did she not? I am glad you escaped injury.

**Aurora:**
Greetings, guests of Oberon. I am Aurora, leader of the Wind Clan.

**Aurora:**
I am the Lord of Salisbury. &mdash;What would you ask of me today?

**Da Vinci:**
(Oooh...the atmosphere changed in a heartbeat. Her leadership stems from more than just her pretty face, I guess?)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Actually...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're having trouble finding someone.


---

**Aurora:**
&mdash;Oh my. Oh my, oh my, oh my!

**Aurora:**
It has been so many years since a human has spoken to me so freely!

**Aurora:**
What is your name, my dear? Could you be a free citizen? What is your pedigree&mdash;ah.

**Aurora:**
My apologies, {(M) he /(F) she} is your squire. How impolite of me.

**Oberon:**
Aurora. You really ought to work on your bad habit of rushing to protect every weak human you see.

**Oberon:**
Keep that up, and eventually you'll have every human in Britain living in Salisbury.

**Oberon:**
The faction of the Wind Clan that's for coexistence is really only you, isn't it? Aren't you under some heavy criticism for that?

**Aurora:**
You are right, but...

**Aurora:**
I...I just couldn't deny {(M) his /(F) her} puppy-dog eyes...you know?

**Oberon:**
Good grief. Well, that's the reason I brought {(M) him /(F) her} here in the first place.

**Oberon:**
I told you before about the world of pan-human history, and the group calling themselves Chaldea.

**Oberon:**
{(M) He /(F) She}'s a Master from Chaldea. The two back there aren't fairies, but Servants.

**Da Vinci:**
&mdash;Oberon.

**Oberon:**
It's alright, she may be from the Fairy Kingdom, but her thoughts are more along the lines of us pan-human history fairies.

**Oberon:**
She'd never say it herself, but she wants to change the way things are in the Kingdom.

**Oberon:**
Isn't that right, Aurora? It's been 2,000 years since Britain fell under Morgan's rule.

**Oberon:**
You've seen a lot happen since then, in all shapes and sizes.

**Oberon:**
You think Morgan's rule should end.

**Oberon:**
I saw the hope in your eyes when I told you about the outside world before.

**Oberon:**
Fujimaru came here to defeat Morgan.

**Oberon:**
{(M) He /(F) She} doesn't care about what comes afterwards. {(M) He /(F) She} isn't interested in ruling in place of Morgan.

**Oberon:**
And after {(M) he /(F) she} leaves, whether or not Britain falls into ruin will be up to its people.

**Oberon:**
Chaldea won't care about your efforts to save a collapsing Britain.

**Oberon:**
They won't stand in your way. From the beginning, their only objective has been Morgan.

**Aurora:**
So it seems...

**Aurora:**
The young lady behind you has a grave look upon her face, but that {(M) child /(F) girl} does not deny your words.

**Aurora:**
Travellers from a world different than ours... a properly advanced Britain...

**Aurora:**
Something so unbelievable, so suddenly, but...

**Aurora:**
This may also be Ainsel's guidance. Yes. Those in trouble should help each other.

**Aurora:**
Fujimaru, was it?

**Aurora:**
Even though you may be hostile to this land, I shall allow your conduct in Salisbury.

**Aurora:**
If you are searching for someone, I shall allow you to use the eyes of the Wind Clan in the other cities.

**Aurora:**
Oxford, Gloucester, New Darlington, and Camelot.

**Aurora:**
Norwich is the only place I cannot contact my clan, but we shall help search for your friend.

**Aurora:**
Please tell Coral what this person looks like once we are done here. I do hope we may be of assistance.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you so much...!|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But, is this really alright...?

**Aurora:**
You ask if I am truly willing to help you?

**Aurora:**
Hehe. You are so honest, and yet so kind, Fujimaru.

**Aurora:**
It is true that for those who call this land home, cooperating with you may not be in their best interests.

**Aurora:**
However, I think our...current state of being is more important than the survival of our kingdom.

**Aurora:**
Her Majesty is a very capable ruler, however...

**Aurora:**
If we leave things the way they are, there will be grave consequences...


---

**Oberon:**
Be that as it may, our cooperation must be kept a secret for the time being.

**Oberon:**
If it became known that Lady Aurora was working with Chaldea, Morgan would likely massacre the entire Wind Clan.

**Oberon:**
Therefore, we shall keep this under wraps. And if push comes to shove, we can just deny all knowledge of each other.

**Artoria:**
Kill them all...even the leader of the Wind Clan can't defeat Queen Morgan face-to-face?

**Aurora:**
No, I cannot. We all live and die at the mercy of the Queen.

**Artoria:**
I-I see...Queen Morgan is amazing...

**Aurora:**
She is quite a special fairy.

**Aurora:**
The prophecy Ainsel left behind mentions only the “Child of Prophecy” can defeat her.

**Aurora:**
However, the Child has still not appeared... and we need their assistance as soon as possible.

**Oberon:**
(Heheheh, that's not a good face...)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ah...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(He's gonna do it...Oberon's really gonna do it!)


---

**Oberon:**
Yes, that is indeed the case, Aurora! It's funny you should say that, because there is a fairy I'd like to introduce you to!

**Artoria:**
W-wait a mo&ndash;! P-please, please stop, Oberon!

**Oberon:**
To tell you the truth, Artoria from Tintagel here is your shining star of hope!

**Oberon:**
Bearing the real Staff of Selection, and here to oust Morgan, the genuine Child of Prophecy!

**Oberon:**
Come on down!

**Artoria:**
O-B-E-R-O-N!!!!!

**Aurora:**
You're all fun and games, Oberon. I'd love for you to give me such an introduction one day as well.

**Oberon:**
Why thank you. I didn't expect to be so muzzled by such a direct attack, either.

**Oberon:**
But if I didn't do something like this, Artoria would have never spoken up. She's a bit of a late bloomer, you see.

**Oberon:**
She's still not confident she's the Child of Prophecy. So, would you mind giving her your stamp of approval?

**Oberon:**
Like, say&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ringing the bell, like in the prophecy?|


---

**Artoria:**
!!!!?

**Oberon:**
(whistle) Even I didn't think of going that far. Nice work.

**Aurora:**
No...I cannot allow that.

**Aurora:**
Indeed, there is a bell tower above this room. That bell is the voice of the Wind Clan.

**Aurora:**
If that bell is rung, it is a symbol of my acknowledgement.

**Aurora:**
It is not something that can be accomplished with words alone. You must have true ability and proof.

**Aurora:**
Artoria, is it? The prophecy also speaks of the Staff of Selection.

**Aurora:**
I do not know the implication of the Staff of Selection.

**Aurora:**
Ainsel, the Mirror head, knew the meaning. But she disappeared, and her clan's whereabouts remain unknown.

**Aurora:**
Therefore...allow me to discern your qualities as King with my own eyes and heart.

**Tristan:**
Determine her qualities as King...? What do you mean, specifically?

**Aurora:**
Oh my, what a cool voice you have. I was certain you were unable to speak.

**Aurora:**
In consideration of your lovely voice, I shall lay out my terms.

**Aurora:**
Artoria. Fujimaru. The two of you, I ask you to show me hope.

**Aurora:**
A sign that Britain can be changed, the dark fate that afflicts us all&mdash;

**Aurora:**
The Calamity that arises once every one hundred years. The curse that even Queen Morgan herself cannot dispel.

**Aurora:**
Several months ago, the “Calamity Pool”, a powerful Mors Current, began engulfing the port city of Norwich.

**Aurora:**
If you can cleanse this, I shall gladly give you Salisbury's bell.

**--ARROW--:**

**Oberon:**
Cleansing the calamity of Norwich, huh...that's certainly one way to break the ice.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What did she mean, the "Calamity of Norwich"?|


---

**Oberon:**
I don't know much about these Calamities either. I've never seen one happen.

**Oberon:**
But I've heard the stories. Every one hundred years, a natural disaster occurs in this Fairy Kingdom.

**Da Vinci:**
I've heard about these Calamities, too. I've already explained it to Fujimaru.

**Da Vinci:**
Norwich, a port town to the east of Britain, has been showing signs of trouble for several months now.

**Da Vinci:**
The story goes, that black soot is soaring up and accumulating, like a rain cloud.

**Tristan:**
Aurora said that if you can excise the impending Calamity, she'll give you the Bell of Salisbury.

**Artoria:**
Cleansing clouds...I was never taught that sort of magecraft...

**Oberon:**
Yeah, no big deal. Let's put Norwich on the back burner for the time being.

**Oberon:**
There's a limit to what we can accomplish. More importantly, our priority lies with finding Mash.

**Oberon:**
We got Aurora's cooperation, so give it two or three days and we should be hearing some news.

**Oberon:**
You can wait at the inn until then.

**Oberon:**
Or maybe not. It's a waste of time to be sitting twiddling our thumbs.

**Oberon:**
I'll send you a list of errands later. You can undertake them to get some money and collect information.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you going off somewhere again?


---

**Oberon:**
I've got a few things I need to tend to. Coral's been giving me a hard time, and I have lots of debts to repay.

**Oberon:**
Then I guess we're all done here. I'll see you both in three days, in good form!

**Oberon:**
Now then... Since everyone's resting here in Salisbury for a bit longer,

**Oberon:**
they should be kept busy for a while. I have to find out what's going on in Norwich.

**Oberon:**
Whoa, welcome back, Blanca. How were things up north?

**Oberon:**
Tell me, how far has Knocknarea's army advanced?

**Oberon:**
Wha&mdash;another Child of Prophecy has appeared!?

**Oberon:**
That's...completely unexpected. It's not even a part of Ainsel's prophecy.

**Oberon:**
More importantly, Artoria's position will be in jeopardy. It's going to be a race against the clock...

**Oberon:**
Hmm? Is Artoria the real deal, you ask? Of course. She's definitely the Child of Prophecy.

**Oberon:**
But at this point, it isn't about which one is the genuine article. It's about which one the fairies choose to trust.

**Oberon:**
Well, let's think of the positives.

**Oberon:**
If a false Child of Prophecy has appeared in the north, Morgan's attention will be drawn there.

**Oberon:**
Artoria and Fujimaru will be safe for a while.

**Oberon:**
In the meantime, they both need to grow up a bit. It's way too early to send them to Norwich.

**Oberon:**
They'll need the ability to deal with and come out on top of Britain through their own experience, not just with words.

**Oberon:**
“You're taking it too easy,” you say? Haha, you're so relentless, Blanca.

**Oberon:**
But we can't rush the beginning of a story. It was the same for us, wasn't it?

**Artoria:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria, are you unwell?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you worried about what was just said?


---

**Artoria:**
No, it's just not every day you get to talk to the head of a clan, so I was a little nervous. Haha...

**Artoria:**
I'm sorry. I've got a lot on my mind right now, so I'm going to take the rest of the day off!

**Artoria:**
I'll meet you back here in the morning! Bye!

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm...apparently, we need to change our perception of her as well.

**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, Tristan, let's go back upstairs.

**Da Vinci:**
We need to discuss our plans while it's still safe to do so.

**Da Vinci:**
All right, this should be okay...

**Da Vinci:**
Reporting on the events to date, Familiar Tifone, go~!

**Da Vinci:**
I've made my report and sent it to the Storm Border. It'll be a couple of days before we hear anything.

**Da Vinci:**
Now, let's review what we've been through so far. And, Morgan's not the topic of discussion today...

**Tristan:**
The Child of Prophecy, who is foretold to be the one to defeat Queen Morgan...you mean her, don't you?

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. To tell you the truth, I think we've been a little careless around her.

**Da Vinci:**
Since the only thing they have in common is their name, I hadn't put a great deal of thought into it, but she is without a doubt the King Arthur of this Lostbelt.

**Da Vinci:**
Chaldea confronted the legend of King Arthur once already, in the Sixth Singularity.

**Da Vinci:**
Let me briefly summarize the legend of King Arthur as a refresher.

**Da Vinci:**
It was in Great Britain during the fifth century. The country was in a state of upheaval.

**Da Vinci:**
The genesis of that was the collapse of the Roman Empire on the mainland. Britain's power under the protection of the Empire was waning,

**Da Vinci:**
and the foreign tribe of the Saxons invaded from across the sea.

**Da Vinci:**
Britain was an island nation governed by many kings and their tribes.

**Da Vinci:**
Despite the constant quarreling between the tribes, and the conflicts with the Picts in the north of the island,

**Da Vinci:**
the tribal kings cooperated with each other.

**Da Vinci:**
But, one of those kings fractured this unity.

**Da Vinci:**
This king announced that he would unify Britain, using the many different tribes as tools to accomplish this.

**Da Vinci:**
His name was Vortigern.

**Da Vinci:**
The man said to be the personification of the white dragon,

**Da Vinci:**
born from within Britain to destroy it.

**Da Vinci:**
Vortigern invited the Saxons to the island, throwing it into chaos.

**Da Vinci:**
The fortress city of Londinium, the cornerstone of Britain constructed when the Empire ruled over the island, was destroyed.

**Da Vinci:**
Uther Pendragon, the greatest of all the kings, lost his life in combat with Vortigern.

**Da Vinci:**
Thus, Britain was plunged into the Dark Ages. Everyone living on the island foresaw inescapable doom.

**Da Vinci:**
However, hope was not lost.

**Da Vinci:**
The great sorcerer Merlin, protector of Britain and King Uther's advisor, told the people:

**Da Vinci:**
“This too, is all according to the prophecy.”

**Da Vinci:**
“King Uther's successor has been chosen. This person is the next king.”

**Da Vinci:**
“Whosoever draws the Sword of Selection from the stone, shall be the next King of Britain.”

**Da Vinci:**
Many knights laid their hands on the Sword of Selection, but none could pull it from the stone.

**Da Vinci:**
Eventually, all the knights gave up, and the Sword of Selection was abandoned as a pointless endeavour, but then...

**Da Vinci:**
The fifteen-year old child of King Uther, raised in secret as a squire,

**Da Vinci:**
managed to draw the Sword of Selection in secret after everyone else had left.

**Da Vinci:**
The name of that sword was Caliburn.

**Da Vinci:**
And that youth was the next King of Britain.

**Da Vinci:**
A knight among knights, Arthur Pendragon.

**Da Vinci:**
The Artoria Pendragon we all know and love.

**Da Vinci:**
King Arthur was proclaimed Uther's successor and proceeded to unite the lords.

**Da Vinci:**
She triumphed over the Saxons. She waged twelve battles against them, and won each in succession.

**Da Vinci:**
The ever-victorious, undefeated King of Knights.

**Da Vinci:**
However, the Saxons were not the only enemies. For the King of Knights, the greatest rivals were her own kin.

**Da Vinci:**
Vortigern, the incarnation of the white dragon who had thrown Britain into ruin and murdered King Uther.

**Da Vinci:**
The Witch Queen Morgan, who heard the will of the island and claimed the throne of Britain was hers by right.

**Da Vinci:**
The King of Knights lost Caliburn through Morgan's trickery, but was later granted an even greater holy sword by the fairies.

**Da Vinci:**
That was Excalibur. The holy sword forged in the Inner Sea of the planet.

**Da Vinci:**
In the world of magic, it's known as a Divine Construct, a decisive weapon meant to vanquish threats to the planet itself.

**Da Vinci:**
By becoming the wielder of this holy sword, King Arthur became Britain's savior in both name and substance.

**Da Vinci:**
After the decisive battle with Vortigern in the ruins of the fortress city of Londinium,

**Da Vinci:**
King Arthur built the White-Walled Castle, Camelot, with the help of the fairies.

**Da Vinci:**
Lords from all over the island gathered at the castle, and everyone who served the King of Knights sat at the Round Table, where all were of equal standing.

**Da Vinci:**
I can't believe I'm saying this in front of Tristan, but this was the founding of the Knights of the Round Table.

**Da Vinci:**
Lancelot, the knight from overseas France, who bore the blessing of the Lady of the Lake.

**Da Vinci:**
Gawain, blessed by the sun, heir to the northern lands of Orkney where the Witch Queen Morgan had married into.

**Da Vinci:**
Tristan, tragic prince to the Duke of Cornwall. Said to be the symbol of the Age of Romance.

**Tristan:**
Yes...the honorable Knights of the Round Table. My sworn friends of the thirteen seats.

**Tristan:**
Mighty Percival. Skillful Kay. Loyal Bedivere. Beneficent Gaheris.

**Tristan:**
Sunny Gareth. Dutiful Agravain. Palomides the Duelist. Taciturn Mordred.

**Tristan:**
And&mdash;the greatest of knights. The one chosen by the Holy Grail, Galahad of Revelations.

**Tristan:**
Aside from the first seat of King Arthur,

**Tristan:**
if you add in the seats of the advisor King Pellinore and the upcoming knight Bors, that brings it to 15 seats.

**Tristan:**
That was the Round Table as I knew it, during its heyday.

**Da Vinci:**
That's right. The golden age of the Knights of the Round Table, the most glamorous age of the Arthurian legend.

**Da Vinci:**
After this, despite the conclusion of the battles with the Picts and Saxons, as well as the quest for the Holy Grail,

**Da Vinci:**
the infidelity between Lancelot and Arthur's queen, Guinevere, was uncovered.

**Da Vinci:**
The Knights of the Round Table were greatly diminished by this incident,

**Da Vinci:**
and Mordred took advantage of King Arthur's expedition to the Roman Empire to stage a rebellion.

**Da Vinci:**
This culminated in the Battle of Camlann... or the last battle of King Arthur, as it would eventually be known.

**Da Vinci:**
It was in this battle that King Arthur drew one last breath.

**Da Vinci:**
The holy sword was returned to the fairies by the hand of Sir Bedivere,

**Da Vinci:**
and the curtain fell on the history of ancient Britain.

**Da Vinci:**
After that, King Arthur's remains were taken to a paradise at the ends of the world by the Lady of the Lake&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
The Once and Future King departed for Avalon.

**Da Vinci:**
And that's more or less the legend of King Arthur. Thank you for your kind attention~☆

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's...already dark...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Right, I get the gist of it.


---

**Da Vinci:**
Well then. With all that in mind, let's get back to the discussion of this Britain.

**Da Vinci:**
In our history, King Arthur was an unknown squire who managed to draw the Sword of Selection,

**Da Vinci:**
and amidst the admiration and jealousy, hope and prejudice of many knights, he ascended to the throne of king.

**Da Vinci:**
On the other hand, the Artoria of the Fairy Kingdom of Britain still remains unrecognized by anybody,

**Da Vinci:**
and seems to have been travelling alone through Britain as the Child of Prophecy, carrying the Staff of Selection.

**Da Vinci:**
The same name, the same face, the same fate. With this many parallels, there's no room for doubt.

**Da Vinci:**
The girl named Artoria Caster is this world's King Arthur.

**Da Vinci:**
The savior of Britain. Taking the role that the people wished for.

**Tristan:**
The savior of Britain, is she...? However, this time, the age is different.

**Tristan:**
King Arthur saved Britain in the fifth century, but it is now 2017.

**Tristan:**
If she was the savior of Britain, would she not have appeared further in the past?

**Da Vinci:**
That's the thing, isn't it? I'm not sure why she appeared now, of all times.

**Da Vinci:**
Nonetheless, I overheard something from the fairies.

**Da Vinci:**
“The Child of Prophecy is the reincarnation of the savior Tonelico. They've been sent to save Britain once again.”

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Like the world tree of Norse mythology?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. They share their name with the ash tree.

**Da Vinci:**
After Morgan conquered Britain, the years changed over to the Queen's Calendar.

**Da Vinci:**
This coincides with the switch to the Gregorian calendar in pan-human history.

**Da Vinci:**
In the outside world, pan-human history came to a halt in 2017. In this world, the Fairy Kingdom, it is the year 2017 of the Queen's Calendar.

**Da Vinci:**
So, the years before the Queen's Calendar... we would call it the BC era, right?

**Da Vinci:**
Here it's referred to as the Fairy Calendar,

**Da Vinci:**
and back then, there was a fairy who saved Britain from the Calamities many times.

**Da Vinci:**
That was the Savior, Tonelico.

**Da Vinci:**
Ector the Immortal, Archduke of Exhaust Heat Wryneck, Grimm the Wise, and the Knight of Beginnings, Totrot.

**Da Vinci:**
Their legends are still told, though it seems that most fairies don't remember them anymore.

**Da Vinci:**
If we assume these saviors have appeared in the past, then saviors that appear in the Fairy Kingdom are part of a system...

**Da Vinci:**
One that the island itself implements when Britain is in grave peril.

**Da Vinci:**
If you think about it that way, it would account for why Artoria was born into this age.

**Da Vinci:**
Besides, the enemy this time is Queen Morgan. Who else would it be but King Arthur?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The reincarnation...of the saviors...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Even in a Lostbelt, Morgan is her enemy...)


---

**Da Vinci:**
Well, that sure took a while, but based on all this information I have a couple of recommendations.

**Da Vinci:**
One is to continue cooperating with Artoria Caster.

**Da Vinci:**
We don't need to conquer this Lostbelt, but a confrontation with Queen Morgan seems unavoidable.

**Da Vinci:**
At that time, being allied with her, the Child of Prophecy, can only be a plus.

**Da Vinci:**
And the other thing is to keep our objective, and the true state of affairs within Chaldea, a secret.

**Da Vinci:**
Telling her about pan-human history is good. Otherwise we wouldn't be able to converse with her at all.

**Da Vinci:**
But don't disclose that Chaldea has pruned a number of Lostbelts already.

**Da Vinci:**
I'm aware we're being dishonest. But there are times when you just have to keep secrets from one another.

**Da Vinci:**
We talked about this before, but there's something fundamentally wrong with this Lostbelt. There are too many parts of it that just don't add up.

**Da Vinci:**
Until we can explain this, we should restrict our objective to “stop the annihilation of Britain.”

**Da Vinci:**
Even if the Britain we save ends up becoming our next opponent...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I understand...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You want me to keep Artoria in the dark?


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. I'm sorry, Fujimaru.

**Da Vinci:**
But my instincts are saying we must avoid telling her at all costs.

**Da Vinci:**
We'll save Britain, and prevent the Collapse from spreading across the bleached Earth.

**Da Vinci:**
When all is said and done, we'll say goodbye to her with a smiling face, never having needed to turn against this Britain.

**--ARROW--:**

**Artoria:**
Everyone, good morning~! Breakfast is ready!

**Artoria:**
The bread here is the best, it's so soft! This is... wheat, right?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ah, you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this morning, Artoria.|

**Artoria:**
Huh? But I'm always like this. Even when I'm feeling down, I get right back on my feet! That's my specialty!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wheat? Flour wheat?

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, that wheat.

**Da Vinci:**
Amazingly, the wheat here is of a far superior quality when compared to ours.


---

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Ah! Dabinchi taught me how to make bread!

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
I didn't know you could use flour in cooking! I always thought it was completely useless!

**Tristan:**
To have lived in buildings up until now, and not understood the value of flour...

**Tristan:**
It appears there are differences in the level of knowledge between individual fairies.

**Tristan:**
No, it is more like&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Seems like there are two kinds of fairies: those who mimic human culture in form only,

**Da Vinci:**
and those who have an interest in understanding the inner workings of their technology.

**Da Vinci:**
Most fairies are content to “imitate”...to just play along with it all.

**Da Vinci:**
They have no need to understand how it all works, since fairies can survive just fine without human technology.

**Da Vinci:**
You know how cars got more advanced, and required less maintenance from their drivers,

**Da Vinci:**
so inevitably, the number of drivers who knew how they actually work went down? Something like that.

**Da Vinci:**
Whenever they feel like eating something like bread, the fairies just use their magical energy to create it like ☆poof☆~

**Da Vinci:**
But that's nothing more than an imitation of “bread I tasted before.” Like 3D printing.

**Da Vinci:**
Fairies can only enjoy the intricacies of “human culture” when they have the original data.

**Da Vinci:**
Mike here, well, he's just a typical copycat.

**Da Vinci:**
Since I started working here, we've gotten into all kinds of stuff.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Th-that's right...

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
I was a simple, boring fairy until I met Dabinchi...

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
But now, every day is fun and delightful! My life is amazing!

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
In the past, I thought protecting humans was a selfish thing to do, but not any more.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Lady Aurora was right. We need humans to enjoy life.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Humans amass skills anyway. They make interesting, unnatural things.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Sometimes it's something that's not tasty or fun, like iron or gunpowder...

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
But, I recognize humans as my equals now. I respect them.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
It was a bother when this shop was handed down to me...or so I thought. But I was wrong.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
We need a reason to live. We need something to do other than “what we want.”

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
I can't stand the thought of just “being” any more!

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
Well, fundamentally, fairies are innocent. You could even say, “easily influenced”.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
That's not true! You're something special, Dabinchi! I've never had such inspiration, not even from Lady Aurora!

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, yeah. Then you'd better start learning to pronounce “da Vinci” correctly.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
I'll get it right, I swear! Oh yeah, you've got a message from Oberon.

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
“Come to the fields of Salisbury. Social studies are important, after all!”

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
That's what he said!

**Artoria:**
Huh? Social studies?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think we're in business!


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Field Fairy:**
I see, so that's how you get rid of vermin like that... that's good to know.

**Field Fairy:**
No matter how much I talked to them, they wouldn't leave, so I was at a loss as to what to do...

**Tristan:**
Fields are delicate things. At times like that, it is good to take a firm stance.

**Tristan:**
And taking your kind desire to not injure the bird into account...

**Tristan:**
From now on it would be good to place a statue in your likeness in the field to keep the birds in check...

**Tristan:**
The birds will assume you are watching them, and they will attack your statue first...

**Tristan:**
Such stalling for time may lead to something...

**Field Fairy:**
My...!

**Field Fairy:**
Are you a genius...?

**Tristan:**
Heh, I will not deny it...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(That's not how scarecrows work, you know...)


---

**Artoria:**
Umm...is Tristan always like this?

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. He's a knight with his head stuck in the clouds...

**Da Vinci:**
If he had a partner that kept him more down-to-earth, he'd be the perfect knight...

**Da Vinci:**
More importantly, what about the fields of Salisbury? They're nothing more than another imitation of human society, made by the fairies.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They're enormous.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
For what it's worth, they're real.


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, regardless of the method to get there, the finished product is the genuine article.

**Da Vinci:**
I'd heard that agriculture has thrived in the northern parts of Britain for a long time, but not so much in the south.

**Da Vinci:**
Under Aurora's direction, they finally started in earnest here in Salisbury.

**Artoria:**
There were small fields in my village too, but this is the first time I've seen one so large!

**Artoria:**
But why has it been so unpopular until now?

**Field Fairy:**
That's because when the Mors appeared, we had no choice but to abandon these fields.

**Field Fairy:**
It seems like there's not a lot of Mors up north, so you're free to tend your own fields as you please.

**Field Fairy:**
Down south, there are frequent outbreaks of Mors, so only the strongest fairies can leave the cities.

**Field Fairy:**
I've heard that the Fang Clan just say “death is a part of war!” and bear it up to a point, but...

**Field Fairy:**
A low-ranking fairy like me, with no Astrality—no Alien Common Sense—I can't even approach the Mors...

**Field Fairy:**
Besides, even if you cultivate a farm, you have to rebuild it every hundred years or so...

**Artoria:**
The Calamity that occurs once every hundred years. Even those of you without long lives fear it, huh?

**Field Fairy:**
Of course we do! When the disaster comes, only the fairies allowed inside Camelot will survive.

**Field Fairy:**
We'll all suffer and die. There isn't a single fairy in Britain who doesn't fear the Calamity!

**Field Fairy:**
Even Lady Aurora...how long can her radiance last? After what happened to Norwich...

**Field Fairy:**
If Norwich is swallowed by the Calamity, Salisbury is definitely next.

**Field Fairy:**
If that happens...this time, Lady Aurora will...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can't Lady Aurora escape to Camelot?|

**Field Fairy:**
Yes...Lady Aurora was granted permission to enter, but none of the other fairies were...

**Field Fairy:**
“If the people of Salisbury are not accepted, I shall not enter Camelot.”

**Field Fairy:**
When Lady Aurora responded that way, Her Majesty became extremely mad,

**Field Fairy:**
and forbade Lady Aurora from entering Camelot.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What exactly is a "Calamity?"

**Field Fairy:**
I don't know... The Calamities don't have a fixed form.

**Field Fairy:**
It's said that different forms of Calamity appear at different times.

**Field Fairy:**
If I recall...last time Darlington disappeared in the “Resurrection Calamity”, or something like that.

**Field Fairy:**
I wonder what terrible thing will arise this time...

**Field Fairy:**
Ah, why did I have to be born at this time? Why couldn't the previous generation endure another ten years...

**Field Fairy:**
No, why can't Her Majesty just open the gates of Camelot to everybody in the first place...

**Field Fairy:**
It would be great if they could shelter us in Camelot, even if it were just one year...


---

**Artoria:**
I see... You're dissatisfied with Her Majesty as well, aren't you?

**Artoria:**
There have been demonstrations against the Queen occurring all over lately. If you want to protest against her, why don't you join one?

**Field Fairy:**
Ah...

**Field Fairy:**
No, I'd rather not go that far...it's not like I'm disobeying the Queen in the first place...

**Field Fairy:**
The Calamities are terrible, but the Queen's army is even worse.

**Field Fairy:**
Her Majesty's magical energy extends beyond simply covering all of Britain.

**Field Fairy:**
She has trained Fairy Soldiers, and blessed Knights to command them&mdash;

**Field Fairy:**
Tristan of the Bewitched Strings, Gawain of the Sun, and Lancelot of the Shining Lake.

**Field Fairy:**
As long as those three Fairy Knights stand in the way, nobody can rebel against Her Majesty.

**Tristan:**
&mdash;Wha?

**Da Vinci:**
&mdash;Huh!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Say what?|


---

**Artoria:**
...? (Why is everyone so surprised?)

**--ARROW--:**

**Da Vinci:**
The emergency meeting is called to order!

**Da Vinci:**
The topic of discussion is the fairy knights! The three Fairy Knights in the service of Queen Morgan!

**Da Vinci:**
By the way, did you know about this, Artoria!?

**Artoria:**
Yes, it's common knowledge around here. Is this really such a big deal, though?

**Tristan:**
Yes, a great surprise for sure, akin to Sir Bedivere awakening from his sleep...

**Tristan:**
Artoria, could you please elaborate on this?

**Artoria:**
Huh...well, it's something everybody here simply knows.

**Artoria:**
The Fairy Knights are fairies gifted the names of knights from an alternate world by Queen Morgan.

**Artoria:**
Their magical energy is the greatest in the land, second only to the Queen herself.

**Artoria:**
Also, they can't be corrupted through contact with Mors. So when a swarm of them appears, they subjugate them.

**Artoria:**
Ah. Now that I mention it, they have another name.

**Artoria:**
Guardians of Britain who have all taken an oath under the Queen: the Knights of the Round Table.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Fairy Round Table...!|

**Da Vinci:**
Ah! You beat me to it! I was going to say that too!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Does Morgan actually like King Arthur, then?

**Tristan:**
No, 'tis nothing but mere mockery...the Witch Queen finds amusement in such harassment...

**Tristan:**
That is, if the Morgan of this Lostbelt possesses the same character as the Morgan I know.


---

**Artoria:**
Guys, do you all have some emotional attachment to the term? It's just a table, right? A round table?

**Da Vinci:**
There's no getting around it. I guess we have to tell you about your pan-human history self.

**Da Vinci:**
Artoria. In our world, Queen Morgan existed as well.

**Da Vinci:**
But she's from a tale from the fifth century, so she's about 1,600 years old.

**Da Vinci:**
At that time, there was a king who bested Morgan, united Britain, and led it into an age of peace.

**Da Vinci:**
That king's name was Arthur. Her hidden name was Artoria Pendragon.

**Artoria:**
Ooh, Artoria. The same name as me.

**Da Vinci:**
More than that, she was probably the same being.

**Da Vinci:**
Alright, listen. Don't be surprised by what I'm about to tell you.

**Da Vinci:**
In our world, you're the sovereign of Britain, a king commanding the respect of many knights.

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
Indeed. The ideal king, chosen by the “Sword of Selection” and trained by the magus Merlin.

**Da Vinci:**
She ruled by disguising herself as a boy, though.

**Da Vinci:**
King Arthur had many lords in her service. Think of them like the Fairy Kingdom's six clans.

**Da Vinci:**
And the most outstanding knights among these lords were the “Knights of the Round Table.” Knights unparalleled throughout history.

**Da Vinci:**
To tell you the truth, Sir Tristan here is one of them.

**Da Vinci:**
Meaning, from our point of view, the Knights of the Round Table under Morgan are:

**Da Vinci:**
“Heroes of justice, unknowingly following an evil dictator,”

**Da Vinci:**
more or less. It's a shock, don't you think?

**Da Vinci:**
Hello? Are you listening, Artoria?

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh shoot, she froze in astonishment!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know how you feel, but pull yourself together!


---

**Artoria:**
H-hah, haha...

**Artoria:**
I see...so I really was the Child of Prophecy after all...

**Artoria:**
I was thinking maybe, just maybe, everybody had the wrong idea...

**Artoria:**
Well, that's how it is!

**Artoria:**
After all, the old man said I was born together with the “Staff of Selection”!

**Artoria:**
All right, I feel a little more confident now!

**Artoria:**
Pendragon, was it? I'm going to follow their example and save Britain!

**Artoria:**
And there's a Knight of the Round Table here too!

**Artoria:**
Well, you had the same name as *that* Tristan, so I wondered if you were actually just really bloodthirsty,

**Artoria:**
but you really were a Knight of the Round Table! So cool!

**Tristan:**
As a knight, I am overjoyed to hear you say so, but...

**Tristan:**
What did you mean by “bloodthirsty”? You could not mean...the Tristan of the Fairy Kingdom...

**Artoria:**
They say she's the most brutal, ruthless, irritable, and indiscriminate fairy at the Round Table.

**Artoria:**
She's known as the “Fairy Slayer,” or “Tristan of the Bloody Heel.”

**Artoria:**
Since she became a fairy knight 100 years ago, she's killed roughly 400,000 fairies, or so they say.

**Artoria:**
But you're the complete opposite.

**Artoria:**
The way you fought together with Fujimaru was, how can I say it, like a flower amidst a tempest.

**Artoria:**
Keeping your poise and dignity, and doing your best no matter how rough it gets&mdash;

**Artoria:**
There aren't many people like that in this land.

**Artoria:**
It may have been a different world, but it's encouraging to think that someone like you placed your trust in me.

**Tristan:**
That is...

**Tristan:**
Yes...

**Tristan:**
Quite so. I shall remember to conduct myself accordingly.

**Artoria:**
Though, now I get it. I guess “Fairy Knight” is more than just a title, huh...

**Artoria:**
Hm...? Huh? But what you said about Fujimaru's world...

**Artoria:**
(Fairy Knight Tristan was appointed 100 years ago... after pan-human history's Tristan...)

**Artoria:**
(The original&ndash;the prototype Tristan is here, and the Fairy Knight is an imitation...)

**Artoria:**
(Has Her Majesty known about pan-human history for some time...?)

**Da Vinci:**
What an unexpected unfolding, to end up telling Artoria about King Arthur...

**Da Vinci:**
Well, that much is probably fine. And we now know more about the Fairy Knights.

**Da Vinci:**
Seriously, had we met one without any prior knowledge, I might have died of shock!

**Da Vinci:**
Well, they won't necessarily look like the Tristan and Gawain we're familiar with...

**Da Vinci:**
Either way, seeing as they have the same name, they probably share some characteristics.

**Da Vinci:**
Tristan would have Failnaught and Lancelot would have Arondight, I assume.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
By the way, where is Tristan?


---

**Da Vinci:**
Artoria's room. He wanted to talk to her privately.

**Artoria:**
The white dragon who called for the destruction of Britain when it was an “ancient island of Sacraments”...

**Artoria:**
The vile king, Vortigern.

**Artoria:**
The wrath of Britain...the incarnation of the will that tried to reject the age of man.

**Artoria:**
And created to oppose him, raised as the incarnation of the red dragon...

**Artoria:**
Artoria Pendragon.

**Artoria:**
The king who protected the people of Britain, preserved the country, and established the world of man.

**Artoria:**
Afterwards, fairies and Sacraments faded from the island,

**Artoria:**
but the result was the preservation of Britain's culture, passing it on to future generations.

**Artoria:**
...King Arthur didn't become King because she was strong,

**Artoria:**
but because she fought for the future of Britain.

**Artoria:**
That is why the Knights of the Round Table ceased fighting and sat at the same table.

**Tristan:**
Yes. Each and every one of us saw hope in the king.

**Tristan:**
Level-headed in war, yet just in rule.

**Tristan:**
In addition, she cherished all of Britain.

**Tristan:**
With her small body, she was willing to fight and be injured by enemies many times stronger than her.

**Artoria:**
That's...she must have been an amazing king...

**Tristan:**
Yes...

**Tristan:**
She was the bravest, most poignant, and...proudest person I ever knew.

**Tristan:**
However, the king was not flawless from the onset.

**Tristan:**
She spent the years after pulling the Sword of Selection training with Merlin and Sir Kay.

**Tristan:**
As such, there is no need to be in a rush now... or so I believe.

**Tristan:**
You do not just share her name, Artoria. You have her eyes.

**Tristan:**
Please believe in yourself. I believe you can do it.

**Artoria:**
King Arthur...a greater me from a different world...

**Artoria:**
Amazing. She must have worked so hard.

**--ARROW--:**

**Artoria:**
We're baaack! Tell us we did a good job, Mike!

**Artoria:**
We finished three tumultuous Oberon Quests in a row, or something!

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
O-oh. That means you're desperate or something, right? Is apple juice good? I'll get you some.

**Da Vinci:**
Thanks Mike, you're so thoughtful~☆ You're getting used to being a tavernkeep!

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Oh stop it~. You're an angel~. It's all thanks to Dabinchi~.

**Tristan:**
Arbitrating a sunshine rights dispute between the Wind and Earth Clans on Main Street...

**Tristan:**
Confirming the safety of a mysterious gift sent to the head of the Wind Clan (which turned out to be a massive bouquet)...

**Tristan:**
Suppressing a Wind Clan member who became desperate after falling in love with a human they met thirty years ago...

**Tristan:**
With that all finished, they were quite difficult, but I believe they were all worth doing.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I was nervous at first, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
In the end, everyone was smiling and happy!


---

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Oh yeah. You, the human. Fujimaru, right?

**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
You've got a guest in your room. She gets scary when she's kept waiting, so get going.

**Da Vinci:**
A visitor for Fujimaru?

**Coral:**
So...this is a room for humans...it's not too different from ours...

**Coral:**
No, we're the ones following their example, we really must thank them for that...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Coming in~|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Excuse me~


---

**Coral:**
It seems you've returned, human.

**Coral:**
Your work at the fields yesterday is appreciated. As a member of the Wind Clan, you have my thanks.

**Coral:**
......

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh, what is it...?|


---

**Coral:**
We've received some information...

**Coral:**
Every human captured in southern Britain is housed in a farm to the west...

**Coral:**
It seems that three days ago, a new human was interred there.

**Coral:**
It may be the person you have been searching for. If you are going to rescue them, I will prepare guides.

**Coral:**
Tonight, I will station a few soldiers outside of Salisbury.

**Coral:**
Meet with them, and finish your work for tonight.

**Coral:**
“I pray for your safety, and that you are reunited with your friend,” Lady Aurora wished me to say to you.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you, Coral!


---

**Coral:**
Thank Lady Aurora, not me. Now, I must return to my duties.

**Coral:**
I do not know what situation you are in, and I am in no position to offer my opinion, however...

**Coral:**
The farm is under Her Majesty's control. Security will be tight, so prepare accordingly.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;and that's what she said.|


---

**Da Vinci:**
They told us it would take two or three days, but it took them the shortest time, two days exactly. Not bad.

**Tristan:**
Interred three days ago...we have no time to lose.

**Tristan:**
We do not know what sort of facility this “farm” is, but we should not hesitate.

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Oberon hasn't come back, but I won't complain as long as we have some guides.

**Da Vinci:**
Now, as for Artoria?

**Da Vinci:**
This is our own problem, so you should stay here...

**Artoria:**
Of course I'll help you.

**Artoria:**
Our fates crossed when I ended up using her name, so I would like to meet her in person.

**Artoria:**
More importantly, I've gotten a lot more confident in the last few days! Breaking and entering, lockpicking, sleeping pills...

**Artoria:**
With Merlin's magecraft I can do a little bit of everything, so you can count on me!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Alright, let's go!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll ask about "Merlin's magic" later...


---

**Tristan:**
It seems those soldiers are our guides...

**Tristan:**
How surprising. They are human soldiers, and not fairies.

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, there are a lot of human soldiers in Salisbury. Their strength doesn't compare to the fairies,

**Da Vinci:**
but humans aren't opposed to carrying weapons, and more importantly, they can approach the Mors without fear.

**Da Vinci:**
“Human soldiers” are an anti-Mors measure. The clans probably feel that they're expendable.

**Da Vinci:**
Still, Aurora treasures human soldiers, and promotes the most able as her guards.

**Da Vinci:**
Remember the cathedral guards?

**Da Vinci:**
The fact that they were so strong is proof that Aurora bestows all sorts of privileges onto humans.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you not be feeling well?


---

**Artoria:**
Ah...no, I'm just a little anxious. It's my first time working with so many people, so...

**Artoria:**
Ahaha, Fujimaru is so calm, it's funny...

**Tristan:**
Please be quiet. It seems they've noticed us.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Hey, weird folks over there. Are you the ones Coral told us about?

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
So you came after all. Why go to all this trouble at this time of the year...

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Well, it can't be helped. This too is for Lady Aurora's sake. All right, follow me.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
I'll guide you to the farm. From here, it's two hours on foot. You all set?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please do.


---

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Sigh...what a bunch of weirdos...Lady Aurora sure is weak to the unusual...

**Da Vinci:**
Hm. Seems like we're not welcome somehow.

**Da Vinci:**
From their point of view, do we look like a bunch of creepy suitors trying to woo Lady Aurora?

**Artoria:**
Still, they're helping us out of good faith, so we should be thankful.

**Artoria:**
Let's go, Fujimaru. Looks like there won't be any small talk from hereon out. Too bad.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
We're here. This is the western human farm.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Human...farm...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is this the right place...?


---

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Yeah. We once lived here too.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
I was assigned to an awful fairy. They broke me in just about every way, then tossed me aside like garbage.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Lady Aurora gave lost humans like me a place to belong.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
We became soldiers in order to win the freedom that Lady Aurora showed us.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
We have the will to oppose the Queen.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Rebels these days don't need to rely on something like the Child of Prophecy.

**Tristan:**
A rebel army...we heard mention of them before, but are there other movements opposing the Queen, aside from Salisbury?

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Yeah. A bunch of them have taken over a ruined castle out east. They're campaigning for the liberation of Britain.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
But they named themselves the “Round Table” of all things...still, they're no joke in terms of warpower.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
The one in charge managed to survive against Lancelot in the games at Camelot.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Morgan was so impressed that a human was able to stand up to a Fairy Knight, she awarded him a position as one of her soldiers.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
I think his name was&mdash;yeah, Percival. Percival of the White Light, the pinnacle of human ability.

**Tristan:**
&mdash;!

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Because of his ability, Morgan ordered him to enter Camelot, despite being a human.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
But the weirdo defied her, and founded the rebel army instead.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, B:**
Hey, that's far enough. Going any farther is dangerous.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, B:**
If we're seen here, it'll make trouble for Lady Aurora.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, B:**
This is as far as we stick with you shabby country fairies. We're heading back to Salisbury.

**Da Vinci:**
So you just came along to show us the way...

**Da Vinci:**
You're saying that sneaking into the ranch and looking for someone is our own job?

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Less your job and more your own problem now. You should be grateful we led you this far.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
The Wind Clan may be versatile, but we're not suited for combat.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
If Morgan sees us as hostile, she'll destroy both Salisbury and Lady Aurora.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
And Lady Aurora asked us to help you lot out, despite the danger.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
So listen...if you manage to get yourselves caught, don't mention Salisbury.

**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
There will be no need to return the favor. Provided you have even a shred of dignity towards humans.

**Artoria:**
Let's hash out our plan here. I've just finished the structural analysis.

**Artoria:**
The sense I got from it is that there are six large factories inside, and about thirty smaller workshops.

**Artoria:**
There are no sources of heat inside the larger ones, so they seem to be shut down at the moment.

**Artoria:**
The smaller ones have a much larger heat signature, and probably accommodate about 60 humans.

**Artoria:**
What should we do, Fujimaru?

**Artoria:**
We could climb the walls and get in without being seen by the guards.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're really good with your hands, Artoria.|

**Artoria:**
I-it's not like I like doing this...

**Artoria:**
It's a skill that lets me grasp the inner workings of a structure by sending a wave of magical energy out in a cone, then reading the response through the wall.

**Artoria:**
Basic burglary magecraft taught to me by Merlin, since he thought I'd need it!

**Tristan:**
Heh, how nostalgic...Merlin is the same in any world...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Has something upset you...?

**Artoria:**
No, not at all. I was just focused on figuring out the situation inside.

**Artoria:**
Forget about those people who just said whatever they wanted and ran off, and go look for Mash!


---

**Da Vinci:**
Hrm. Do you feel a connection through your contract with Mash, Fujimaru?

**Da Vinci:**
It's the quickest way to be sure.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe yes, maybe no...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's close, yet far...


---

**Da Vinci:**
I wonder if you're confused or unsure. To tell the truth, I'm getting the same feeling.

**Da Vinci:**
The Fairy Kingdom has far too many “contracts” formed in it.

**Da Vinci:**
Maybe when fairies come to own humans, they forge a bond similar to a Servant's contract.

**Da Vinci:**
Looks like the only way to find out if Mash is captured or not is to check directly.

**Da Vinci:**
Tristan, can you carry Fujimaru and Artoria over the wall?

**Da Vinci:**
Ah, I'm alright, I'll skate up.

**Tristan:**
Of course. Silent, magnificent wire action...

**Tristan:**
No, I shall display my lyre action. This way, you two.

**Artoria:**
I'll lead the way. The western wall is undermanned, so let's go up that one!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's a city inside too...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(There's nobody around, but...)


---

**Tristan:**
Artoria. By large factories did you mean building complexes, and by smaller ones did you mean residences?

**Artoria:**
Yes. Humans kept on a farm are shipped with their creativity preserved.

**Artoria:**
Therefore, their imprisonment takes the form of a residential dwelling.

**Artoria:**
You can disregard the big factory. Mash won't be there.

**Artoria:**
It's not the birthing period now, so there shouldn't be anything inside there.

**Da Vinci:**
&mdash;

**???:**
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/NkGVSh6.png#gh-light-mode-only)&ndash;？

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria, behind you!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's something there!


---

**Artoria:**
A surveillance familiar...! I see, it was disguised as the light of a lamp...!

**Artoria:**
I screwed up again...sorry everyone! If we don't beat that thing, a lot more will show up!

**???:**
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/NkGVSh6.png#gh-light-mode-only)&ndash;!!!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Da Vinci:**
We've defeated so many, but there's no end to them! There's got to be a fairy somewhere controlling them!

**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, can you look for them!? Our hands are full with the familiars!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Leave it to me&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Stay calm, and keep your eyes open...!)


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There! There's something in the shadow of that building!|


---

**Tristan:**
Certainly, that is the only place with no sound. They seem to be able to hide in the shadows&mdash;

**Tristan:**
No shield can protect from my Fantasia...shall I divide your torso into four?

**Fairy in Armor:**
D-damn&mdash;what the hell are you? That weird trick you just pulled...you're neither human nor fairy.

**Fairy in Armor:**
And you're not Mors or part of the Round Table... could you be the Child of Prophecy?

**Fairy in Armor:**
Hah. Hahahah! This is great, it's my lucky day!

**Fairy in Armor:**
My name is Grant, Grant the Knight! The Child of Prophecy's magecraft is no match for the Queen's power!

**E：Knight Grant:**
Don't assume this armor will break from one or two hits! It was granted to me by Queen Morgan herself...!

**Artoria:**
Wha! What's in that thing? Not only a fairy, but...!?

**Artoria:**
Be careful everyone! That's probably one of the Fairy Knights we've heard about...!

**--BATTLE--:**

**D：Knight Grant:**
Gah&mdash;

**D：Knight Grant:**
How shameful...for a knight of Camelot...to lose to one so small&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's down and not moving...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did we beat him...?


---

**Artoria:**
...

**Artoria:**
We did it, we won! He was super strong, but we defeated a Fairy Knight!

**Artoria:**
Well, it was thanks to you all!

**Tristan:**
No...he was probably just a regular knight.

**Tristan:**
There is no Knight of the Round Table by the name of Grant. Moreover, over there.

**Da Vinci:**
Aah, there's still three of them left, and they have as much magical energy as the one from before~!

**Da Vinci:**
Just one was a handful. This is too much for us!

**Da Vinci:**
Let's fall back for now, Fujimaru!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We still don't know about Mash!


---

**Armed Soldier:**
All right, we're through the gate&ndash;! Squads 1 and 3, you're with me! Let's hit Morgan's troops from the front!

**Armed Soldier:**
Squad 2, take control of the factory! Release our comrades inside before they can be processed!

**Morgan's Soldier:**
Reinforcements from the gate!? The Child of Prophecy was a diversion...!

**Morgan's Soldier:**
Never mind that, first we have to retake the gate! That's Londinium's rebel army!

**Morgan's Soldier:**
Some of them are armed with Mors-poisoned iron! Don't underestimate them, they're tough!

**Tristan:**
This...it seems we have some unexpected reinforcements. Are they the rebel army we heard about...?

**Tristan:**
They may be weaker in individual abilities, but their numbers are vastly overwhelming.

**Tristan:**
It is only a matter of time. The three Fairy Knights are sure to be killed.

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, sure looks that way. They saved us in the nick of time, but...

**Da Vinci:**
After they defeat the fairies, they might not be so friendly to us.

**Da Vinci:**
Let's look for Mash while we can, Fujimaru.

**Da Vinci:**
We should contact the rebels after that. Artoria, can I ask you to lead the way?

**Artoria:**
T-that's right! Leave it to me, lockpicking is my specialty!

**Artoria:**
It's as da Vinci says, they may be rebels, but they're not necessarily on our side.

**Artoria:**
Let's find Mash before anything else happens, and escape before we're discovered!

**--ARROW--:**

**Artoria:**
Aw shucks...

**Artoria:**
As expected of a facility under the Queen's direct control...this magic lock is top-of-the-line...dang it...

**Tristan:**
While we worked on just one, the Round Table forces opened all 29 others...

**Artoria:**
They even opened that last one for us...hahaha...

**Da Vinci:**
Don't be so down, Artoria. Well, as an engineer, I can understand how you feel.

**Da Vinci:**
But thanks to these efforts, all the people imprisoned in the residences were able to be freed.

**Da Vinci:**
It's too bad Mash wasn't among them...but that doesn't mean this was all a big waste of time.

**Da Vinci:**
At least Mash hasn't been caught. Depending on how you look at it, this is actually the better outcome.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Yeah. I'm sure Mash is alright.|

---

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Everyone, this way please. We've got more than enough food and coats to go around.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
After we've checked everyone's names and conditions, we'll move out.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Are there any humans left inside? If you have any information, please let us know.

**Incarcerated Man:**
Impossible...an army of humans. An army of humans defeated the Queen's soldiers!

**Incarcerated Man:**
So the rumors of the Round Table Army are true! We won't have to live at their mercy anymore!

**Incarcerated Child:**
I can go outside...?

**Incarcerated Child:**
But the knights told me to study until I grew up, since the outside is dangerous and humans would die right away.

**Incarcerated Woman:**
Two years...I haven't been outside in two years... I need to get back to Gloucester soon...

**Incarcerated Woman:**
I left behind someone important. We were separated.

**Incarcerated Woman:**
My child...how have they fared without me?

**Bound Soldiers of Morgan:**
...

**Tristan:**
Nevertheless, these Round Table soldiers are splendidly managed.

**Tristan:**
The defeated and surviving knights were restrained, rather than killed.

**Tristan:**
They are a well-organized army, not a mere murderous horde.

**Tristan:**
The greatest of the human knights who founded the Round Table Army, Percival...

**Tristan:**
I am overjoyed...

**Tristan:**
It may not be the same Sir Percival that I know, but he has earned the name he shares with him...

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Ah, you guys. Thanks for earlier, you were a big help.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
We've been watching this place closely for the last few months, so we knew they were short handed today.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
But I never thought anyone would break in ahead of us. And it only took four people to take down one of Morgan's knights.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
We were prepared to take casualties of up to 20%, but thanks to you, we've only sustained a few injuries.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
So which city's rebel group are you from? I've never seen you guys in the south...are you from up north?

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
That's right...I heard there was an uprising in Sheffield...

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria...?|


---

**Artoria:**
&mdash;Um, are all of you really...?

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Huh? Oh, right. We're the only ones who call fairies “people” nowadays.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
It doesn't matter if you're a fairy or a human, everyone in the Round Table Army is a “person.”

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
That's why I called you four people...was that rude?

**Artoria:**
N-no, that's not it...

**Artoria:**
&mdash;Um...in the Round Table Army, is everyone like you?

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Hahaha. Well, I don't know about that. Everyone has different motives and ways of thinking.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
But we all believe in the boss. The ideals Percival set forth are enough reason to fight.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
“The Child of Prophecy will definitely come forth. Gather comrades for that moment.”

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
“To support the Child of Prophecy who bears so heavy a responsibility, lay the groundwork to oppose the Queen.”

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
The boss always says that...oh, it's getting too noisy.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Seems like the muster's over. We'll escort the people to Londinium.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
What about you guys? Good fighters are always welcome there.

**Artoria:**
That's...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sorry. We have to decline.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We've got something else to take care of right now.


---

**Artoria:**
Yes. We're honored by your invitation, but we're in the middle of looking for someone right now.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
I see...that's a shame. But if you've decided, there's no helping it.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Take care, everyone. I hope you find who you're looking for safe and sound.

**Da Vinci:**
And there he goes...I gotta say, that seemed like a good offer. Why'd you turn it down, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, Artoria didn't seem to like the idea...|

---

**Tristan:**
If I said I was not interested in the Round Table Army, that would be a lie. However...

**Tristan:**
Our highest priority is to reunite with Mash. We have not yet had that chance, I think is what they want to say.

**Da Vinci:**
Of course! As expected of one of the original Round Table's gentlemen!

**Tristan:**
Heh...I am Tristan the Lamenting, a knight who lives not only for the greater good...

**Tristan:**
However, if it were Sir Bedivere here in my place, the choice before him would be quite grave&mdash;

**Tristan:**
&mdash;! Fujimaru! On the ground!

**???:**
I didn't think the gap in our security would be exploited. Only the most clever could have gotten this far.

**???:**
But it's not enough. Such poor, weak conviction. How very human.

**???:**
If you're going to hide in the shadows and steal all our work, then you'll have no objections to being trampled, will you?

**Da Vinci:**
What a bizarre magical energy reaction...! I can't measure it, what the&mdash;!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Living things, bound with chains...!)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Those flames just now...the Round Table Army)


---

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Squad 2, Squad 3, are you all right...!? Crap, how many of them got swallowed up!?

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Are we the only ones left!? It can't be, this wall of fire&mdash;

**???:**
Hm. A few left over. If we were in the plains, I would have swallowed you all...

**???:**
This farm is the property of Her Majesty Morgan. Such destruction is unacceptable.

**???:**
My horn will butcher the rest of you. Resist if you dare, humans.

**???:**
I have no time for cowards. If you are brave, I will show mercy.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
That's impossible...why is SHE here...?

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
That greatsword of black flames and silver armor... the fairy-devouring Black Dog...

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Fairy Knight Gawain! Why is the Queen's right hand here!?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;You.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
If all you're going to do is butter me up and not draw your sword, my horn has no need to cross with you.

**O：Gawain's Soldier, A:**
Lord Gawain. We've captured all the escaped humans.

**P：Gawain's Soldier, B:**
We'll round up these thieves. One human and three fairies will pose no problem.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
No...they are my prey. Stand down.

**Fujimaru 1:**
(This intimidating air, it's just like Gawain in the Holy City...!)|

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You as well...? I had expected a bit more from you than the other humans.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
They've become nothing more than this land's livestock. Such frail meat barely sates the appetite.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I can't get swallowed up...talk first...!)

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;Got a bit of a backbone, do you? Good, my appetite's riled up and my tongue is itching for a taste.


---

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
There is no need to give me your name. I have no interest in such things.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Her Majesty already told me. {(M) Boy /(F) Girl}, you're the Master from pan-human history, aren't you?

**Da Vinci:**
!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Do not be so surprised. The outside world... pan-human history,

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Her Majesty gifted all of us Fairy Knights with that information. &mdash;She said to capture you, given the chance.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Hm...a capture order...it is unusual for Her Majesty.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Shameless intruders.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
How dare such arrogant garbage set foot in the Fairy Kingdom of Britain.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Isn't it proper decorum in your world to extend a reception to guests?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Very well, draw your swords! As you wish, I'll welcome you with open arms!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
My name is Gawain! One of Britain's protectors, a Knight of the Fairy Round Table!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
By this name bestowed upon me by the Queen, I shall annihilate you!

**--BATTLE--:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Consciousness...fading...!)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(No...I have to push on)


---

**Da Vinci:**
Hang on, Fujimaru...! No good, you're way too weak...!

**Da Vinci:**
That Fairy Knight, the Command Spells, she... she ATE the magical energy!? What kind of sense does that make...!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I've never tasted resistance like this before...

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Weak yet not, powerless yet not...hm?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
What's that face for, you wretch? It's not fear or despair. Is that...hate?

**Artoria:**
Good, you've learned to understand that much.

**Artoria:**
It's been a while. I can't believe we've met again, though I had hoped we wouldn't.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You know her, Artoria...!?|


---

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;I don't know you.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I wouldn't remember inconsequential small fry like you. Are you a weed I stepped on somewhere?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
In any case, try and grow up a little more before speaking to me. You make my neck ache. With a body like yours, you'll likely never deal with such issues.

**Artoria:**
Y-you...!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Enough joking around. I have no compassion to extend to aggressors.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You'll die here with the human, Servants. I won't waste my time on you all.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Hm? Is that...a string?

**Tristan:**
It is...

**Tristan:**
That is my unrestricted, inexhaustible, and indestructible magical bowstring.

**Tristan:**
No matter your persistence, you will never be able to get past it.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
So it would seem...is this the Wing Clan's magic thread? I'm surprised it's still around.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
To what end? You're not saying you'll beat me with this, are you?

**Tristan:**
No...but it should suffice to restrain you.

**Tristan:**
Da Vinci. Artoria. I shall hold her off here.

**Tristan:**
Use this opportunity to get Fujimaru out of the town.

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, no problem. Honestly, it'll be tough, but getting away is our responsibility.

**Da Vinci:**
I'll take Fujimaru on my arm.

**Da Vinci:**
Get up, Artoria. Sorry, but I can't carry you.

**Artoria:**
Yeah, but&mdash;just us?

**Tristan:**
Yes. Do not worry about me. It appears that this place is where I must meet my death.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;

**Artoria:**
Why...are you seriously saying that...?

**Artoria:**
Talking about getting killed so casually... First of all, what do you think you're doing in a condition like that...!

**Tristan:**
Oh? When your opponent is Sir Gawain, you get accustomed to this.

**Tristan:**
I have already devised a trump card against him. If all goes well, we shall meet up with each other soon.

**Tristan:**
However, I cannot use it while you are all here.

**Tristan:**
Hurry now, my King...your journey is yet to begin.

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
I'm all set, let's go!

**Da Vinci:**
If you're not up for it, I'm leaving you behind! You understand!?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;Let me guess. You are going to sacrifice yourself, aren't you?

**Tristan:**
Oh. You think to mention something so obvious?

**Tristan:**
I see, you truly are Sir Gawain. Both your body and mind are as dense as rock.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Tell me one thing. Is this what a Servant is?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
A mere puppet that will throw away its own life for the sake of its Master? Not fearing death, nor ever really knowing life?

**Tristan:**
Well, I don't know about that. I think we all want to avoid death, Servant or not.

**Tristan:**
No, if anything, my fear of death is even greater now than when I was alive.

**Tristan:**
Heroic Spirits know what a miracle each summoning is.

**Tristan:**
A one-time opportunity. A posthumous dream that is inherently unattainable.

**Tristan:**
We are all familiar with the sensation of death. Dark, painful, cruel&mdash;sorrowful to the bitter end.

**Tristan:**
It is not something that is so easily endured from having tasted it once already.

**Tristan:**
As far as life is concerned, death can only be handled once.

**Tristan:**
Experiencing the pain of your own death over and over&mdash;Forcing the grief of your death onto others again and again&mdash;

**Tristan:**
I cannot bear it. So, to be honest, I am hoping you will have failed to notice.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
That is your choice. I will only kill your Master.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
If you retreat here, I'll turn a blind eye to it. Your skill is impressive.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Even if your Master dies, there are other ways to sustain yourself in the Land of the Fae.

**Tristan:**
No. Above all, I shall stop you here, Fairy Knight Gawain.

**Tristan:**
For the sake of those who fought beside me in my weakness, and placed their trust in me as a “knight.”

**Tristan:**
I have no knowledge of your circumstances, nor any interest in your justice.

**Tristan:**
I will lay down my life for those I love, and in a manner more ruthless than anyone else.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Strings all over my body...!? When did you do this!?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
No, what of it? If you think you can restrain me with human strength&mdash;

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Ggh, nnrgh...! This...how is this even possible!?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You've strung up the whole city without moving or using magic...!

**Tristan:**
You're right. What binds you is not sheer force, but restraint through weight.

**Tristan:**
What seals you is the very mass of this city itself... that is to say, the accumulation of human technology.

**Tristan:**
I grasped your power during the previous battle. Your body will not be able to simply shrug this off.

**Tristan:**
&mdash;The fingers on my right hand may be shredded....but I still have my mouth.

**Tristan:**
Prepare yourself, foreign knight, to receive the full force of my aerial attack!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Ah! The weight...of human technology...!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I see, you'll die foolishly after all, Servant!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Along with your hubris, having faith in such petty tricks&mdash;!

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
L-Lord Gawain, are you injured!? The farm is...!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It doesn't matter. I'll bear the repercussions from Her Majesty. Now, as for the human and Servants that escaped.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I'm a bit slow on my feet. Assemble the fast ones and give chase.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You will be able to catch up quickly...they're not like the man who just fell.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Surround them and keep them from moving. Don't kill them until I get there.

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
Yes! Leave it to us, Lord Gawain!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
That affected me a little... My body is slightly numb all over.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I should have asked his name. He was too good a human to simply...defeat.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Wait...what was that sound?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh...what was...that noise?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Sorry, I'll explain later! We're being chased by fairies right now!

**Da Vinci:**
Can you stand? Or run? Then I'll let you down. Run as hard as you can!

**Artoria:**
You're fast for someone from the Earth Clan! Ah, da Vinci! They've caught up!

**Da Vinci:**
Aaah~ ~! And despite the opportunity Tristan gave us!

**Da Vinci:**
But we're out of options. There's nowhere to hide on these plains.

**Da Vinci:**
Eh? What's that noise?

**Oberon:**
Alright, made it just in time! Fairy King Oberon, making his appearance to save you all!

**Oberon:**
You know about carriages? Okay, that's great! Get on, get on! We'll talk about this later!

**Artoria:**
Eh...a carriage? That carriage!? The thing only clan heads are allowed to ride in!?

**Horse:**
Yes. Tools that exploit animals are forbidden in Britain.

**Horse:**
However, there are also fairies that voluntarily enter the working world.

**Horse:**
I am the Fairy Horse Red Rab-bit of the Fang Clan, enthralled by the culture known as the “horse-drawn carriages.”

**G：Red Rabbit:**
I serve Lady Aurora, but have neigh'd a special exception for Lord Oberon this time.

**G：Red Rabbit:**
I hoof a feeling this is a most fateful encounter, so please enjoy the splendor of my carriage.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The carriage is a carriage, but the engine is a fairy...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Red...Rabbit...?


---

**Da Vinci:**
There's a lot to say here, but nice timing, Oberon!

**Da Vinci:**
Everyone, get on! We can shake off the soldiers with this!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Nicely prepared. Do we know who owns that carriage?

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
We do not. There's a fairy among us who used to build them, but he said:

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
“It's a design I've never seen before. It was probably built by a clan without Her Majesty's permission.”

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
...and that's all he had to say. I apologize for the lack of usefulness...

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Fine. Recall the men. We're returning to Camelot.

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
Is this outcome all right?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I don't have the time to spare chasing rats. No, I take that back. They're not even rats.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Britain is the Queen's garden. It's not unusual to find a few insects crawling around.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
They just caught my ire this time. The next time we face one another, I'll crush them for sure.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Although&mdash;I doubt that will be my job.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
There are others more qualified to crush scampering insects.

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
Ooh, fair Lancelot! Britain's strongest Fairy Knight!

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
If she is set on them, she'll bring them down in the blink of an eye, no matter where in Britain they run!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;

**Gawain's Soldier, B:**
(What the hell are you saying, do you have a death wish!? Talking about Lord Lancelot in front of Lord Gawain is...)

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
Ah! O-Oh, I pray your forgiveness, Lord Gawain! It goes without saying that the strongest of the fairy knights is of course Ga&mdash;

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
True, your appraisal of the strongest was correct. Don't make that mistake again.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
And, not just among the fairy knights. The strongest being in the fairy kingdom.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
We are not even in the same class as her. Keep that in mind.

**Gawain's Soldier, A:**
Y-yes&mdash;! I understand!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Bring along the confined humans. We'll process them before we return.

**I：Prisoner:**
A-ahh...! Wait, no! It's not our fault!

**I：Prisoner:**
They're the ones who opened the doors...! I told them I didn't want to!

**I：Prisoner:**
Don't kill me, don't kill me...! I'll never wish for my freedom ever again!

**I：Prisoner:**
I still have ten years left in me! Don't I still have worth as a slave!?

**I：Prisoner:**
So please help&mdash;Aaaaah!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;Don't be so conceited.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
A human who thought even once of running away has no worth, even as a slave.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
That is the appearance you all deserve. Until you become like slaves once again, I will break you.

## Fragment / 2 

**Rob (Older Brother):**
The cart's heavier than usual...

**Rob (Older Brother):**
Let's dump that weapon! There aren't any buyers for stuff like that, it's too dangerous!

**Wag (Younger Brother):**
What are you on about, brother? Annis is gonna cry again!

**Wag (Younger Brother):**
She was so thankful that we agreed to take the weapon along!

**Winky (Rob and Wag's Evil Friend):**
If you say so. It was Wag who was flying high when Annis grabbed his hand, wasn't it?

**Winky (Rob and Wag's Evil Friend):**
In the city where Annis is from, they call it a handshake, I hear.

**Winky (Rob and Wag's Evil Friend):**
It's a custom I've never heard of, even in a diverse place like Norwich or a trendsetting city like Gloucester.

**Annis:**
Um, Rob, if you're tired I can take your place...

**Annis:**
Even if I don't have any memory, I can still pull a cart...

**Rob:**
It's fine! I can do it by myself just fine!

**Rob:**
Get some rest, Annis! We're almost at Gloucester, and we need to get you properly cleaned up!

**Narration:**
The girl who had lost her memory, and the mangy fairy peddlers, Rob, Wag, and Winky.

**Narration:**
The odd group headed northward, away from the Nameless Forest.

**Narration:**
There had been a suggestion to sell the girl to a ranch along the way, but Rob hated Woodwose, head of the Fang Clan.

**Narration:**
His stubbornness not to sell such a beauty to such a violent person had landed them in this situation. Way to go, big bro!

**Annis:**
Whoa...I can see a city in the distance! What kind of city is that, Winky?

**Winky:**
That's Gloucester, Annis. Isn't it amazing? It's a very special city in Britain.

**Winky:**
A city of fashion and pleasure. A high-class city run by the Wing Clan head, the beloved Muryan.

**Winky:**
As long as you have money, you can get anything you want. Lovers, slaves, fairies, humans, aaaanything.

**Winky:**
I don't like it, though. The only thing that attracts people to that city is whatever forms the latest trend.

**Winky:**
Most stuff is gold-plated, but as soon as you bite into it, you'll know it's really dirt on the inside.

**Annis:**
Is that so?

**Annis:**
But that knife of yours, Winky, you bragged about it being made in Gloucester, didn't you?

**Winky:**
If it were real, it'd be too valuable to use, wouldn't it? It's a fake, so I don't care if it breaks.

**Annis:**
I see. That is very like you, Winky.

**Wag:**
You hate Gloucester, Winky? Then why'd you choose this route?

**Wag:**
We could've gone to Norwich, you know. I mean, the “Calamity” is a scary thought, but still...

**Rob:**
You can't use the eastern route this time of year, you idiot. It's after the rainy season, so Dracae's territory is larger than usual.

**Rob:**
Plus, apparently they haven't even fixed the bridge over Norwich yet. That's why Gloucester is the only way.

**Rob:**
Oh, no, no, no! I'm going to have to bow my head to that vain Muryan!

**Annis:**
Fufu, you two like Muryan, don't you?

**Rob:**
No, what!? I just told you, I hate her!

**Annis:**
I can tell, since you have such a kind face. You've even gone a little red.

**Winky:**
Huh, goho, goh...?!

**Wag:**
Whoa, look, bro! Winky's so startled, he's coughing his face off!

**Wag:**
What are you so embarrassed about? Is it 'cause what she said is true?

**Winky:**
Loudmouth. It's not like that, just shut up.

**Winky:**
Ahem. More importantly, did you hear about that fiasco in Camelot?

**Winky:**
About 10 days ago, some thug made an attempt on Lady Morgan's head.

**Rob:**
Yeah. I heard he made it all the way to the throne, beating up the soldiers all by himself.

**Rob:**
Apparently, neither Lord Gawain nor Lord Tristan could stop him.

**Rob:**
But didn't Lord Lancelot fly in and stop him?

**Rob:**
They say the thug was dropped in the Great Pit after a chaotic air battle.

**Wag:**
Wow...well, it is Lord Lancelot, after all.

**Annis:**
Gawain...Tristan...Lancelot...

**Winky:**
Hmm? What's the matter, Annis, are you sick? Rob, you're pulling too hard. Go a little slower.

**Annis:**
Huh...? No, it's not that...it's just...my head hurts.

**Annis:**
When I heard the names of those people just now, I felt so excited...

**Annis:**
Um, what kind of people are they?

**Rob:**
(Ah...right, she might not remember what a Fairy Knight is...)

**Rob:**
(Best keep my mouth shut about it...)

**Wag:**
Don't you know, Annis? They are the Fairy Knights of the Round Table!

**Wag:**
Gawain, the most feared Fairy Knight in Britain.

**Wag:**
Tristan, the most hated Fairy Knight in Britain.

**Wag:**
Lancelot, the most beautiful Fairy Knight in Britain.

**Wag:**
With these three fighting off the Mors, we can keep peddling at our leisure.

**Wag:**
Well, Lord Tristan wouldn't bother to protect us.

**Wag:**
I'd rather be on edge than a Mors, though! Plus, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near New Darlington!

**Narration:**
The younger brother, Wag, laughed innocently.

**Narration:**
Meanwhile, Rob and Winky were nervous that Annis may have remembered something.

**Narration:**
&mdash;Then...

**???:**
GuRuuuuuuuuu...!

**Rob:**
Aah, it's a Black Dog!

**Rob:**
Wag, you idiot! All that talk about Tristan has attracted trouble!

**Rob:**
Everybody, abandon the wagon and run! It's a fairy eater! It'll eat us!

**Rob:**
Annis, quick, get away! I'll stop this thing&mdash;

**Rob:**
Huh&mdash;!?

**Annis:**
I don't know why it's attacking us, but I won't allow you all to get hurt!

**Annis:**
I'm your opponent. Come at me!

**Annis:**
Hah. Haah.

**Annis:**
Thank God. My body moved instantaneously, but I managed.

**Annis:**
Is everyone okay...?

**Narration:**
With a thud, she bravely stood her shield on the ground, and looked back at the fairies.

**Narration:**
All three of their faces were shocked. Naturally, they had never seen such a dainty knight before!

**Wag:**
That&mdash;that was amazing! You got rid of the Black Dogs all by yourself, Annis!

**Narration:**
Black Dogs are feared in the Fairy Kingdom. They follow the rotten smell of mortal life.

**Narration:**
They're evil fairies, from the Unseelie Court, unrelated to the six clans, and they appear out of nowhere.

**Narration:**
The only kind of villain in Britain to eat fairies!

**Rob:**
Hold on, isn't it weird, that strength? Could she be the one&mdash;

**Rob:**
Are you the Child of Prophecy!?

**Winky:**
Huh? Rob, no matter what, that is simply...

**Rob:**
It's true, isn't it? Iron armor, iron shield, and now we've seen her power!

**Rob:**
As good as a Fairy Knight! If that isn't special, I don't know what is!

**Wag:**
Yes, yes, yes! Annis is the Child of Prophecy! Because she saved us!

**Annis:**
...? The Child of Prophecy...? Me...?

**Wag:**
Yes, I'll start from the beginning!

**Wag:**
The Child of Prophecy, who will save Britain! The Child of Prophecy, who will defeat the queen!

**Wag:**
The Child of Prophecy, who we've been waiting for a long, loooong time, destined to save all the fairies!

**Narration:**
Rob, the greedy older brother, and Wag, the obedient younger brother.

**Narration:**
One spoke from self-interest, the other from his heart, eagerly telling the story of the Mirror Clan's prophecy.

**Narration:**
But, for the girl with no memories, seeing the two of them so very happy,

**Narration:**
seemed like truly a good thing, and so she believed it without question.

**Winky:**
Idiots...they don't get it. If you tell a lie, it'll become the truth.

**Winky:**
If the world believes Annis is the Child of Prophecy, it's over.

**Winky:**
She'll be snatched up in a heartbeat, by someone much greedier than us.

## Section 4: Gluocester (I) 

**Oberon:**
I see...so Tristan stayed behind at the farm.

**Oberon:**
He was an outstanding knight. Even someone as averse to combat as me can see that.

**Oberon:**
That was his decision. It was probably the best course of action, but...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(If only I'd held on a bit longer...)


---

**Oberon:**
...

**Oberon:**
What's the matter, Fujimaru? You want to go back to the farm?

**Oberon:**
There's nothing left there, but you could go to pay your respects.

**Oberon:**
The farm is in ruins. The fairy knights have already left. There's no danger in going back.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No...we have to do what we can now.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We can grieve after we find Mash.


---

**Da Vinci:**
I agree. Tristan did everything in his power to ensure we could escape.

**Da Vinci:**
He fought to keep us moving forward. Tell him that when we find Mash.

**Artoria:**
...

**Oberon:**
I see. If that's how you feel, then forget I even mentioned it.

**Oberon:**
By the way! Wasn't my timing awesome, all things considered?

**Oberon:**
It's the prince's prerogative to rush in on a white steed. I begged Aurora to let me borrow her carriage.

**Oberon:**
The problem is...

**Red Rabbit:**
(Whinny) Do you have a problem with my fur coat?

**Oberon:**
Well, I guess he does look white in a certain light...

**Oberon:**
And that's it. That's the end of the story.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Haha.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks for looking out for us.


---

**Oberon:**
Feeling better? Then I've got one more recommendation.

**Oberon:**
The city of Gloucester is a day's ride north of here.

**Oberon:**
Every day they hold an auction of curious and rare items there.

**Oberon:**
Seems they just got a very special new product. “An unusual fairy, armed with iron.”

**Oberon:**
They were brought in from the Nameless Forest by some merchants,

**Oberon:**
and are being put up for auction as early as tomorrow morning.

**Artoria:**
Ah! An “unusual fairy armed with iron” in the Nameless Forest!

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, there's no doubt! It's got to be Mash this time!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We need to get to Gloucester right away!|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
By the way, what about those merchants that found her?

**Oberon:**
They didn't want to sell the fairy off at a low price...

**Oberon:**
It's alright if you tell the head of Gloucester “I can't sell at that price,”

**Oberon:**
but they were arrested for previous charges of theft, fraud, and anti-Queen beliefs on top of all that.

**Oberon:**
The head of Gloucester punishes criminal acts with death. I heard they were all hanged last night.


---

**Oberon:**
When I heard that, I rushed back to Salisbury.

**Oberon:**
Then I heard you guys had already left, which gave me a bad feeling.

**Oberon:**
I was able to rush over in a carriage made for transportation, so now I'm in Aurora's debt.

**Artoria:**
I see. That's why you have something so valuable. What fantastic tact.

**Oberon:**
Yeah. To be honest, I'd like to take a break in the autumn woods, but time is money.

**Oberon:**
At this rate we can head straight to Gloucester, right? So long, Salisbury.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Onward, to Gloucester!


---

**Red Rabbit:**
Excuse me. Colt I say something first?

**Da Vinci:**
Wh-what is it, Mr. Horse? We had a pretty good atmosphere here...

**Red Rabbit:**
Yes. I am a proud fairy horse, the most well-bred restive horse in Britain.

**Red Rabbit:**
My back is solely for those I acknowledge as my Lord.

**Red Rabbit:**
Up to now I have towed you as ordered by my Lady Aurora.

**Red Rabbit:**
However, if you are to head to Gloucester&mdash;you understand, correct?

**Artoria:**
How about a carrot?

**Red Rabbit:**
TO BATTLE!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Red Rabbit:**
Neeeeeeeeigh! Contract complete!

**Red Rabbit:**
Such calm, to be so unfazed by my secret techniques...

**Red Rabbit:**
I see that you are a fearless warrior, who has weathered many battles.

**Red Rabbit:**
From mare onwards, I am your feet. I shall accompany you as long as the road travels well.

**Oberon:**
Stuck with a fairy horse like this, doesn't Aurora seem surprisingly unpopular?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, in a way, this is great.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe she's...too popular...


---

**Oberon:**
There's nothing more that has to be said, right? Then let's get heading to Gloucester.

**Oberon:**
Setting myself aside, Fujimaru, Artoria, and da Vinci are all worn out.

**Oberon:**
Drive as safely as you can, please.

**Red Rabbit:**
Please, leave it to me. Not once have I ever broken the speed limit.

**Da Vinci:**
By the way Oberon, what's with those clothes? I liked your cloak from before.

**Oberon:**
Oh, I use this when I'm asking around for gossip.

**Oberon:**
You'll get questioned by the Queen's soldiers if you run around asking about the state of the world right now.

**Oberon:**
That's why I keep a low profile, wearing simple traveler's clothes.

**Artoria:**
I see, not bad Oberon. Even in something like that you're seen as “plain.”

**Oberon:**
Oh, are you into fashion, Artoria? Perhaps, you'd like to try dressing like da Vinci?

**Artoria:**
N-no, that's not true...

**Artoria:**
If I were to mimic da Vinci, I'd be a laughingstock...

**Oberon:**
Mmm, well, you might be right. It's still a little early for you.

**Artoria:**
Hey!

**Oberon:**
Well, that's enough messing with Artoria for today.

**Oberon:**
Fujimaru, da Vinci.

**Oberon:**
Can you tell me what you learned about the state of affairs in the Fairy Kingdom while I was away?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...and that's about it.|


---

**Oberon:**
Hmm. A series of Calamities. Mors. Fairy lifestyle imitating human society.

**Oberon:**
The rebels of Salisbury and the Round Table Army of Londinium.

**Oberon:**
And the three Fairy Knights.

**Oberon:**
Great work. If you know that much, then I only have one thing to share with you.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
One more thing...?|


---

**Oberon:**
Queen Morgan's objective.

**Oberon:**
She inscribes Command Spells on fairies, draws out their magical energy as a tax, and kills those who can't bear it.

**Oberon:**
The reason she's imposed such despotism over the past two thousand years isn't to control this Fairy Kingdom.

**Oberon:**
Morgan's true objective is to assault pan-human history in its entirety&mdash;to “fairify” the entire planet.

**Oberon:**
To expand this Fairy Kingdom, paint over pan-human history, and make Earth a planet of nothing but Britain.

**Oberon:**
It's hard to believe, but it's the truth.

**Oberon:**
Queen Morgan is tormenting the fairies for just this reason.

**Oberon:**
Do you get it? For the sake of both the fairies and the humans, we have to defeat Morgan.

**Morgan's Soldiers:**
Prostrate yourselves. Offer yourselves up.

**Morgan's Soldiers:**
Worship. Submit.

**Morgan's Soldiers:**
The six clan heads, thirty ambassadors, and one hundred government officials gathered here shall bow their heads.

**Morgan's Soldiers:**
The ruler who expands the borders. The ruler who built the Fairy Kingdom.

**Morgan's Soldiers:**
You are in the presence of Her Majesty Queen Morgan. You hear the mantra of Her Majesty Queen Morgan.

**Morgan:**
&mdash;The same faces as always, is it? How tedious. How very tedious.

**Morgan:**
I will not pardon any of you. I will not save any of you.

**Morgan:**
Do not forget. Britain is my property, down to the smallest pebble.

**Morgan:**
Know that without my protection, there is no future for the Fairy Kingdom.

**30 ambassadors, 100 officers:**
“We understand, Your Majesty.” “We are but your loyal servants.”

**30 ambassadors, 100 officers:**
“We offer all our time to you.” “We swear our undying loyalty to you.”

**Morgan:**
&mdash;Hmph. Very well. All you clowns, back against the wall.

**Morgan:**
I shall allow the clan heads to speak. Each of you may share your opinions.

**F：???:**
Ooh, thank you for your generosity, Your Majesty. Then, I shall take the first honor.

**Clerk Yttri:**
Head of the Earth Clan. Lord of Norwich, Lord Spriggan, you may speak.

**Spriggan:**
Yes. According to our observations, the Calamity Pool of Norwich will reach critical mass in about ten days.

**Spriggan:**
Among those here, are there any lords who have left property in Norwich?

**Spriggan:**
If there are, please consult with me later.

**Spriggan:**
Even as the city is swallowed by waves of Mors, Norwich's bell tower remains an impenetrable vault.

**Spriggan:**
It has walls made of Mors-repelling iron, so it would be good to take advantage of this one-time opportunity.

**G：???:**
You're talking about money at a time like this? You seem content with the disappearance of your city.

**Clerk Yttri:**
Head of the Fang Clan. Lord of Oxford, Lord Woodwose, you may speak.

**Woodwose:**
I give the same advice as always. Your Majesty, please think of building up your army.

**Woodwose:**
The Mors increase in number by the year. There are also rebels such as the Round Table Army to deal with.

**Woodwose:**
I humbly request that you increase the number of human shipments, and allocate them to the barracks.

**Spriggan:**
Oh? The Fang Clan alone are not enough for you?

**Spriggan:**
It seems even the great Lord Woodwose, once known as the Sword of the Fairy Kingdom, cannot fight the advance of age.

**Woodwose:**
Shut up, greenhorn. Don't flap your disgusting tongue at me. If you weren't in front of Her Majesty, I'd bite your head off!

**Aurora:**
Now now, please calm down, Woodwose. You are a man of respect among the fairies right now.

**Aurora:**
As the Lord of Oxford,

**Aurora:**
and the owner of a major restaurant franchise that feeds the Fairy Kingdom, you should be more well-mannered. No?

**Woodwose:**
M-mrgh...I know, I know, Aurora.

**Woodwose:**
I'm no longer a thug on the front lines. I'm a reasonable clan leader.

**I：???:**
How boring...

**I：???:**
If this is to be a repeat of our usual bantering, may I leave, Your Majesty?

**I：???:**
I'm busy prepping for the auction. The item in question is very, very rare this time, you see.

**Clerk Yttri:**
Head of the Wing Clan. Lord of Gloucester, Lady Muryan, you may speak.

**Muryan:**
I've already expressed my opinion.

**Muryan:**
The Calamity Pool and “countering the Mors” have nothing to do with my Gloucester.

**Muryan:**
Between fairies of warped character, there will always be quarreling.

**Muryan:**
Ah, but Norwich's products have been superb lately, so I wouldn't mind providing a little assistance.

**Muryan:**
Spriggan, give my regards to Count Peperon.

**Muryan:**
If he is thinking of moving to Gloucester, please convey to him that he would always be welcome.

**???:**
&mdash;.

**Clerk Yttri:**
Head of the King's Clan. Lord of Edinburgh, Lady Knocknarea. No statement due to absence.

**???:**
&mdash;

**Clerk Yttri:**
Head of the Mirror Clan. Guardian of the Lake District, Lady Ainsel. No statement due to absence.

**Clerk Yttri:**
Next, by special dispensation from Her Majesty Morgan, the Fairy Knight of New Darlington&mdash;

**Clerk Yttri:**
G-aagh&mdash;!?

**???:**
Are you for real!? A mere clerk speaking my name, what kinda nerve is that?

**???:**
Hey, Mother, how long until you quit letting the clerks run things?

**???:**
At least use better-looking ones.

**???:**
Like people with their limbs sewn to the wall. Or someone who's been guillotined.

**???:**
Mother, aren't you being a little soft on both the humans and fairies lately? Aren't they getting enough encouragement?

**Government Officials:**
&mdash;

**L：???:**
Oh? Why so silent? It's your job to make a bunch of noise, isn't it?

**L：???:**
If you can't even do that much, then just die. Are you all going to fall prey to my strings here?

**Government Officials:**
O&mdash;ooh! Fairy knight Tristan! You honor us with your presence!

**Government Officials:**
The knight among knights who protects Britain! And more than that&mdash;

**Government Officials:**
Her Majesty's grand and beloved daughter! She who alone in Britain, shall inherit Her Majesty's magecraft!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Yeah yeah, that's enough. So you all can do it if you try.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
But there wasn't that liiiittle twist, was there? It wasn't pathetic enough.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Sooooo, you and you and you. Why don't you be a nice little example for the rest, hmm~♡

**Government Officials:**
Ha-gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!

**Government Officials:**
My foot! My ankle! It's gone, it's gone, it's goooone!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Kyahahahahahaha!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Yeah, bounce bounce! Bounce up and down on the severed part!♡

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Oh, but such bloody violence isn't allowed here. Whatever happened to your manners?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Open the window and jump into the great pit. Don't dirty the floor of the throne room more than you have already.

**Government Officials:**
Ah, no, my body, I can't stop it...! No, no, no no no,

**Government Officials:**
If I fall down that hole, I'm done for! Help, somebody help me! Stop that girl!

**Government Officials:**
Aaaahhhhhh&mdash;!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
All right, that's all settled☆

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
What do you think, mother? This is such a boring conference. Isn't it more fun when it's this noisy?

**Woodwose:**
What the&mdash;that was Camelot's Minister of Justice!

**Woodwose:**
Know your place, Tristan, you madwoman! You're nothing more than a dreg taken in as “daughter”&mdash;

**Morgan:**
Enough. Be silent, Woodwose. This is a family matter.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Look, Her Majesty is pleased. The only one who should know their place is you.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Too bad, so sad, you stupid puppy♡ Why don't you retire already? No matter what, we're stronger than you.

**Woodwose:**
Tch, get off your high horse, little girl!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Cease, Woodwose. Why do you play along with Tristan's games?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You are the head of the Fang Clan. Don't ruin our reputation with your petty temper tantrums.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Damn...the ever-uptight Lord Gawain finally makes her appearance, huh?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
She just saved your life, old man. Next time, your ankles are mine.

**Morgan:**
Give your report, Gawain. What occured at the farm south of here?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Yes.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The insurgents calling themselves the Round Table Army were allowed to take control of the farm.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The guards appointed by the staff of Your Majesty were captured, and the humans in custody attempted to escape.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Without word from Your Majesty, I departed on my own initiative.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Despite wiping out the rebels, the facility was destroyed, and we failed to apprehend three of them.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
In addition, the recaptured humans are currently being transported for re-education.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Please pass down your judgement.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I will accept any made by you, the ruler of Britain.

**Morgan:**
Enough. I shall forgive this disgrace at the southern farm on account of your distinguished service in Sheffield.

**Morgan:**
Raise your head, Gawain. That farm was scheduled for demolition at any rate.

**Morgan:**
This saves me the trouble of having to mobilize the Earth Clan. Although, it was slightly excessive.

**Morgan:**
&mdash;Is there anything else you must tell me?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Yes...among the three who escaped, there was a human...

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It was the one Your Majesty spoke of, the Master of pan-human history.

**Ambassadors:**
The Master of pan-human history...! Then the words of Beryl Gut were correct after all!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
There is one more thing.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The fairy that accompanied the human appeared to be one from the Fairy Kingdom...

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
If I am not mistaken, her appearance is that of a human 16 years of age. A fairy who uses magecraft, the same as Your Majesty.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
&mdash;What was that?

**Woodwose:**
Gawain. Are you implying that this fairy might be the Child of Prophecy?

**Woodwose:**
That's nothing more than Ainsel's lies! There is no true ruler of Britain other than Queen Morgan!

**Woodwose:**
You put stock in gossip like one of those plebeian fairies! How shameful for a servant of the Queen!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Shitty mutt. You're far too loud.

**Spriggan:**
No no, Lord Tristan! Lord Woodwose's irritation is understandable.

**Spriggan:**
To speak of the Child of Prophecy is to speak of the Tintagel affair. Don't you see? The coastal village that sheltered the Child of Prophecy.

**Spriggan:**
The one who razed that village was none other than Lord Woodwose. Unfortunately, he failed to capture the child in question.

**Spriggan:**
The one who broke through the Fang Clan surrounding the village was a blonde girl of about 16 years.

**Spriggan:**
Among a stormy battle, the soldiers whispered to each other.

**Spriggan:**
“The girl uses magecraft.” “The return of the King.”  And even&mdash;“Queen Morgan's daughter.”

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
How dare you duck? Die, Capless.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Got it? I'm Mother's only daughter.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I don't care about any Child of Prophecy, so keep that shitty rumor to yourself.

**Spriggan:**
I hold no such opinion. It is idle gossip of the Fang Clan.

**Spriggan:**
Still, representatives of the upper class, gathered here before the throne of Camelot, what do you think?

**Spriggan:**
The continuing increase of Mors, the omen of disaster for Norwich, Knocknarea in the north, Londinium in the south.

**Spriggan:**
The uprising in Sheffield a few days ago.

**Spriggan:**
And now the trespasser from the outside world, who Sir Beryl Gut warned us of!

**Spriggan:**
I do not place trust in Ainsel's prophecies either, but the circumstances align far too well.

**Spriggan:**
The Child of Prophecy is real.

**Spriggan:**
At the very least, that is what the lower-class fairies unaware of our politics would believe.

**Spriggan:**
This is not a situation where our clans can squabble with one another. We must not increase the anxiety of the people any further.

**Spriggan:**
Why don't we all band together, and settle the issue of the Calamity Pool of Norwich first?

**Aurora:**
I agree. Setting aside the issue of the Child of Prophecy, the Calamity Pool over Norwich cannot be overlooked.

**Aurora:**
Would it be possible to dispatch Her Majesty's armies to Norwich, for the purpose of targeting the Calamity in the near future?

**Aurora:**
Was not such an appeal made by the Lord of Sheffield, Lord Boggart?

**Woodwose:**
Aurora. I understand your feelings, but we can't send out the soldiers of Camelot.

**Woodwose:**
It's true that if Queen Morgan fully mobilized her forces, the Calamity could be wiped clean away.

**Woodwose:**
However, there is a danger of Camelot falling in that time.

**Woodwose:**
Knocknarea of the north is keeping a sharp eye out for just such a gap. We can't leave the castle undermanned.

**Muryan:**
Mm. The way things are, it'll be the War of Spring and War of Summer all over again.

**Muryan:**
The battle this time will be between Her Majesty and the self-proclaimed queen, Knocknarea.

**Muryan:**
It seems like our warpower is only barely better than hers.

**Spriggan:**
The Spring and Summer Wars...the name in the fairy calendar for the wars between the northern and southern fairies, if I'm not mistaken?

**Spriggan:**
The fairies of the north have claimed dominion over Britain for many thousands of years before.

**Spriggan:**
They've been quietly obeying Queen Morgan for the past several hundred years, but to think they'd try to take the throne again...

**Spriggan:**
Aah, this is most distressing! We all swore an oath of allegiance to the Queen!

**Spriggan:**
This is no time to be preoccupied with Norwich.

**Spriggan:**
As Lord of Norwich, I am ashamed to say it, but the citizens of Norwich must be abandoned—

**Morgan:**
Do not fear. I shall use the Water Mirror on Norwich.

**Morgan:**
The Calamity will destroy the greater part of the city, but the bell tower shall remain.

**Morgan:**
So long as the fortress remains standing, the job of reconstruction is yours and yours alone, Spriggan.

**Morgan:**
Show me once more the prowess that allowed you to snatch control of Norwich from your predecessors.

**Spriggan:**
If such be your will, Your Majesty. Then, how much is my grant?

**Morgan:**
I shall grant you thirty percent of the flotsam in the western vaults.

**Morgan:**
It is little more than garbage drifting ashore from pan-human history, but what could be a better reward for you?

**Spriggan:**
Ooh, oooh...! How marvelous, my eternal thanks, Your Majesty!

**Aurora:**
But...this does nothing to save the people of Norwich...

**Aurora:**
Can you not begin evacuating the citizens now, Spriggan?

**Spriggan:**
We have already issued an evacuation order. However, nobody wants to leave the city.

**Spriggan:**
Attachment to their land or job, a lack of appreciation for the danger, faith in the Child of Prophecy...

**Spriggan:**
It could be any mixture of these reasons. Although my own from the Earth Clan should not be so stubborn.

**Spriggan:**
And even should they be evacuated, where would they go? Your own Salisbury, city of the Wind Clan?

**Spriggan:**
You know that the Earth and Wind are at loggerheads. It is a problem even Her Majesty has difficulty with.

**Spriggan:**
Things rarely work out the way they should. The sacrifice of Norwich is unavoidable&mdash;

**???:**
As a matter of fact, I disagree on that point. I believe that the poor, displaced refugees can be well taken care of.

**???:**
Isn't that right, Lady Spinel? Wouldn't New Darlington be able to welcome them with open arms?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
!!! Yes, you're right, Red Beryl! You've been listening to this boring twaddle!

**Beryl:**
Oh no, my sharp-tongued young lady. It's not boring in the least.

**Beryl:**
Haven't all the normally-bickering clan heads gathered here together to worry about Britain's future?

**Beryl:**
There's no show quite as entertaining as this. Well, there's no other shows in this Fairy Kingdom!

**Spriggan:**
Please excuse me, everyone. I've suddenly changed my mind.

**Spriggan:**
Lady Aurora. We shall meet to discuss the details of Salisbury accepting the refugees later.

**Spriggan:**
It is better than sending them to the National Slaughter Theatre in New Darlington. Let the problems of the Fairy Kingdom be solved by its people.

**Woodwose:**
Oxford will accept them as well.

**Woodwose:**
The smiths of the Earth Clan who break the rules are a pain, but letting them die helplessly is against my principles.

**Muryan:**
Gloucester's neutrality will not change.

**Muryan:**
We shall accept not just refugees, but fairies who wish to escape the bonds of their clan.

**Beryl:**
Huh? Suddenly you're all buddy-buddy with each other? Do you all hate me that much?

**Beryl:**
How sad. And yet I'm Her Majesty Morgan's first ever lover, and the future King of Britain!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Yeah, Beryl! Hurry up and get married with Mother, get married!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's so wonderfully twisted that the greatest fairy in Britain will end up wed to a human!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
And then you're going to marry me next, right?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Humans can get married to as many partners as they like, right?

**Beryl:**
Of course, Lady Spinel. But you should give it a little more time.

**Beryl:**
No matter how big a crush you have, as soon as they're in the hands of someone else, it matters no longer&mdash;

**Beryl:**
Stuff like that is common in love affairs. You can't be sure it won't happen to you too.

**Beryl:**
When you see me become the husband of your mother the Queen, that fever of yours might suddenly cool down.

**Beryl:**
Be careful about your decision to get married. You might be closer to your soulmate than you know, right?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Ha, as if! I'm crazy about you!

**Woodwose:**
&mdash;

**Morgan:**
Very well. I have received all your expectations.

**Morgan:**
As I have declared, my plan will not change.

**Morgan:**
“At the end of 2017 of the Queen's Calendar, my Fairy Kingdom will become the ruler of this planet.”

**Morgan:**
I shall destroy the wall of light surrounding Britain, and overwrite the evils of the outside world with our own world.

**Morgan:**
Only then will you all be freed from the hands of the Calamity, and a new era shall be ushered in.

**Morgan:**
I will build a new Fairyland on the Earth's surface. The death of your clans will lay its foundation.

**B：Fairies:**
&mdash;By your will. All according to the Queen's will!

**Morgan:**
Hmph. Then I shall hand down my decision.

**Morgan:**
Norwich shall remain as it is. There is no need for an evacuation order.

**Morgan:**
I consider the Child of Prophecy to be slightly more dangerous. For they pose a direct threat to my throne.

**Morgan:**
One more thing. The invader from pan-human history that Beryl Gut speaks of...

**Morgan:**
When they are found, I want them captured, not killed. I wish to evaluate them myself.

**Morgan:**
If Gawain's confirmation that the Master is travelling with the Child of Prophecy is true, then that is convenient.

**Morgan:**
Woodwose, Spriggan, Muryan, and Aurora.

**Morgan:**
Each of you will begin searching with your troops.

**Morgan:**
Traitors and invaders. Bring them all before my throne.

**Morgan:**
I shall bestow five hundred acres of territory on the clan that achieves this.

**Morgan:**
This ends your audience. The clan heads may withdraw.

**Morgan:**
I shall grant the Fairy Knights their next task. As before, there shall be no need for you to search for the Child of Prophecy.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I don't get it. What use are the clans, Mother?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
If you want a hunt, then am I not good enough? Lancelot's just fast.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I can go anywhere with the Infinity Mirror you gave me, so...

**Morgan:**
No need. You shall not lay a hand on the Child of Prophecy.

**Morgan:**
This is my decree. Fairy Knight Gawain, I entrust the rest to you.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
By Your Majesty's command. Try and behave yourself, Tristan.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Our Queen was strict with you because she was in front of the clan heads.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
No matter how powerful Her Majesty is, she must behave as a queen.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
She cannot speak to you as a daughter. It is your behavior towards Beryl Gut that is the problem in the first place.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Her Majesty's daughter becoming intimate with a human man...and the Queen's lover? Even in jest, what's gotten into you?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Consider Her Majesty's position, the rumors about you, and your morals as a knight.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Huh? Shut it, who do you think you are, you ogre?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's hilarious that you, the one who's been EATING your lovers one after another, would be worried about my reputation!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
How many new boyfriends have you made this year? You're pretty slutty for someone with a body like that, you know.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Could you give me some lovemaking tips sometime?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Well, you discard them right after you've taken a bite, so I guess it's more an appetite than love!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You insolent little&mdash;

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Oh, just kidding! I know, I know, don't look at me that way!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I know that your love is always the real thing.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Because you're awkward, Gawain. You'd never two-time or anything like that, would you?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
“Gawain of many lovers,” “Gluttonous Gawain.”  Aah, how pathetic! The world doesn't understand at all!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
You only become lovers with those you truly care about!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I'm returning to the castle. You, too, should wait like a good little girl for orders.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Seriously, what an irritating meeting. I didn't get to spend time with Mother again, and...

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Woodwose's stench is the worst. It's like the stink of a beast mixed with perfume.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Spriggan's forced laughter is nauseating, and Muryan's goody two-shoes act is so transparent.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
And that Aurora is the worst of all! I'd tear her to shreds, if only I had a reason!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I hope she screws up soon.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
If she was involved somehow with the rebels, I could crush all of Salisbury...

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Are you listening, Beryl!? Huh, he's gone? He was in front of the mirror just a second ago.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Ah, I see. He's at the theatre, huh?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Today, there's a show on featuring the humans we caught.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Forcing the humans to fight each other, and letting the winner survive...slave swordsmen, was it?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
At first I thought it was a pain, but it turned out to be fun!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Especially at the very end! Like, the champion can earn their freedom!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
How can humans be so hilarious! There's no way that's happening, idiots!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Wait...this is no time for me to be laughing.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Mother did say that...but I can't stand it...I can't let this pass...

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Who does this Child of Prophecy think they are anyway? Using magecraft? Morgan's daughter? Someone other than me?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
A piece of trash like that, I'll kill you! Aaaagh, geez, this pisses me off so much!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Well then☆times like this call for shopping!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Where's the newspaper...ah, now let's see...

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Gloucester's Knocker Company withdraws... time to switch up the trends...

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Huh, Spriggan's is going out of business.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Hmm. Spriggan himself aside, I really liked that place...

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Huh? But wait, the one coming next is...

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Just as I thought, it's the Count's shop! As expected, Muryan, you always know what's hot right now!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
After all, if you're shopping, Gloucester is the place to be. She said she was preparing for an auction...

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
All right, then. I'll give you an auction you'll never forget♡

**--ARROW--:**

**Artoria:**
Look, look Fujimaru! You can see the city in the distance!

**Artoria:**
It took all day, but we finally reached Gloucester!

**Oberon:**
Aah, if we've made it this far, we shouldn't have to worry about the Queen's soldiers chasing us.

**Oberon:**
Gloucester is the territory of Muryan, of the Wing Clan. Fighting is strictly forbidden here.

**Oberon:**
There's no fighting with the other clans, nor are they completely beholden to Queen Morgan.

**Oberon:**
According to Muryan, this is an independent autonomous region, and they're “only engaged in diplomacy with Her Majesty's Fairy Kingdom.”

**Oberon:**
Or so she once declared, to all of Britain.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So Morgan's army can't attack us here?|


---

**Oberon:**
Morgan can't raise her hand against Gloucester that easily. You see...hey, da Vinci.

**Oberon:**
Don't you think the atmosphere is different in this area? Like the density of mana.

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I wanted to confirm that.

**Da Vinci:**
Mechanical devices work fine, but the ones powered by magical energy are under-operating.

**Da Vinci:**
Could this be because the very characteristics of Mystery in the atmosphere here&mdash;the rules of this world are different from elsewhere?

**Oberon:**
You got it. Let me tell you a little fairytale.

**Oberon:**
This isn't exclusive to the Fairy Kingdom of Britain, but is shared by pan-human history. You might learn something useful here.

**Oberon:**
In pan-human history, there are various types of fae.

**Oberon:**
Those that have fallen from the rank of a god. A collection of human and animal grudges, and dregs of their souls.

**Oberon:**
Latent thoughts with nowhere else to go, reborn as empty human gossip.

**Oberon:**
These fae arise from human society, and aren't the genuine article, strictly speaking.

**Oberon:**
Genuine fae are those that come from the inner sea of the planet, disconnected from human civilization.

**Oberon:**
Those born in the inner sea of the planet are known in the world of magecraft as “Great Fathers” or “Great Mothers”.

**Oberon:**
You can think of them like... something like bunrei of the planet's soul, or something to that extent.

**Oberon:**
They're on the same scope as divinity who personify nature, but unlike those gods, they're not clothed in human rules.

**Oberon:**
Great Fathers and Mothers are pure, transcendent existences.

**Oberon:**
Fae of these ranks who appear on the surface on a mission from the planet are known in this Lostbelt as “Sub-bells”, or “A-Reis”.

**Oberon:**
The fairy who lent King Arthur the holy sword in pan-human history is one of these “Great Mothers”.

**Oberon:**
Pan-human history Morgan also probably inherited the authority of such a Great Mother.

**Oberon:**
Well, Morgan's father was Uther, Britain's former king, so I guess that makes her a hybrid of both human and fairy.

**Oberon:**
King Arthur, on the other hand, is a hybrid of human and dragon.

**Oberon:**
The two of them may seem similar, but there are some fundamental differences.

**Artoria:**
Hmm. Where does that difference lie?

**Oberon:**
The difference is in what they protect in the end, is it the 'human side' or the 'mystical side'?

**Oberon:**
King Arthur chose the Britain where humans live, whereas Morgan chose the Britain where “Mystery” lives.

**Oberon:**
Well, in hindsight, pan-human history proves which was the correct choice.

**Oberon:**
If it had remained a place where Mystery ruled, Britain would have departed from the stage of human history.

**Oberon:**
Sorry, I'm getting off-topic here.

**Oberon:**
“A-Reis” are Great Mother-class fae who have come into “a will of their own”,

**Oberon:**
their own truth...the essence of a fairy like that is capable of reshaping the world as they see fit.

**Oberon:**
This is the fairy's territory. The greatest Mystery possessed by powerful fairies.

**Oberon:**
Furthermore, just by existing, A-Reis increase their number of terminals, called “offspring”.

**Oberon:**
These offspring are the “Children of the Forest” or the “Children of the Stone”, and make up the greater majority of the fairies in the fairy kingdom these days.

**Oberon:**
Compared to an A-Rei, their power is infinitesimal, but offspring are still offspring.

**Oberon:**
Some of them inherited more A-Rei blood than others. Gloucester's Muryan is one of those few.

**Oberon:**
That's the reason Gloucester sits in the middle of such a troublesome fairy territory.

**Oberon:**
Muryan's mentality is given form here through a rule called “denial of strength”.

**Da Vinci:**
Denial of strength...like a reversal of some sort?

**Oberon:**
That was fashionable back in the day, but not anymore.

**Oberon:**
Currently, you can't bring “acquired strength” into Gloucester.

**Oberon:**
Anyone and everyone&mdash;even Morgan, returns to their level of strength at birth when they enter Gloucester.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Meaning, a city where everyone becomes level 1...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It seems impartial at first glance, but...


---

**Oberon:**
Right. The more rules people make, the more loopholes they introduce to exploit.

**Oberon:**
Maybe Muryan is an exception to that rule.

**Oberon:**
Consequently, in Gloucester, nobody can oppose Muryan. Be sure to remember that.

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm. Is the term “A-Rei” unique to this Lostbelt?

**Da Vinci:**
They sound similar to what we call things like “Elemental” or “True Ancestor”.

**Da Vinci:**
So, are there any other fairies that have inherited the A-Rei's powers?

**Da Vinci:**
The clan heads, for example. Is Aurora within a fairy territory?

**Artoria:**
No. Fairies with that kind of power fall outside the clan structure.

**Artoria:**
They're pursued by fairies from their own clan, or perish when they can no longer handle their own territorial rules...

**Oberon:**
Yeah. Among the six clan heads, the only ones who can force their territory on others are Muryan and Knocknarea.

**Oberon:**
Most of the other “territory holders” have perished, and have become wraiths wandering around Britain.

**Oberon:**
They're called the Fairy Deadlords, or Nightcall. Some believe they're even more terrifying than the fairy knights.

**Red Rabbit:**
Everyone, we will soon reach Gloucester.

**Red Rabbit:**
As you can see, as a member of the Fang Clan, entering Gloucester would be too difficult for me...

**Red Rabbit:**
I shall make camp in this area, so please call me when it is time to leave.

**Red Rabbit:**
Is that all right? Please do not misunderstand.

**Red Rabbit:**
I may look like this, but I am definitely one of the Fang Clan. Not one of the Wind Clan. This may be surprising.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure...seems that way...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can see that.


---

**Oberon:**
All right, gang, let's split up.

**Oberon:**
Myself with da Vinci, Fujimaru with Artoria.

**Oberon:**
The auction's tonight. You're free until then.

**Oberon:**
Any sort of behavior is acceptable in Gloucester. Everyone can make as much of a racket as they want.

**Oberon:**
You've got the money you earned in Salisbury? You can use it in Gloucester too, so spend it however you want.

**Oberon:**
Well, da Vinci, is there anywhere you'd like to go?

**Oberon:**
The cafe is nice, but I recommend the Distortion Observation Deck. It's so amazing, you'll get dizzy and want to throw up!

**Da Vinci:**
Wait, you're already heading there! You just decided on your own!

**Da Vinci:**
You two, I know this is sudden, but you'll be fine, right? Right? Then you do the same as well.

**Da Vinci:**
Hold on, Oberon! Isn't there an art museum or something here!?

**Da Vinci:**
There's so many different kinds of fairies in this Lostbelt, shouldn't there be some sort of “painter fairy” too!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|


---

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...and off they go...|

**Artoria:**
S-seems so.

**Artoria:**
It's just me and you now, Fujimaru...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...anyway, should we go?

**Artoria:**
That was fast!

**Artoria:**
Oh, ah, I'm sorry...It was just so sudden I lost my composure...deep breaths, deep breaths...


---

**Artoria:**
Well, there's no point in coming all this way just to hesitate!

**Artoria:**
We're finally in Gloucester, so let's enjoy ourselves! Let me show you around!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wow, so this is the city of Gloucester!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something's not quite right here!


---

**Artoria:**
It really is strange, isn't it? The first time I came here I felt the same way.

**Artoria:**
Things in the distance appear larger, things that are closer appear smaller...

**Artoria:**
Sometimes it rains pink, or the main street is covered with rainbows...

**Artoria:**
Boys turning into girls, girls turning into boys...

**Artoria:**
Anyway, what's trendy here changes rapidly. When I came before&mdash;when I came I&mdash;

**Artoria:**
...scored a zero...in the princess contest...

**Artoria:**
...stripped of my clothes...by a girl wearing a scarf made of worm silk...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's enough, that's enough! I don't need to know more!|

**Artoria:**
I see...I was only just getting started...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why your clothes!?

**Artoria:**
...what I was wearing was unfashionable...I wonder what she's doing now...

**Artoria:**
...If she's doing fine I'll be devastated...I have to get revenge next time...


---

**Passing Fairy:**
Oh. Haven't seen you two around. Are you visiting because you heard about today's auction?

**Passing Fairy:**
My. You sure can make a human stand out.

**Passing Fairy:**
The current trend in Gloucester is “possessions that make others envious”.

**Passing Fairy:**
Going for a plain look while dressing up your human squire to be eye-catching, huh...

**Passing Fairy:**
Great idea, I'm going to copy that!

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Artoria's making that face again...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I'm starting to understand... little by little...)


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry. Could you tell us more about the auction?|


---

**Passing Fairy:**
You mean, in detail, like, the goods that are being auctioned off? “A fairy with an iron weapon”, right?

**Passing Fairy:**
I heard it's a vile creature from another world that opposes the Queen..

**Passing Fairy:**
If you're a criminal, there's no problem with others treating you like a slave. I'd participate in the auction too, but...

**Passing Fairy:**
They're saying you need an invitation this time, so I won't bother. Instead, I'll go have some fun at a soiree.

**Artoria:**
I'm sorry...I just froze up. I was supposed to ask her for information...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's alright, it's alright. Take it easy.|

**Artoria:**
Yes. I was so nervous. Thanks to you, I was able to relax.

**Artoria:**
So, about that invitation we were told about...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
More importantly, about the invitation...


---

**Artoria:**
We can't get one. They're only given to high-ranking fairies.

**Artoria:**
I can't say this out loud, but we have no choice but to sneak into the auction venue.

**Artoria:**
But don't worry, infiltration is my magecraft's specialty!

**Artoria:**
All riiight! This time I'm going to show you how cool I am~!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
S-sure.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(What is this feeling of déjà vu...)


---

**Voices from Afar:**
Somebody! Anybody out there!

**Voices from Afar:**
Catch them, catch theeem! The breeding rats have escaped from their cages!

**Voices from Afar:**
I'll give you a reward if you catch them! Pleeaaase!

**Artoria:**
...? There's some kind of small creature coming from over there in droves...

**Artoria:**
What do we do, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's catch them!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This is turning into a really long sidequest chain...!)


---

**Artoria:**
...ah, I see, you're still not used to this... well, it can't be helped...

**Artoria:**
No, I'm just talking to myself. We're about to get into a fight, so don't worry about it.

**Artoria:**
I'm sure you won't like it, but...Just look at it like another lesson free of charge.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...?|


---

**--BATTLE--:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rats, huh.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My eyes still sting...

**Artoria:**
Big things look small...and small things look big...

**Artoria:**
Things like this happen in Gloucester. Did you learn something from this?

**Grateful Fairy:**
Thanks! You sure like to do some weird things in your free time! Here's a coupon in appreciation.

**Grateful Fairy:**
See ya! I'm gonna make a fortune with these rats!

**Artoria:**
We got a coupon. “The Safe and Amazing Knocker Company...”

**Artoria:**
Wait, this is from S&C! You know, Spriggan & Capless!

**Artoria:**
The first comprehensive department store in the kingdom, built 100 years ago! The old man told me about it!

**Artoria:**
And, according to the map, we're close! Let's go, Fujimaru!

**Artoria:**
......

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like they're going out of business...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That fairy from before...


---

**Artoria:**
There's already a new store being built...the brand is “Count”...I've never heard of them, but...

**Artoria:**
The shoes, bags, the hat, that dress...

**Artoria:**
Wow, the stuff on display in the window is all so coooool!

**Artoria:**
It's so cute and sparkly, yet so elegant and fun to wear!

**Red-haired Fairy:**
I know what you mean. You've got a pretty good sense of style.

**Red-haired Fairy:**
But could you pipe down a bit?

**Red-haired Fairy:**
I'd rather not stand out. I came here in secret.

**Artoria:**
I-I'm sorry...I was born in a small village, so I just...

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Ah, I see. What, with your village about to be hit by the Calamity, you escaped to the city before you died?

**Red-haired Fairy:**
You're lucky. You're not just another cocky Gloucester fairy.

**Red-haired Fairy:**
And your ankles aren't to my taste. Be thankful you've got such awful boots.

**Artoria:**
I-Is that so? ....they're unfashionable, huh? I see...

**Artoria:**
They're practical though...you'd be fine if you got bitten by an Awd Goggie...

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Pfft. What kind of country bumpkin story is that, being bitten by a Goggie!

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Judging by your looks, you're with the Wind Clan, right? And not bad-looking even by their standards.

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Yet you're working in a field despite that? Well, there aren't many slaves on the frontiers&mdash;

At least&mdash;

**Artoria:**
I-i-it's not that strange, is it?

**Artoria:**
Fujimaru and I, we're just not used to city fairies yet....

**Red-haired Fairy:**
...not used to it yet, huh...I see, that's why you're not scared when you see me.

**Red-haired Fairy:**
...but what is it? It's not just that...

**Red-haired Fairy:**
(Why am I not irritated...? I hate all fairies, and yet...)

**Red-haired Fairy:**
...well, I guess it's an off day for me. I'm headed to the auction later today.

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Oh, you're interested in the auction? But, do you have an invitation?

**Artoria:**
Uh...yeah.

**Artoria:**
Actually, we came all the way here for the auction...

**Artoria:**
But we didn't know you needed an invitation to get into the venue, so...

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Is that so. Invitations...

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Hehe. I have some left over, but I'm not sharing~.

**Red-haired Fairy:**
I'd rather feed them to the goats than give them to you!

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Yeah, yeah, those faces suit you! Know your places, bumpkins!

**Red-haired Fairy:**
You got it? Kids like you are a hundred years too young to be taking part in an auction.

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Try again when you're a little more grown up. Ahh, but&mdash;

**Red-haired Fairy:**
Low-class fairies don't even last a hundred years, do they? Why don't you crawl on your hands and knees in the dirt for the rest of your sorry lives?

**Artoria:**
&mdash; (dumbfounded)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...what an uncanny fairy...|

**Artoria:**
...wasn't she? I must have said something she didn't like...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know...there was something off...

**Artoria:**
Did we just become friends in some strange way?

**Artoria:**
W-well, maybe. I didn't get a bad impression just now, so...


---

**--ARROW--:**

**Oberon:**
Oh, the invitation? Naturally, I already got my hands on one. What about it?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'd expect nothing less, Oberon.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Guess we'll use Artoria's grand magecraft some other time.


---

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
Unfortunately, we couldn't prepare any formal attire. Well, Oberon is already pretty flashy,

**Da Vinci:**
and we're his friends, so... I guess they'll let us in.

**Oberon:**
Of course. Muryan and I have a bit of a thing going. We'll be able to get into the VIP section.

**Oberon:**
The real problem will be when the auction begins. Mash is the main lot, so she won't be brought out until the end.

**Oberon:**
I've got 70 million morpounds on me. It's counterfeit, but so long as they don't figure that out tonight, it won't be a problem.

**Oberon:**
The question is, if we're able to compete with the other bidders.

**Oberon:**
I can't afford to lose more money, but this time the product is what it is...

**Oberon:**
This is gonna be rough...If we're unlucky, I might have to remortgage the entire Welsh forest...

**Artoria:**
Seventy million is enough to buy an entire estate, with a full suite of servants, isn't it?

**Artoria:**
If even THAT isn't enough, than what the heck are they advertising this fairy as?

**Oberon:**
Well, try and keep your hats on when you hear this: “A fairy armed with iron weapons, a traveller from another world.”

**Oberon:**
And&mdash;“The new Child of Prophecy.”

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Ladies and gentlemen who have gathered here.

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
I bid you all welcome to Gloucester's auction house.

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
From the dreams of tomorrow, to the dreams of today. From pride in one's clan, to pride in oneself.

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
In order to meet your desires, we have prepared a variety of items for you tonight.

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Have you all sampled the catalog yet? Here it is! Have you found an item that catches your attention?

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Magnificient. Everyone appears to be completely absorbed. This concludes the opening remarks.

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Well then&mdash;Please enjoy Lady Muryan's exhibition to your heart's content!

**Artoria:**
(The auction is starting...! I see, you have to announce your bid directly...)

**Da Vinci:**
(Usually, the buyer signals secretly, and the one who bids on the item is generally their agent.)

**Da Vinci:**
(I guess this auction doesn't recognize agents. You have to bid with your own voice to the bitter end, huh?)

**Oberon:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? What is it, Oberon?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you getting restless?

**Oberon:**
(You see lot number 3 in the catalog? “Shakespeare's Dead Manuscript.”)

**Oberon:**
(It might be flotsam washed ashore from pan-human history in the exchange the changeling...)

**Oberon:**
(Now I'm interested...I can afford to spend just a little... no, now I have to...alright, here comes my bid...!)

**Da Vinci:**
(Oh no you don't! We're here for lot 9, the “Child of Prophecy!” And, if you bid on something now, they'll know the money is fake by the time they bring her out!)

**Da Vinci:**
(Patience, patience! I mean, if you're an artist too, then one of my works should be enough!)

**Oberon:**
(Wait, seriously!? I thought I'd look too much like a fanboy if I ever asked, but you'd really do it?!)

**Oberon:**
(Promise, da Vinci! Make it a portrait of me, please!)

(...I guess he's used to this sort of thing. I was nervous, but thanks to him, it's not so bad anymore.)

**Artoria:**
(...We should keep a low profile until the end. It'll be bad if we stand out too much.)

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
And now, the last lot of the day.

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
We finally come to what you have all been waiting for. The accursed traitor and threat to our Queen,

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
the victorious child, foretold to save Britain by the honorable Lady Ainsel herself!

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Attacking Camelot wielding a never-before-seen iron weapon,

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
the brave hero who escaped certain death in the Great Pit, and who returned alive from the Nameless Forest!

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Is the prophecy actually true? Ascertain that with your own eyes, ladies and gentlemen!

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Lot number, Final! I give to you, the “Child of Prophecy”!

**E：Child of Prophecy?:**
...

**Artoria:**
Huh?

**Da Vinci:**
Whaaaaaaat!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Old maaaaaaaan!?|


---

**E：Muramasa of Prophecy:**
Well, I'm SORRY for bein' a geezer!

**E：Muramasa of Prophecy:**
Wait, who the hell called me that just now!?

**S：Auctioneer Fairy:**
Everyone, if you could please calm down!

**S：Auctioneer Fairy:**
This man may have a very foul mouth and attitude, but his magical energy is considerable!

**S：Auctioneer Fairy:**
He can produce marvelous items, beyond even the skill of the smiths of Norwich.

**S：Auctioneer Fairy:**
It is said the Child of Prophecy was the student of a master craftsman.

**S：Auctioneer Fairy:**
Lady Muryan gave her approval, saying “Isn't he at least 20%, no, 30% of the Child of Prophecy?”

**E：Muramasa, 30% Child of Prophecy:**
Shut up. I told you a thousand times, I ain't no “Child of Prophecy”!

**E：Muramasa, 30% Child of Prophecy:**
I'm Senji Muramasa, a lone wolf Servant! Now let me out of this goddamn cage!

**Da Vinci:**
I can't even comprehend this, but that's Muramasa! Senji Muramasa, one of the Alien God's apostles!

**Da Vinci:**
What is he doing in Britain!? No, wait, why is he up for auction!?

**Artoria:**
You know him!? Then, that person isn't Mash!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. He's definitely not Mash...but...|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's not enough of a stranger to just ignore!|


---

**Oberon:**
&mdash;a Servant. So he's a Servant too, huh? Well then&mdash;

**Oberon:**
The fairies here don't know what Servants are. They can't tell the difference between Servants and fairies.

**Oberon:**
“Comes from the outside world.” “Armed with iron weapons.” “A traitor who opposes the Queen.”

**Oberon:**
How could that not be the Child of Prophecy!? But this all just feels like a scam!

**Artoria:**
What are we gonna do!? The bidding's already begun!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course, we're gonna save him!|


---

**Oberon:**
Got it, leave it to me! Good thing the folks around us are all “what, were you expecting someone different?”

**Oberon:**
Seventy million is enough to compete in this atmosphere. Let's test the waters with a 1 million opener!

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
We start the bidding at 1 million morpounds! Two million! Three million! Four million! Four and a half million! ...Five million!

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Lady Artoria and her entourage bid five million morpounds! Are there any other bids?

**Artoria:**
(Why drop my name like that!?)

**Oberon:**
(It's more exciting this way, right? “The Child of Prophecy, bought personally by none other than the Child of Prophecy...”)

**Oberon:**
(A hilarious twist of fate like that will definitely go down in the history of Gloucester!)

**Artoria:**
(OBEROOOOOONNNNN!!!)

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Five million, five million morpounds, going once, going twi&mdash;We have another bid! Ten million! Ten million! The bidding is heating up!

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Ten million, ten million, do we have any other interested parties!?

**Oberon:**
(Damn. This is bad. Stop, stop! Seriously, we've got to fold here!)

**Artoria:**
Twenty million! Twenty million morpounds! Aaah, what a pain! Seventy million! How do you like me now, HUH!?

**Oberon:**
(Artoria! Are you actually some kind of wild animal!?)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, she gets like that sometimes.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She might have gone a bit overboard this time.


---

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Seventy million! Seventy million morpounds! We have a winner, sold to&mdash;

**The Other Bidder:**
&mdash;One hundred million morpounds.

**The Other Bidder:**
I don't know what sort of nouveau riche clan you come from, but you should know your place.

**The Other Bidder:**
If I'm outbid by someone like you, it'll be the end of Britain.

**Artoria:**
There's no way we're losing here! Then...then&mdash;

**Artoria:**
One hundred and one million morpounds, putting Oberon's land down as collateral&mdash;!!!

**Oberon:**
(Have you gone insane!? My land isn't worth even ten million!)

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Ooh...ooh...this auction has fallen out of my control.

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Lady Muryan, please deliver us your verdict!

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Which one of these buyers is actually going to be able to pay!?

**N：Voice from the Stage:**
Very well. The auctioneer will stand down, please.

**N：Voice from the Stage:**
Because the judgement has become such a difficult matter, I, Muryan, will take over from here.

**N：Muryan:**
The item up for auction is the Child of Prophecy, regardless of whether or not it's the genuine article.

**N：Muryan:**
The one who buys it must have not only capital, but also sufficient dignity.

**N：Muryan:**
Will the two remaining bidders please come up to the stage?

**The Other Bidder:**
Hah, so true. I like the way you think, Muryan.

**The Other Bidder:**
When it comes to grace, I can't possibly lose. This'll be a public execution of some upstart new-money clan.

**Da Vinci:**
Wah, inviting them up to the stage!? How is this even still an auction!?

**Da Vinci:**
Oberon, is this also one of Gloucester's quirks!?

**Oberon:**
Nope, I've never seen this before either. Damn it, Muryan...what are you up to?

**Oberon:**
Artoria, take your seat and calm down. This is some kind of trap.

**Oberon:**
Once you get onstage, this is going to turn out very badl—why is her seat empty?

**Da Vinci:**
Too little, too late, Oberon.

**Da Vinci:**
Artoria's already taken Fujimaru's hand and gone up to the stage.

**Oberon:**
You're acting on the first thing that pops up in your head, girl!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Before I knew it, I was brought up on stage.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What have I done to deserve this?


---

**Artoria:**
Please fight by my side! I'm hopeless all by myself!

**Muryan:**
Then, would you be so kind as to introduce yourself, Lady Spinel?

**Muryan:**
Or should I refer to you as Lady Tristan, the Fairy Knight?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Sure. I have no problem with that name.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Daughter of Queen Morgan, and the expression of blood. The fairy clad in the most gorgeous of dresses.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Fairy Knight Tristan. Daughter of the Queen, who will one day come to own all of Britain.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
&mdash;your turn now, sweetheart. Why don't you share your shabby name with us?

**Artoria:**
(What do we do, Fujimaru! She's the fairy from earlier today...!)

**Artoria:**
(She was actually one of the Fairy Knights... and Morgan's daughter on top of that!? What kind of sick plot twist is this?!)

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Ah, as I expected, no introduction.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Well, it's no wonder. There's no fairy with greater pedigree than me, after all.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
You were all talk, but in the end&mdash;...hey, you're... the ones from earlier today...

**C：Muryan:**
Allow me to introduce them.

**C：Muryan:**
This girl is a fairy from Tintagel, and will be turning 16 this year.

**C：Muryan:**
The miracle child who escaped Woodwose's siege, and taught herself magecraft just like Her Majesty.

**C：Muryan:**
Ladies and gentlemen, please take a good look. The staff in her hands is the Staff of Selection.

**C：Muryan:**
Her name is Artoria. The true Child of Prophecy.

**Muryan:**
And the servant standing beside her is a traveller from another world.

**Muryan:**
The traveling star said to guide the Child of Prophecy. One of the lights that will save Britain.

**Muryan:**
A Master from pan-human history, a human named Fujimaru.

**Artoria:**
Wh&mdash;They don't just know about me, they know about Fujimaru too!

**Muryan:**
Please do not get violent, Lady Tristan. The bidding has not ended yet.

**Muryan:**
Once you two step onto the auction stage, you are obligated to bid on the item.

**Muryan:**
However...how troublesome...the Fairy Knight, Lady Tristan, and the Child of Prophecy, Lady Artoria...

**Muryan:**
Your worth has been assessed as roughly equal.

**Muryan:**
Competition between wealth and dignity is no longer possible.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Me, the same as her!? Have your eyes turned rotten!?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I'm better in every single way! She can't compete with me in either strength or beauty!

**Muryan:**
So you say. What do you think, our guest from another world?

**Muryan:**
In your eyes, who has more merit, Tristan or Artoria?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria.|

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Tristan.

**Artoria:**
Shaddup! I think so too, but you don't have to say that, Fujimaru!

**Artoria:**
This isn't about merit anymore. It's a battle of the soul!

**Artoria:**
Girl&ndash;the only thing that comes out of your mouth is boonies this, hicks that, is that all you can say!?

**Artoria:**
Maybe take a good look at your own upbringing first, stupid IDIOT!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Wh&mdash;What did you just say...!?


---

**Muryan:**
Then, what of magecraft?

**Muryan:**
Both of you are practitioners of magecraft, considered “useless” in Britain.

**Muryan:**
Magecraft on its own has little value, however the fairies who practice it are few and far between.

**Muryan:**
The “Child of the Queen” and the “Child of Prophecy.”

**Muryan:**
If both possess equal worth, why not determine superiority by use of magecraft?

**Muryan:**
After all, for you two, that is what is truly valuable.

**Muryan:**
Isn't your attitude towards magecraft the one thing you won't lie about?

**Artoria & Fairy Knight Tristan:**
&mdash;

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Fine. So I just have to kill this little shit with magecraft?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
All right, I'm in. You're just going to screw up anyway, aren't you?

**Artoria:**
&mdash;Hmph.

**Artoria:**
If you're the Queen's daughter, then I bet you've been living life cooped up in a grand castle, sheltered away from any slight discomfort!

**Artoria:**
There's no way I'd ever lose to someone like that! Who cares if you're a Fairy Knight!

**Artoria:**
Don't underestimate the guts of a country girl! I ate my vegetables every day for sixteen years!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
That doesn't count, I need a do-over! I wasn't ready yet!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I can do magecraft as much as I want back at the castle! This isn't my true strength!

**Artoria:**
Magecraft is built on steady preparation.

**Artoria:**
Even if you don't have any magic items on hand, there are heaps of things in the venue here that can be used as substitutes.

**Artoria:**
(Like this extremely flammable carpet, or that lamp I could turn into a bomb with magical energy.)

**Artoria:**
And yet, now that you're out of tools, you're too clumsy to do anything about it.

**Artoria:**
Now listen up, you got it?!

**Artoria:**
You're a hundred years too young for magecraft, so go back to school and start from scratch!

**Artoria:**
(Yesss, I did it&ndash;!)

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
You can't talk to me that way, you goddamn brat&mdash;!

**Muryan:**
That's enough. The victor is decided. The one superior in magecraft is Lady Artoria.

**Muryan:**
Therefore, the false Child of Prophecy will be purchased by her.

**Muryan:**
That concludes tonight's auction. Everybody, please be safe on your return trip.

**Muryan:**
It'd be best if you'd return as well, Lady Tristan.

**Muryan:**
If I recall... aren't you in the middle of a period of house arrest in New Darlington?

**Muryan:**
If rumors begin to circulate that you were in Gloucester tonight, would Her Majesty not be displeased with you?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Tch...! So you're taking the Child of Prophecy's side, are you, Muryan!?

**Muryan:**
Not at all. I am merely showing deference to Her Majesty, who bestowed the position of Fairy Knight on you.

**Muryan:**
The venue can always be cleaned, but upholding the Queen's dignity is most important.

**Muryan:**
There are some fairies who grow tired of your selfishness, and may begin to lose their faith in the Queen.

**Muryan:**
You know well how mercurial fairies can be, don't you?

**Muryan:**
From my position, I'd rather Knocknarea not get any more supporters in the north.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
&mdash;. &mdash;fine, I get it. I'm leaving.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
See you soon in Camelot, Muryan?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
As someone with the same taste in art, I'd love to show you my collection.

**???:**
Ah&mdash;hahahaha~ ~!!!

**???:**
I was so nervous...! I thought she would kill us all!

**???:**
That's amazing. It really felt like she would, but then that girl really won against Lady Tristan!

**???:**
We have the same build, and roughly the same amount of magical energy,

**???:**
and yet she's got such an amazing air about her... just wow, so cool!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Phew...guess we made it through somehow.|

**Artoria:**
Aha...hahaha...my legs are starting to shake...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you hear something coming from backstage?

**Artoria:**
Sorry, I'm trembling all over, and there's a ringing in my ears...


---

**Artoria:**
But I couldn't just let it slide. She's a fairy dozens of times stronger than I am, and yet...

**Artoria:**
She acts like that despite having the same name as Tristan, so I just got so angry...

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I didn't expect we'd catch the attention of a second Fairy Knight so quickly.

**Da Vinci:**
But Artoria won the magecraft showdown! Now that that's over with, the only problem left is&mdash;

**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, everything's fine and dandy now that the cage is gone. What kind of trick is that?

**Da Vinci:**
And now Muramasa's out of the cage.

**Da Vinci:**
Artoria, Oberon, I haven't explained this to you yet, but...

**Da Vinci:**
He may be a Heroic Spirit from the “outside world”, but he's not exactly a friend of ours.

**Da Vinci:**
He's an apostle of the Alien God. A Servant of a force hostile to pan-human history.

**Artoria:**
Fujimaru's enemy, huh? But didn't you call him “old man” earlier?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, he is an old man...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's a bit of a long story...


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
Don't bother explaining. We've just had a bit of a connection up 'til now.

**Senji Muramasa:**
We're not out to kill each other...but we ain't exactly friends either.

**Senji Muramasa:**
To put it bluntly, we've got a troubled relationship. Wouldn't you say, Fujimaru?

**Senji Muramasa:**
If you want to fight, I'll fight. If not, then that's that.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I'll even make tea to pass the time. It's just the way things go when you bump into someone.

**Senji Muramasa:**
More importantly, little girl. That staff, and that figure&mdash;

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Senji Muramasa:**
That was quite the show you put on! You even got the last pose right!

**Senji Muramasa:**
A true master of your craft! British magi sure are something!

**Artoria:**
S&mdash;sure. Uh, thanks.

**Artoria:**
(Fujimaru, Fujimaru...!)

**Artoria:**
(What's with this man!?)

**Artoria:**
(He looks so young, but he's an old man on the inside! He has a very bad air to him, but he isn't hostile at all!)

**Da Vinci:**
Alright, hold it right there, Senji Muramasa. The fact remains that you're still a threat to us.

**Da Vinci:**
And on top of that, I just have to know. How in the heck did you get here?

**Senji Muramasa:**
...Well, I'd rather not say.

**Senji Muramasa:**
But, I guess I owe you now. All right, I'll make this brief.

**Senji Muramasa:**
After you all left Olympus, I got orders from the Alien God.

**Senji Muramasa:**
“Go to the British Lostbelt and deal with the Lostbelt King.”

**Senji Muramasa:**
It said that Britain's growth was “outside the plan”.

**Senji Muramasa:**
That bastard Rasputin was occupied elsewhere, and we couldn't get in contact with Limbo.

**Senji Muramasa:**
That being the case, I came here on my own, and broke into the castle at the center of the island.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Took even the Fairy Knights by surprise. I could've easily made it all the way to the throne, but...

**Senji Muramasa:**
Just as I was about to lop off the Queen's head, some crazy thing flew out of the sky.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Next thing I knew, it blew me off the throne.

**Senji Muramasa:**
We crossed swords a bunch of times in the air, but I got dropped down the pit without getting a good hit in.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Took a little less than ten seconds to be dumped down there. How many times was my Spiritual Core hit in that timeframe?

**Senji Muramasa:**
A normal Servant would have died, what, twelve times over?

**Senji Muramasa:**
Too bad I'm a blasphemous creation tempered by the Alien God.

**Senji Muramasa:**
As long as I narrowly escape death, I just have to keep opening my eyes.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Took me about three days to get to the point I could move enough to crawl up and out of the hole.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I'd run out of steam, so I stayed in a village as a master smith for about three days.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Wasted three more days collapsed on the road after I wandered into that weird forest.

**Senji Muramasa:**
And then I got captured by a bunch of rowdy fairies, which wasted three more days.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I've spent the last five days stuck in this crazy town, forced to talk and show off my skills.

**Senji Muramasa:**
And that's all there is to it. It's a pretty pitiful story, but nothing worth writing home about.

**Artoria:**
Isn't the fact that you made it all the way to Morgan's throne amazing enough!?

**Artoria:**
No warrior has ever made it that far in all the Queen's Calendar!

**Senji Muramasa:**
...Is that so?

**Artoria:**
On top of that, you have experience as a blacksmith! The catalogue said you can make anything!

**Senji Muramasa:**
...I guess?

**Artoria:**
But you're an evil Servant...so I guess we have to kill you right now, just to be sure...!

**Senji Muramasa:**
...Hey now.

**Oberon:**
Good Servants, evil Servants... What matters is what you've done up to the present.

**Oberon:**
Servants are like mercenaries, you know. The important thing is who their current contract is with, and what they do from then on.

**Senji Muramasa:**
...who are you? From the looks of it, you're a Servant.

**Oberon:**
I'm Oberon. A pan-human history Servant summoned to Britain one step ahead of you.

**Oberon:**
Senji Muramasa, huh? From the looks of it, you're after Queen Morgan.

**Oberon:**
Then it looks like we all want the same thing. How about that? Yesterday's enemy is today's ally, or so they say.

**Oberon:**
Let's work together until Morgan's defeated. Don't you think it would be better to present a united front?

**Senji Muramasa:**
...I guess so. Not like I can expect any reinforcements here.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Seems like your proposal is a bit of a godsend to me.

**Da Vinci:**
...hmm. What do you think Fujimaru?

**Da Vinci:**
He may be an apostle, but he's a reasonable one.

**Da Vinci:**
This Alter Ego Muramasa isn't the same one that saved our lives in Shimousa, but...

**Da Vinci:**
His nature and disposition should be the same. Once he makes a promise, he won't work against it.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'm hopeful, but...what about you, Artoria?|


---

**Artoria:**
Eh? He's coming with us?

**Artoria:**
Then in that case, welcome aboard! There's no such thing as an evil blacksmith!

**Da Vinci:**
Uuh, leaving Artoria's mysterious opinions about smiths aside,

**Da Vinci:**
are you sure about this, Muramasa? The Alien God is hostile towards us.

**Da Vinci:**
Isn't this a betrayal? Are you gonna blow up out of nowhere?

**Senji Muramasa:**
Of course not. What's going through your head?

**Senji Muramasa:**
This ain't any kind of betrayal.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I'm just a swordsmith contracted to work for the Alien God. There's no loyalty involved.

**Senji Muramasa:**
If you want to talk about moral obligations, then that's firmly on the side of you guys.

**Senji Muramasa:**
You saved me, so I'm returning the favor. The Child of Prophecy, huh? I keep hearing about you.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I'll stick with you guys until the Queen is taken down. That doesn't conflict with my contract with the Alien God.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Muramasa joined the party!|


---

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Ahem. It appears you have much to discuss, so would you mind proceeding?

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Thank you very much for your patronage.

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
In accordance with this, the manager would very much like to meet you all and receive your payment.

**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Please, proceed to the lord's manor. The Lord of Gloucester, Lady Muryan, is waiting for you.

**--ARROW--:**

**Muryan:**
Nice to meet you, Artoria! And everyone from pan-human history, as well!

**Muryan:**
That was quite some battle you had! Thanks to you, the great fashion trend of tomorrow has been decided～☆

**Muryan:**
It goes as follows,

**Muryan:**
“Daily DIY necessities that can be quite convenient! Simple! Worth trying! Magical items that bring you good luck!”

**Muryan:**
Fufufu. This is going to be the most drab fashion trend Gloucester has ever seen!

**Muryan:**
Ah. Did I say something strange?

**Muryan:**
Hmph. Well, it's not impossible that you would be stricken with nerves when I, the charismatic producer of the Fairy Kingdom,

**Muryan:**
would summon you, a bunch of no-name fairies and humans with no money and no power to speak of.

**Muryan:**
So I thought I'd go out and meet you with an uppity attitude and gain some more popularity all at once...

**Muryan:**
I guess you shouldn't do things outside of your comfort zone...still, first impressions are important, so...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're... Muryan?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(...She reminds me of a certain devilish kouhai... BB...)


---

**Muryan:**
Yep. No need for lengthy introductions, right? I'm Muryan. At your service.

**Oberon:**
Sigh...finally, you're back to your normal self. I almost thought you were an impostor there for a second, Muryan.

**Oberon:**
What was that all about? Are you gonna turn yourself into a Mors next?

**Muryan:**
There's no need for such discourtesy, Oberon. I'm an eternally-perfect lady.

**Muryan:**
That was nothing more than a freebie.

**Muryan:**
I'd been looking forward to meeting someone from pan-human history, aside from Beryl Gut.

**Muryan:**
These Fairy Eyes of mine may have declined, but I can still see some “color.”

**Muryan:**
Fujimaru, right? Just as I thought, a fine young {(M) man /(F) woman}!

**Muryan:**
If every human from the outside world was like Beryl, I'd be killing them all in a fit of rage,

**Muryan:**
so I'm glad there's a decent look about you. It gives me a little bit of hope.

**Da Vinci:**
You're most kind. I'm still a little bit baffled by this hospitality, though.

**Da Vinci:**
Despite knowing all about pan-human history, you're welcoming us with open arms... is that right?

**Muryan:**
Don't get the wrong idea, pan-human history isn't my enemy!

**Muryan:**
...

**Muryan:**
Excuse me, that was a mistake. I don't have any enmity towards pan-human history, rather.

**Muryan:**
The one who I am on guard against is you, the organization called Chaldea.

**Muryan:**
I heard that you have crossed many other worlds before now.

**Muryan:**
I will need to determine your intentions in this Fairy Kingdom.

**Muryan:**
...well, I heard the gist of it from Muramasa, so my assessment is as good as done.

**Da Vinci:**
Muramasa? Did you tell her about us?

**Senji Muramasa:**
Now now, I never dreamed I'd end up working with you lot.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I couldn't stand Muryan's interrogation, so I let slip a few things about Olympus.

**Muryan:**
It wasn't an interrogation, more like a...fun tea party.

**Muryan:**
Still...the Alien God...Fantasy Trees...Crypters and Alter Egos...

**Muryan:**
I heard so many very, very interesting things, that I may have gone a little overboard with excitement.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Just a little?

**Senji Muramasa:**
From what I heard, the Wing Clan are the most gentle of the fairies. Was that complete bunk?

**Oberon:**
Yeah, it's true that they were.

**Oberon:**
The mild-mannered Wing Clan is no more. Because...

**Muryan:**
Oberon.

**Oberon:**
Whoops, my bad. I'll shut up now. Please continue, o korpokkur princess.

**Muryan:**
It was Muramasa who was out of line. It was not your error, Oberon.

**Muryan:**
...Fujimaru. There is one thing I wish to confirm.

**Muryan:**
You have no intention of turning against this Lostbelt, correct?

**Muryan:**
Your business is only with Her Highness Morgan, who made the foolish decision to attack Olympus.

**Muryan:**
Can you assure me, that Chaldea has no mind to turn on Britain itself?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can't confirm that yet.


---

**Muryan:**
...I see. You won't say, but you remain prudent.

**Muryan:**
Who is your enemy and what do they want? That is what you're still trying to figure out.

**Muryan:**
You've yet to even meet Her Majesty. You can't give an answer so easily.

**Muryan:**
Very well.

**Muryan:**
Normally, I would capture you all and present you to Her Majesty, but...

**Muryan:**
Just as you have reserved judgement, I shall do the same.

**Muryan:**
As long as Chaldea does not attack Britain, I shall not raise a hand against you.

**Muryan:**
Please enjoy your stay in Britain. And&mdash;

**Muryan:**
Lady Artoria. Have you memorized the prophecy Ainsel left behind?

**Artoria:**
Y-yes, a bit.

**Artoria:**
“From now, I will tell you of a future. The future of the mystical island which became the land of fairies.”

**Artoria:**
“The innocent shall return. To the Queen's castle, bottomless as it is.”

**Artoria:**
“Yet we must only endure a short time more. The morning when two thousand years have passed, the child of salvation will appear.”

**Artoria:**
“They who unites fairies and humans, us and them. The child of salvation who will save the world.”

**Artoria:**
“A city of iron, a sea of soot. When the calamity has been repelled, the pilgrimage will be hailed.”

**Artoria:**
“Ring out, ring out; like thunderous fury, like fiery lamentation. Let the six bells toll in demonstration. Make way for the true king.”

**Artoria:**
I think that's how it went?

**Muryan:**
...you cut out the majority, but that's the gist of it.

**Muryan:**
Oberon. Is she really the Child of Prophecy?

**Muryan:**
You can't even weaponize your best selling point, can you?

**Oberon:**
Don't be like that. She covered the important parts.

**Oberon:**
Even for you, only the last verse should matter. You're the guardian of the bell tower up here.

**Artoria:**
I don't know if I would call this a bell tower.

**Muryan:**
He's right. Of the six bells in the prophecy.

**Muryan:**
One of them is up here. What about the one in Salisbury?

**Muryan:**
Wait a minute. Did you not come here to ring Gloucester's bell?

**Artoria:**
That's...uh, how do I put this...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're looking for someone here.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you know a human girl named Mash?


---

**Muryan:**
Mash...you say?

**Muryan:**
My apologies, but such a word has never been uttered in Gloucester.

**Muryan:**
Could they be in another city?

**Senji Muramasa:**
I see. The little girl isn't here, I thought something was amiss.

**Senji Muramasa:**
What, did she get lost? And you came to Gloucester to look for her?

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, because they said they were auctioning off a “fairy with iron weapons”!

**Da Vinci:**
But it was the wrong guy!

**Oberon:**
Yeah, I'll take some of the blame for that one. I should have done a little more research.

**Oberon:**
If I could have snuck into the auction room, I would have at least known if it was a man or a woman.

**Muryan:**
Hehehe, that's impossible.

**Muryan:**
My auctions are strictly confidential and absolutely secure. Nothing gets in, not even a single ant or a drop of blood.

**Oberon:**
Seems that way. “Violence is not allowed in Gloucester.”

**Oberon:**
That's the faith you've been protecting for the last several hundred years, right Muryan? Or is it your purpose?

**Oberon:**
But let's get back to the bells, Muryan.

**Oberon:**
For someone who believes Artoria is the Child of Prophecy, aren't you being a little cold towards her?

**Muryan:**
...to be honest, I'm despondent.

**Muryan:**
Her Majesty is undoubtedly a magnificent sovereign. But she is far too ruthless.

**Muryan:**
It's not just her existence tax. The treatment of humans. The persecution of non-clan fairies.

**Muryan:**
How she's handling the Calamity. Her monopoly on the flotsam. Her awful law on the cessation of imitating human civilization.

**Muryan:**
The declaration of Darlington's relocation and the subsequent construction of the National Theater of Slaughter in the last hundred years.

**Muryan:**
She's always been merciless against those who oppose her, but appointing Tristan as her successor was simply going too far.

**Muryan:**
...Yes. For a time I'd hoped she would be a queen who would protect Britain from the Calamities, but...

**Muryan:**
Now, she's nothing more than a witch who runs Britain as she sees fit.

**Muryan:**
I...we have been waiting for you, Lady Artoria. However&mdash;

**Muryan:**
As you are now, you do not inspire much confidence. I cannot imagine someone like you overthrowing the Queen.

**Muryan:**
If the other clans were to take sides, I would consider it, but neither the Earth Clan nor the Wind Clan will make a move.

**Oberon:**
So, you're not going to show us to Gloucester's bell?

**Muryan:**
Not at present.

**Muryan:**
I am the Lord of Gloucester. Until the end of time, I have reason to protect this city.

**Muryan:**
Backing Lady Artoria at this juncture would only be seen as treason against the Queen.

**Muryan:**
My Fairy Territory would easily be cancelled out and fall under Queen Morgan's power.

**Muryan:**
So, that's why...

**Muryan:**
Please, return to Gloucester after you have gotten stronger.

**Muryan:**
It can be any kind of strength. Connections, magic, money...

**Muryan:**
Whatever it takes to defeat Her Majesty.

**Muryan:**
Don't forget, Artoria. You're the shining star of hope for the fairies.

**Muryan:**
You're the chosen Child of Prophecy, the one to bring Britain out of its long twilight.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...the star of hope, for the fairies...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...get stronger, and come back...


---

**Muryan:**
Yes. For that reason, please do everything in your power to help Lady Artoria, Fujimaru.

**Muryan:**
You're good at dealing with the bad guys, right? I've heard you have quite a bit of experience...

**Da Vinci:**
Muryan. I understand you are not our enemy.

**Da Vinci:**
But where are you getting all this information? Even if Muramasa told you stories, we're still strangers to you.

**Da Vinci:**
In terms of danger, we're probably about the same level of “nuisance” to you as Queen Morgan is.

**Da Vinci:**
And despite that, you trust Chaldea... or rather, you trust Fujimaru.

**Da Vinci:**
Something isn't adding up here. Is there something you're hiding?

**Muryan:**
Ah, I see how it is&mdash;

**Muryan:**
Of course. Just as well then, I'll introduce you.

**Muryan:**
Another visitor from the “outside” who has told me stories of you and Chaldea.

**Muryan:**
Please, come and join us, Lady F. Umm, your real name was&mdash;

**???:**
Koyanskaya. Tamamovitch Koyanskaya, Princess.

**Koyanskaya:**
Good day to you, Chaldea. I'm glad to see you are doing well.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Koyanskaya&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Another new outfit!


---

**Muryan:**
You musn't. Please calm down, Fujimaru.

**Muryan:**
I told you, I won't tolerate violence in my Gloucester.

**Muryan:**
And, she's an important client of mine. Actually, you could call her a business partner.

**Muryan:**
She bears no enmity towards Britain, nor any desire to fight Chaldea.

**Muryan:**
As a matter of fact, she isn't supposed to be in Britain at all right now.

**Muryan:**
I've convinced her to stay here for my own selfish reasons.

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm, what do you mean, “selfish”?

**Muryan:**
As my personal bodyguard, of course!

**Muryan:**
Her one fault is her tremendous thirst for money, but her fighting prowess more than makes up for that!

**Muryan:**
And best of all, she can fight against the Mors! No longer do I have to bow down to the Fang Clan or the Fairy Knights!

**Senji Muramasa:**
...I see.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I heard that once she transported Beryl out of Olympus, they lost contact...

**Senji Muramasa:**
Are you scrounging for something here in Britain as well? What are you up to, Koyanskaya?

**Senji Muramasa:**
You were aiming for Chaldea and the Alien God to wipe each other out, but you were found out by the Alien God.

**Senji Muramasa:**
You've persevered up until this point, and now you're ready to show your true colours?

**Koyanskaya:**
No no no, not at all. The Alien God and I have an equal partnership.

**Koyanskaya:**
“Until such a time as we have achieved our goals, there will be no interference between us.” That's the contract between me and that strange god.

**Koyanskaya:**
My outset has been completely different from that of you three Alter-Egos from the very start.

**Koyanskaya:**
Lords Muramasa, Rasputin, and Limbo are Servants summoned by the Alien God,

**Koyanskaya:**
But I am a Servant who has manifested by my own power. Therefore, I'm free to do as I please.

**Koyanskaya:**
This time, Lady Muryan's proposal was too attractive, so I'm staying here for now.

**Koyanskaya:**
It was brash of you to make an unnecessary detour to Britain. Regardless,

**Koyanskaya:**
I have no interest in the Queen's endeavours, the humans of this Fairy Kingdom, or in any of you.

**Koyanskaya:**
I hope I make myself perfectly clear! ♡

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...you don't have any schemes planned, then?|

**Koyanskaya:**
My, of course not. You see&mdash;

**Koyanskaya:**
I don't need to interfere with this world, because it's already a complete disaster.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...so what on earth are you doing here, then?

**Koyanskaya:**
Why, replenishing my stock, of course♡

**Koyanskaya:**
I have obtained many a rare item unique to this fairyland.

**Koyanskaya:**
Up to now the Lostbelts have been limited, crude, cluttered, science-fiction-y...

**Koyanskaya:**
Honestly they've all been somewhat lacking, but this one is absolutely perfect! No complaints!

**Koyanskaya:**
Strange, beautiful, and so wonderfully gruesome.

**Koyanskaya:**
Such wonderful designs, despite being a threat to all of humanity.


---

**Muryan:**
Koyanskaya. Please stop provoking confrontation when we are about to reach a settlement.

**Muryan:**
You are beautiful in both body and soul, so why do you debase yourself?

**Muryan:**
We're going to cooperate with them anyway, so can you not be cordial?

**Koyanskaya:**
Oops, there goes my mouth again. If that is what the client desires, so be it.

**Koyanskaya:**
That's how it is, {(M) Mr. /(F) Ms.} Fujimaru, and da Vinci.

**Koyanskaya:**
We've been through a lot, but here in Britain, we will be fellow members of pan-human history.

**Koyanskaya:**
I think it's best to let bygones be bygones, and devote ourselves to our mutual goals.

**Koyanskaya:**
At least, until you meet up with Mash. Isn't that right, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|


---

**Da Vinci:**
...you're right. The situation is what it is. We can't afford to deal with you on top of everything else.

**Da Vinci:**
If you stay out of our way, we won't mess with you.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I ought to slay her here and now. Well, can't shed any blood in front of Muryan.

**Artoria:**
Um, ummm... I don't know this person very well, so...

**Artoria:**
I don't know what to say... I-I'll leave it to you guys to decide!

**Koyanskaya:**
A wise decision, ladies and gentlemen. I was in the mood for some casual sightseeing myself, as well.

**Oberon:**
You disgust me.

**Koyanskaya:**
&mdash;Oberon, was it? What was that?

**Oberon:**
Shut it. Don't talk to me, your drivel rots my ears.

**Oberon:**
As your friend, I must warn you, Muryan. This creature is utterly despicable.

**Oberon:**
No matter the trust extended to this vixen, it will fall short. I suggest you cut ties with her while you still can.

**Muryan:**
And we close in the worst possible fashion.

**Muryan:**
You must have ruffled their feathers rather badly, Koyanskaya.

**Koyanskaya:**
Yes, indeed.

**Koyanskaya:**
Master Gordolf's mercenary forces were all but annihilated. Chaldea's main base was overrun, and all the staff's lives were...put on ice, shall we say?

**Koyanskaya:**
No wonder {(M) he /(F) she} despises my guts enough to want me dead. It's not surprising...

**Koyanskaya:**
Who's that Oberon Servant? He doesn't seem to be from the Fairy Kingdom, but...

**Muryan:**
Oberon is a fairy who materialised in the Welsh forest about two months ago.

**Muryan:**
Ah, “Servant”, they call him. A heroic spirit from the past of pan-human history.

**Muryan:**
He's been visiting cities all across Britain, proclaiming himself to be the “Fairy King.”

**Muryan:**
He eventually ended up in Gloucester, and that's when we first met.

**Muryan:**
...at first I was overjoyed to meet him, because he looked so much like one of my fellow clansmen, but...

**Oberon:**
...sorry. There's no obligation for me to tell you, but since not saying it would be dishonest, I'll just put it out there.

**Oberon:**
I'm not part of the Wing Clan. I just look a bit like them. After all, your fellow members are already&mdash;

**Oberon:**
Hmm, never mind that, you're the head of Gloucester, aren't you?

**Oberon:**
I need an unsecured loan! The world is at stake here, you know!

**Muryan:**
Well, as you could no doubt see, he's a jolly fellow. He's not a fairy king, maybe a clown king would be more fitting...

**Muryan:**
He told me in advance that the “Child of Prophecy” would be paying a visit today.

**Koyanskaya:**
Is that so...

**Koyanskaya:**
(Call it keen intuition, but I have a feeling squashing that horrisonant fly ahead of time might save us a LOT of trouble...)

**Muryan:**
Oh, right. It looks like I can get you some of that “past history” that you've been so eager to learn about.

**Muryan:**
Over 2,000 years of history... and very few people can speak of the “Fairy Calendar” any more.

**Muryan:**
I bought up the treasured collection of a former librarian who was exiled from Camelot.

**Muryan:**
It'll be arriving shortly.

**Muryan:**
But I'm surprised. I can't believe you want to know about our history...

**Muryan:**
It's completely different from pan-human history, so how would it be of assistance to you?

**Koyanskaya:**
That's exactly why.

**Koyanskaya:**
My goal is to find a Magical Beast that doesn't exist in the history of mankind.

**Koyanskaya:**
It doesn't matter what sort of creature it is. As long as it has “bodily hair”, it can be copied...

**Koyanskaya:**
I'm able to take it in as information and make it a part of me.

**Koyanskaya:**
Nonetheless, I can only take up to nine big ones. I came to Britain to secure my sixth tail...

**Koyanskaya:**
But now, I'm much more interested in the origins of the Fairy Kingdom itself.

**Koyanskaya:**
But, I must apologise, Lady Muryan... You've spent so much more than was necessary on my account...

**Muryan:**
Don't worry. I too was a scholar, before I became lord of Gloucester.

**Muryan:**
I used to disobey my father and stay in the library until late, immersing myself in the legend of Tonelico...

**Muryan:**
A true bookworm, I was... until the Queen allowed such brutality to take place.

**Koyanskaya:**
...Then.

**Koyanskaya:**
You're going to wait for the Child of Prophecy to grow strong, and rebel against the Queen, aren't you, Lady Muryan?

**Muryan:**
... ...No. Not at all!

**Muryan:**
The hope of all fairies? The saviour of Britain?

**Muryan:**
The Child of Prophecy who will end the tyrannical rule of Her Majesty Morgan...

**Muryan:**
I wasn't expecting it to ever happen... but there was never a time when I wasn't thinking about it.

**Muryan:**
And the fact it was such a lowly fairy was quite a surprise!

**Muryan:**
Her magical energy is average, her beauty is average. Her size is average. She doesn't even have her own Fairy Territory!

**Muryan:**
Who is going to be saved by a fairy like that? The only thing you should trust in is your own power, after all.

**Muryan:**
Senji Muramasa. It's a shame you didn't become mine after spending so much time here, but...

**Muryan:**
With your help, there wouldn't be any need for a “Child of Prophecy”.

**Muryan:**
I can make good use of both Chaldea, and the “Child of Prophecy”.

**Muryan:**
If that filthy human Master defeats just one Fairy Knight, it's all over.

**Muryan:**
If one of the Fairy Knights falls, there'll be no stopping Knocknarea in the north.

**Muryan:**
Her Majesty Morgan, and Knocknarea. The Child of Prophecy, and Fujimaru.

**Muryan:**
To the brave who survive, I hereby invite you to my “gameboard”&mdash;

**--ARROW--:**

**Da Vinci:**
Aww. We finally had the chance to talk to a clan head, then Oberon screwed it all up.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Telling us to "please go home" in the worst possible manner...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
"Ochazuke is delicious, hooray!"


---

**Oberon:**
That was my fault, I'll own it. I was immature.

**Oberon:**
But I'm not apologizing. I said what I had to say.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Mm. I like you, Oberon.

**Senji Muramasa:**
It takes a lot of courage to say something like that in front of that vixen.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Or maybe it was all an act? Either way, you're a top-class orator.

**Senji Muramasa:**
You must come from a pretty good-natured legend. Tell me about it sometime.

**Artoria:**
...but is this really alright? Putting aside the Child of Prophecy...

**Artoria:**
Muryan seemed like she wanted to cooperate with Chaldea...with Fujimaru...

**Da Vinci:**
Oh, don't worry about that.

**Da Vinci:**
Muryan was in no mood to help us in any case.

**Artoria:**
Is that so?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why?|

**Da Vinci:**
Muryan wanted military strength that was not of the Queen or Child of Prophecy, but only of Gloucester.

**Da Vinci:**
I guess she had her eye on Chaldea at first. But now, she's gotten her hands on&mdash;


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see, because Koyanskaya's already here...

**Oberon:**
Yeah. Muryan's got her hands on a trump card that she can use at her leisure.

**Oberon:**
That's why she doesn't have to ally with us anymore, and she doesn't need to waste time endorsing the Child of Prophecy.


---

**Artoria:**
I-I see...there's no use for me here either&mdash;

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
Ah, there you are! Hey, wait up&ndash;!

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
Child of Prophecy! Everyone, you're friends with the Child of Prophecy, right!?

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairy:**
Where did she go? Did she leave already? Maybe already to the next city?

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairy:**
Well of course! If she stays in one place too long, Woodwose's soldiers will track her down!

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairy:**
Aah, I just wanted a single glance...but it can't be helped. It's the Child of Prophecy after all!

**Artoria:**
A-ah, everybody, um&mdash;

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
But it's all right, you guys can take it. Here, it's not much, but I want you to have this.

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
One day the Child of Prophecy will appear. I've been saving up, believing in that.

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
It's nothing but a bunch of cheap stuff like small change, secondhand clothes, stones, and tree roots, but...

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
It's all we can do right now. I think it'll definitely be useful for something.

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
So please, take it. I'm begging you.

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Artoria:**
Yes. I'll gladly keep it safe. The Child of Prophecy will definitely be overjoyed to hear that.

**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
I see...yeah, of course! Everyone, be sure to keep the Child safe!

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Oberon:**
Wow. That's a mountain of gifts. Can you carry it in your arms, da Vinci?

**Da Vinci:**
Of course. Getting them out of the city will be no problem. I'll hold on to them until we get to the carriage.

**Da Vinci:**
This is great, Artoria. They didn't recognize you as the real thing, but...

**Da Vinci:**
Even here in Gloucester, the Child of Prophecy has become everybody's hope.

**Artoria:**
Yes. With this we won't have to worry about components for magecraft or food for Fujimaru!

**Senji Muramasa:**
...

**Oberon:**
All right then. After going through so much trouble to get here, I'd at least like to spend the night in Gloucester, but...

**Oberon:**
If even the common folk know about that dustup in the auction house,

**Oberon:**
the Queen's men will already know we're here. We shouldn't linger.

**Artoria:**
T-that's true. But Mash's trail...

**Oberon:**
...if Muryan hasn't heard anything, then there's nothing to be learned in Gloucester.

**Oberon:**
With no sightings in either Salisbury or Gloucester, we're out of luck.

**Oberon:**
We're still being hunted for that one incident at the farm. It's likely we'll be caught by the Queen's soldiers if we move recklessly.

**Oberon:**
I think we should temporarily call off the search on foot at this point, but what do you think?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...sorry. Would it be suicide to head to another city?|


---

**Oberon:**
Yeah. It's dangerous to go back to Salisbury at this point.

**Oberon:**
Therefore, how about we continue our search for Mash via other means?

**Oberon:**
I'll have you guys go into hiding, and in the meantime I'll send spies out to gather information on Mash.

**Oberon:**
I said “the search on foot,” didn't I?

**Oberon:**
In three days we'll have all of Britain's latest news. We can go back to what we've been doing after that.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you, Oberon...!|

**Oberon:**
No, it's nothing worth thanking me for. The truth is, it's just a half-hearted plan of action.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But where are we going to hide...?

**Oberon:**
Of course, I've already thought of that. I came up with this plan because the geographic conditions are good, you could say.


---

**Artoria:**
So we'll be camping outdoors for a bit. Let's look for a place where we won't be seen.

**Artoria:**
Hehehe, leave the tent to me! I know all sorts of Bounded Fields for warding off evil spirits!

**Oberon:**
Really? That's reassuring, but we won't need them this time.

**Artoria:**
Huh?

**Oberon:**
Ah, I see...sorry to take away your moment in the spotlight, Artoria.

**Oberon:**
But I want to go somewhere I can trust for now, so be patient.

**Oberon:**
With that said&mdash;we finally get to use my secret base!

**Oberon:**
You see that forest over the hills to the west? That's the forest of Wales.

**Oberon:**
It's a place of relaxation for “withering things,”  fairies and humans that have been abandoned.

**Oberon:**
It's the domain of the Fairy King, good ol' me.

## Section 5: Fragment / 3 - Sheffield (I) 

**Wag:**
Look Annis, you can see it! That's the cornerstone of the north, the city of Sheffield!

**Annis:**
It's a very imposing citadel! Is that castle on a hill!?

**Rob:**
Yeah, and the only places with walls like that are Camelot and here.

**Rob:**
Did you know? The castle walls of the Fairy Kingdom are special.

**Rob:**
Wall-building fae spent a long time building them, and they act as Bounded Fields.

**Rob:**
Essentially, you can only enter or exit through the “gate”.

**Rob:**
If the gate is open, you can easily pass through. If the gate is closed, it prohibits passage.

**Rob:**
It's a magical wall built with those “rules”.

**Rob:**
With exceptions of water circulation and windows, as long as the gates are guarded, they are well protected.

**Rob:**
I heard that Boggart oversaw the construction of everything, including the castle.

**Annis:**
Boggart? Is he the Lord of Sheffield?

**Rob:**
You got it! Boggart, the embodiment of big talk, Boggart the loveless!

**Rob:**
A thug who not only lost the battle for the head of the Fangs, but also got himself kicked out of Norwich!

**Annis:**
He competed for the position of head of the Fang Clan...he must be a very imposing person.

**Annis:**
I kind of get why you call him a big talker, but... what do you mean by “loveless?”

**Winky:**
He means that literally, Annis. Boggart's arranged himself marriages with human women.

**Winky:**
Every fairy he's had as a wife up until now has hated him.

**Winky:**
Battles of manners with Woodwose. Money games with Spriggan.

**Winky:**
His wives betrayed him at the last second in both of those, so he cast them out.

**Winky:**
Ever since then, Boggart has had a human mistress by his side.

**Winky:**
He thinks that if they're slaves, they won't betray him. That's why he's called “Boggart the loveless.”

**Winky:**
Well, if you ask me, he just doesn't believe in love anymore.

**Annis:**
That's...he must be so miserable.

**Annis:**
But, he still built such an amazing fortress. He seems like such an honorable man!

**Rob:**
You really get into buildings, or rather, castle walls, Annis. I wonder if you were somehow involved with castles after all...

**Rob:**
You remember anything about that? It would be great if you could at least remember where you were born.

**Annis:**
No, everything from before you saved me is still... just, how do I put this...

**Annis:**
I get the feeling...I came here with a very important purpose...

**Wag:**
Of course you did! You are the “Child of Prophecy!”

**Wag:**
A Fairy Knight here to protect us! The savior of Britain!

**Annis:**
...Yes. I'd be glad if that was the case.

**Annis:**
I've seen many different places in Britain up to now.

**Annis:**
I've been here less than ten days...but I think it's a very, very beautiful country.

**Annis:**
If I really do hold the power to protect this country, I couldn't be any happier.

**Winky:**
...Hey Wag, Rob, we're almost at the checkpoint.

**Winky:**
It's now or never. Call an intermediary and let's get this over with.

**Rob:**
R-right. This isn't a good time to be in Sheffield.

**Rob:**
But, what the hell? We've come this far, so what's the harm in sticking together a little while longer?

**Wag:**
Hm? We're introducing Annis to Boggart, aren't we? Then we have to head to the castle.

**Winky:**
...Haa, all right, whatever you want.

**Winky:**
This is too heavy a load for stingy peddlers and wannabe bandits.

**Annis:**
...?

**White Wolf:**
...

**Narration:**
And so, the wagon reached Sheffield.

**Narration:**
It was about the same time as when Fujimaru was still asleep in the Nameless Forest.

**Narration:**
About the same time as when da Vinci had reached Salisbury, and first met Mike at the tavern.

**Narration:**
In the turbulent city of Sheffield, where the flag of rebellion was raised against Queen Morgan,

**Narration:**
the “other Child of Prophecy” entered the stage.

**Boggart:**
<span style=font-size:25px>The Child of Prophecy?</span><span style=font-size:25px>That little girl? </span>

**Rob & Wag:**
Y-yes! There's no mistaking it, Master Boggart!

**Rob & Wag:**
Iron shield and armor, and a dangerous-looking iron cylinder! And on top of that, she's got monstrous strength, strong enough to crush rocks!

**Rob & Wag:**
Please forgive the lack of information about her hometown, for that is a maiden's secret!

**Rob & Wag:**
This is Annis, the Child of Prophecy, destined to save Britain!

**Rob & Wag:**
Please, give her the highest appraisal and treatment she deserves!

**Boggart:**
&mdash;Idiots. This girl is no fairy.

**Boggart:**
Don't think you can fool my nose. She's a human.

**Rob & Wag:**
&mdash;Huh? Annis is a human...? Don't mess with us like that!

**Rob & Wag:**
Her body and magical energy are on par with a fairy's! To begin with, there's no way a human could possess that kind of strength!

**Boggart:**
Humans can be mighty warriors too, although it is rare.

**Boggart:**
This girl...she does indeed have the scent of a fairy, but she also smells very slightly of a human.

**Boggart:**
Coming here, to sell me such a product. You've underestimated me.

**Boggart:**
In my Sheffield, liars are criminals and fraud is a capital offense.

**Boggart:**
Guards. Seize them. Imprison the girl. Hang the merchants.

**Human Guard:**
Sir! 

**Rob & Wag:**
Aaaaaah! S-save us, Annis!

**The Human Guards:**
Uaaaaah&mdash;!?

**Annis:**
I'm sorry, but please stand back! What's more, Rob and the others are not liars!

**Annis:**
I don't have my memories, so I don't know if I'm really the Child of Prophecy myself, but&mdash;

**Annis:**
If the two of them believe in me, then I'm the “Child of Prophecy” for them both!

**Annis:**
If you think they're bad, then please treat me the same way!

**Rob & Wag:**
Annis&mdash;

**Human Guard:**
Tch, this girl is absurd...! Call in the Fang soldiers!

**Human Guard:**
We can't handle her on our own. Protect Lord Boggart!

**Boggart:**
&mdash;Wait. Don't waste your energy. She's not hostile.

**Boggart:**
...So it wasn't a trick after all. Very well, I'll hear you out.

**Boggart:**
Give the merchants their payment. What is your name, brave girl?

**Annis:**
Ah, yes...they gave me the wonderful name of Annis.

**Boggart:**
...Good grief. You don't eat children, do you?

**Boggart:**
Forget the name “Annis”. Hey, are there any guards that can still move?

**Human Guard:**
Y-yes. I can somewhat...everyone else is still numb from that impact...

**Boggart:**
Take her to Habetrot's atelier. As soon as the preparations are made, show her to the princess' chambers.

**Boggart:**
While I am not impressed with her slender build, the way she demonstrated her strength was to my liking. I have yet to savor the sight of such a woman.

**Boggart:**
Rejoice, young lady. For you will be my partner this evening.

**Boggart:**
Bathe yourself and wait for nightfall, my 62nd “bride”.

**Rob & Wag:**
Briiiiide!? Annis is getting married!?

**Annis:**
Huh?

**Narration:**
And so she arrived.

**Narration:**
To the fairy destined to protect her until the very end. At the atelier of the jolly and ever-popular Habetrot.

**Human Guard:**
Habenyan. Habenyan...you've got a new job, Habenyan...

**Human Guard:**
I know you've got a mountain of stuff to do already, but please hear me out without losing your temper, Habenyan...

**Habetrot:**
Quit talking to me like I'm your cat&ndash;! I told you to stop bringing me more work&ndash;!

**Habetrot:**
I came here because you said I would be sewing dresses, but every day it's nothing but armor, spears, and bags!

**Habetrot:**
Who do you think I am!? I'm the finest dressmaker in Britain, the great Habetrot!

**Annis:**
&mdash;S-sorry.

**Annis:**
Boggart told me to get changed in here, so...

**Habetrot:**
&mdash;

**Habetrot:**
...did it......did it...

**Human Guard:**
Habenyan? Have you finally broken down? Well, you've always been a little bit funny in the head, but...

**Habetrot:**
I did it, I finally got a decent job&ndash;! Oh, but this was worth the wait&ndash;!

**Habetrot:**
No problem. She needs a dress, right? I'll get it done in a jiffy!

**Habetrot:**
You're adorable, after all! It's decided, I'll make you my bride too!

**Annis:**
Bride...in addition to being Boggart's bride, will I now also be this fairy's bride?

**Human Guard:**
Oh, pay no attention to her. She's just that kind of fairy.

**Human Guard:**
A while back we put out a call for “fairies who can make wedding dresses”, and she just showed up suddenly.

**Human Guard:**
She's good at what she does, but the way she acts is a little strange... Old-fashioned, or maybe it's better to say she goes at her own pace...

**Human Guard:**
I don't even know whether she understands that we're rebelling against Morgan or not.

**Human Guard:**
But her skills are the real deal. According to her, she's “a bride's best friend.”

**Habetrot:**
That's right. I'm the yarn spinner, Habetrot. A professional seamstress.

**Habetrot:**
I'm a fairy who secretly helps brides who're all in a tissy before they get married.

**Habetrot:**
Well, that's beside the point&mdash;

**Habetrot:**
I've been ready to go for a long time. Let's get your measurements done right away.

**Habetrot:**
Guard, out, out! Leave me alone with her!

**Habetrot:**
And tell Boggart he has to wait a day! He thinks everything can be done in a rush!

**Human Guard:**
S-sure. You want me to bring you some milk later?

**Habetrot:**
As reward for my work, of course! Heat some up and bring it back!

**Habetrot:**
Hello, young lady. It's all right, there's no need to be scared.

**Habetrot:**
All these sudden developments, and you don't know what to make of it all, is that right?

**Habetrot:**
But I'm your new best friend. After all, I'm the sworn ally of all future brides, Habetrot!

**Habetrot:**
Enough of that iron armor. Let me prepare a special dress for you.

**Annis:**
H-hello, nice to meet you, Habenyan. I'm Annis... no, I mean...

**Annis:**
Boggart told me not to use that name.

**Annis:**
Annis...could it be an important name to Boggart?

**Habetrot:**
Oh, Annis. That's definitely not good.

**Habetrot:**
A long time ago, there was a scary fairy called Black Annis. She kidnapped children and ate them.

**Habetrot:**
You're nothing like her. Let's see...excuse me for a second.

**Habetrot:**
Ah, I thought so. I'll call you Mash. Is that alright?

**A：Mash:**
Yes. It's hard to throw away the name Annis, but I'm not uncomfortable with the sound of that one either.

**A：Mash:**
But why Mash, exactly?

**Habetrot:**
It's written on your shield, see? Look, on the back. It says “Mash” in chalk.

**A：Mash:**
Ah! Oh, it does! So big too, I hadn't even noticed it!

**Habetrot:**
You've got a few screws loose for someone who writes their name on all their belongings!

**Narration:**
Thus, she rediscovered her true name. But, it was still a mere formality.

**Narration:**
There would be some time yet until she was truly “Mash” once again.

**Habetrot:**
All right, done with the measurements, let's get to wor~k! Oh, do you have a favorite color?

**Habetrot:**
Your armor was black, but I think you'd look great in white!

**Narration:**
Habetrot was in a good mood as she skillfully cut the fabric with scissors.

**Narration:**
&mdash;And so, the next day.

**Narration:**
Habetrot's greatest, most joyous occasion came to an end.

**Habetrot:**
All right, I've finished with the adjustments. You can open your eyes, Mash. Take a look at yourself in the mirror.

**Mash:**
&mdash;

**Mash:**
Oh my goodness...! Such a wonderful dress, Habenyan!

**Mash:**
It's easy to move around in, warm, and best of all, it's very soft on the skin.

**Mash:**
It's like I'm covered in stars...

**Mash:**
I'm such a lucky bride, for you to have done this for me so soon after I arrived!

**Habetrot:**
Yeah. Good morning, Mash.

**Habetrot:**
It's a relief. I'm so glad you like it.

**Narration:**
And now, the true story begins.

**Narration:**
No longer the Knight of the Shield, but a princess envied by all.

**Narration:**
A time of peace, unlike any other in the Fairy Kingdom. The truly shining days had begun.

**Narration:**
For you see, it would only be a short while before the fortress of Sheffield would crumble in flames.

**--ARROW--:**

**Narration:**
In the early morning, the castle town was bustling, as if celebrating a festival.

**Narration:**
Rumors of the princess spread like wildfire. A knight adorned in iron armor, who could hold their own against Mors and Black Dog alike,

**Narration:**
a princess stronger than Boggart himself—more on that later.

**Fairy Soldiers:**
Did you hear about the new princess!? The one who blew away Lord Boggart!

**Fairy Soldiers:**
Lord Boggart can withstand a blow to the face from Gawain, so that's a considerable feat!

**Townspeople:**
The merchants who brought her here say she's the Child of Prophecy.

**Townspeople:**
If she's the real deal...maybe, just maybe, we can return to Norwich!

**Human Soldiers:**
Yeah, I caught a glimpse of her at the castle yesterday. That is the real Child of Prophecy.

**Human Soldiers:**
The very air around her is different! She's no ordinary fairy!

**Human Soldiers:**
Best of all was the lovely smile on her face when she looked my way! She's a match even for Lancelot!

**Rob:**
Heh, you hear that Wag, Winky?

**Rob:**
The whole town is talking about Annis...I mean, Mash!

**Rob:**
That Boggart guy paid us a lot of money for her! Now we'll have nothing to worry about this winter!

**Wag:**
But we haven't been able to see Mash since... never thought she'd be living in the castle...

**Wag:**
I thought she'd stay with us forever...

**Rob:**
D-dumbass, have a little patience! Boggart will be bored of her soon enough.

**Rob:**
Then we'll just pick up Mash, and head to Edinburgh next!

**Rob:**
Knocknarea in the North will pay an even higher price for the Child of Prophecy!

**Winky:**
Hey now. Aside from how much of an idiot Wag is, what are you thinking about, Rob?

**Winky:**
Mash is just a commodity. Once she's sold, that's it. She has nothing to do with us anymore.

**Winky:**
It's about time we departed Sheffield. If we stay too long, we'll never be able to leave.

**Wag:**
What are you saying, Winky? We can't just run away. We've got money, so why don't we just stay here until the spring?

**Rob:**
Right, Mash protected us! She protected outcasts like me and Wag!

**Rob:**
We're staying here until we can return that favor. If you want to leave, you're on your own, Winky.

**Rob:**
Unlike us, you've got a good head about you, and you're from this Kingdom to begin with.

**Rob:**
You're not like us outcasts who drifted here. You could make it anywhere!

**Winky:**
...that's a bit of a stretch.

**Winky:**
The cleverer you are, the more cynical you'll end up, and the less you can overturn your beliefs.

**Boggart:**
For the record, I don't recognize you as the Child of Prophecy.

**Boggart:**
I let the townspeople say what they like because it is a convenience for them.

**Boggart:**
Do you understand? Don't think you have any right to speak of this.

**Boggart:**
Strength alone is not enough to stand against Morgan. The dignity and grace of a king are required.

**Boggart:**
You need not be anything more than a decoration. To stand by my side and represent the image of a good princess.

**Mash:**
I understand, Lord Boggart. The dignity expected of the Princess of Sheffield, you mean?

**Mash:**
By the way, did you get enough rest last night? I'm so very sorry for my rudeness...

**Boggart:**
I'm not even scratched. You don't need to worry.

**Boggart:**
Guards. I will be going to the barracks now. I have to see to the condition of the soldiers.

**Boggart:**
Keep an eye on the princess. And make sure she doesn't leave the castle.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Sir! Leave it to us, Lord Boggart!

**Narration:**
Boggart may have been a cold-hearted fairy, but was an ideal fit to be Lord of Sheffield.

**Narration:**
For the coming confrontation with the Queen's army, he gathered mercenaries, trained his soldiers, and fortified the walls of his castle.

**Narration:**
For the sake of not wanting to lose more than he already had, he strengthened his army.

**Narration:**
Despite his underlying fear, Boggart made for a good king at this time.

**Mash:**
&mdash; (※Mm, acting dignified.)

**Mash:**
&mdash; (※Mmmm, puffing up her chest in a dignified manner.)

**Mash:**
&mdash; (※ Realizes that's probably not what she should be doing.)

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Uh, Lady Mash.

**Mash:**
Y-Yes! I'm the princess, what about it!?

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Yes, I know.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Uh, Lady Mash is Lord Boggart's wife. So does that mean you'll be the ruling Lady of Sheffield?

**Fairy Guardsman:**
If that's the case...Um, for the sake of the people, I have a favor to ask...

**Mash:**
...?

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Lately, there have been a lot of Mors sightings west of Sheffield!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
According to the merchants, Lady Mash can touch the Mors and not get corrupted!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
We of the Fang Clan are relatively more resistant to the Mors' toxin than the others, but...

**Fairy Guardsman:**
It's still...really painful, so...please, lend us your strength!

**Mash:**
So that's why you've brought me outside! Of course, leave everything to me!

**Mash:**
I'll do my best, as the one who accidentally destroyed the castle walls last night! Mmph!

**Habetrot:**
Mmph! So cuuuuuute! But that's wroooooong!

**Habetrot:**
What are you doing with Mash, you well-mannered guaaaard!?

**Habetrot:**
At what point did the Kingdom become so dangerous that we need princesses to fight for us!?

**Habetrot:**
Should I tell Boggart!?

**Fairy Guardsman:**
But protection of one's land is the duty of a lord (and his wife)...and besides, Queen Morgan (the princess) is a villain to begin with...

**Habetrot:**
Did you just call my bride evil, you bastaaaaard! Take a good look at how pretty she is!

**Habetrot:**
She couldn't hurt a butterfly, or even trample a flower! She's the happiest bride on the face of the Earth&mdash;

**Habetrot:**
Why are you wearing armor!? You didn't rip my dress, did you!?

**H：Mash:**
It's no problem! I put it on over the dress, and it fits perfectly!

**Habetrot:**
You'll wrinkle it doing that...and I'll have to finish up a new one later...

**Habetrot:**
But, this comes first!

**Habetrot:**
I won't let Mash fight all by herself! I'll fight by your side!

**H：Mash:**
Eh...you can't, Habenyan! If you touch the Mors, you'll...!

**Habetrot:**
Stuff like extermination of Mors only requires a little creative thinking. Fairies these days have just gotten lazy.

**Habetrot:**
More importantly! My name is Habetrot! Mash, even you are forbidden from calling me Habenyan!

**H：Mash:**
Eh, no way...! Why not!?!&mdash;

**--BATTLE--:**

**Habetrot:**
Hah...hah...

**Habetrot:**
I knew that fighting would be tough, but all that hard work is no fun at all...

**H：Mash:**
Habetrot, you're amazing!

**H：Mash:**
I've never seen a fairy with such sharp movements before!

**Habetrot:**
R-really? That was a craftsman's once-a-day finishing touch dive.

**Habetrot:**
Working on wedding dresses from dusk 'till dawn. Speed Star Habenyan, they call me.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Y-yeah...I was surprised as well. Lord Boggart's judgement is superb.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
That thread-spinning contraption, could it be a creation from the Wing Clan?

**Fairy Guardsman:**
But, the Wing Clan left Muryan behind 1,200 years ago...

**Habetrot:**
Muryan? By Muryan, you mean Game Master Muryan?

**Habetrot:**
Huh, so she's still alive, then. Or maybe her “daughter” has taken over.

**Habetrot:**
Well, doesn't matter. What's important is that we beat the Mors.

**Habetrot:**
We'll be thanked for this, right? You should treat us to a nice lunch.

**Habetrot:**
It might be against the rules to enjoy a meal in front of Boggart, but in town, there's no need to worry.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Yeah, of course! And since we can introduce Lady Mash to everyone, we'll be killing two birds with one stone!

**H：Mash:**
Is this really alright?

**H：Mash:**
Lord Boggart told me to make sure to keep a low profile, so...

**Habetrot:**
It's fine, it's fine! Besides, he won't be back until this evening!

**Habetrot:**
You've had it rough up until now, haven't you? You should enjoy yourself as much as you can.

**Habetrot:**
The fairies of Sheffield love human culture, so there's no bias against humans here.

**Habetrot:**
If we go to the tavern, we can have a big party with you as its focus. Everyone will be happy, Mash will be happy, and I'll be happy!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
That's right. Lord Boggart's forbidden the treatment of humans as slaves here from the get-go.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
We're all fellow outcasts, after all. Everybody's on equal footing here.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
No, if anything, the humans saved us...

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Personally, I also have a human woman I'd like to propose to...

**Habetrot:**
Ah, that's right. Sheffield is a free town.

**Habetrot:**
I was sure it was just Boggart trying to act cool. Queen Morgan's opposite, or something like that.

**H：Mash:**
...Um, by fellow outcasts...?

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Oh, did you not know? Until a hundred years ago, this city was abandoned.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Then Boggart and the rest of us rebuilt it, into the Sheffield you see today.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
We were originally citizens of Norwich, but were banished by Lord Spriggan,

**Fairy Guardsman:**
and had nowhere else to go, so we drifted here. That's why&mdash;

**Fairy Guardsman:**
...That's why we can't overlook what's going on in Norwich.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
The Queen has taken no measures against the Calamity Pool that sprung forth above the city.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
We may have been exiled, but Norwich is our home.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
In an effort to save it, Lord Boggart is flying the flag of rebellion against the Queen.

**Narration:**
In the moments just before the curtain of night fell. In your world, it would be the hour of dusk.

**Narration:**
She stood alone atop the castle walls, looking out over the Fairy Kingdom.

**Narration:**
The twilit sky stretched out without end, over the image of Britain, ever beautiful, yet ever sorrowful.

**Mash:**
&mdash;

**Boggart:**
What are you doing? Did you forget the way back to the castle?

**Mash:**
Boggart. The view is quite beautiful here.

**Boggart:**
Address me as Lord when you speak to me. Don't forget to show me proper respect.

**Boggart:**
It's only natural we should have a good view. This place is meant for keeping an eye out for invaders of our territory.

**Boggart:**
However, what you and I see as “good” is entirely different.

**Boggart:**
This was once a battlefield. Only recently have the bloodstains begun to fade.

**Mash:**
...I'm sorry. I did not know about the circumstances of this town, it was selfish of me.

**Boggart:**
...

**Boggart:**
...to you.

**Mash:**
Yes? What was that, Lord Boggart?

**Boggart:**
&mdash;

**Boggart:**
...nothing. This scenery, it looks good to you?

**Boggart:**
These desolate hills as far as the eye can see. These hills, not of the world of man, ruled by us fairies.

**Mash:**
Yes. To me, they appear irreplaceable.

**Mash:**
When I look at them, I get a feeling of profound loneliness, but also of affection.

**Mash:**
Rob, Wag, Winky...

**Mash:**
All the people who have ended up here, everyone in Sheffield...

**Mash:**
I understand everyone is suffering. I don't quite understand why that is, but...

**Mash:**
Everybody desires “to live here”. They want to live in this city, no matter how difficult.

**Mash:**
I don't think a Britain that wishes for no more than that can be ugly.

**Boggart:**
&mdash;

**Boggart:**
...What a foolish opinion. This is why humans are so troublesome.

**Boggart:**
Return to the castle. You can be seen from the barracks here. Your being here is a distraction to the soldiers.

**Boggart:**
I'll be late tonight. Have Habetrot keep an eye on you.

**Mash:**
Yes. Thank you for your concern, Lord Boggart.

**Mash:**
...and that's what he said. Lord Boggart is a fine lord, isn't he?

**Habetrot:**
You're just being deceived, Mash! There's nothing decent about a man who makes his wife call him by his title!

**Mash:**
I-is that so? I thought that was because of his position as a lord.

**Mash:**
Since when I called him that, he had a very pained look in his eyes...

**Habetrot:**
What the hell, that's even worse! Old lion-face is actually a devoted husband!

**Habetrot:**
Don't mess with my bride, even if your marriage is only for appearances' sake!

**Mash:**
For appearances...you mean, this is a fake marriage...?

**Mash:**
A-am I actually a deceitful vixen who's using her womanly charm to seduce the gentle Lord Boggart...

**Mash:**
Am I actually an unmatched seductress in addition to the Child of Prophecy!?

**Habetrot:**
Hahahahahahahaha, well, maybe you are!

**Habetrot:**
This is too much for Boggart to handle! He's the kind of guy who needs to be hated!

**Habetrot:**
You're his natural enemy! Your predecessors must have really screwed up, Boggart!

**Mash:**
Huh? What do you mean “needs to be hated?”

**Habetrot:**
I'm talking about the underlying desires and special traits of fairies.

**Habetrot:**
“I want to be loved,” “I want to be hated,” “I want to be protected,” “I want to be hurt.”

**Habetrot:**
Human emotions change over time, but the desires of fairies have a fixed direction.

**Habetrot:**
Boggart's trying to suppress his violent impulses through reasoning.

**Habetrot:**
He wants someone to hate, and he can't display his true quality without that.

**Habetrot:**
Well, as long as Mash is Mash, Boggart can't be too rough.

**Mash:**
As long as I am who I am...

**Mash:**
But...how can I do that?

**Mash:**
I have no memories. I didn't even know my own name.

**Mash:**
Until I came here, no, until Rob and the others called me the Child of Prophecy...

**Mash:**
I didn't know what to do or what I should be doing.

**Mash:**
No, from the very start&mdash;

**Mash:**
Did I even have a “self”, before I lost my memories?

**Habetrot:**
...What do you mean?

**Mash:**
...There is one thing I've come to learn from losing my memories.

**Mash:**
There's a void in my heart, like a big hole.

**Mash:**
All fairies have a purpose. You could say it's the “gain they desire”.

**Mash:**
Helping someone for money. Hurting someone for money.

**Mash:**
But I don't have that&mdash;

**Mash:**
It always becomes apparent after I help others.

**Mash:**
I ask myself, “What do I want, now that I've come to help?”

**Mash:**
It's such an empty feeling.

**Mash:**
...And as someone with a heart, that wasn't something that could be endured forever.

**Mash:**
Before I lost my memories, I was probably not even aware of this emptiness.

**Mash:**
But now I understand. Because I can't remember anything else, I can't fool myself anymore.

**Mash:**
There was some part of me missing.

**Mash:**
No, there's a gap waiting to be filled by something, but I stubbornly refused to let it be filled.

**Mash:**
And...I really feel like there's nothing I can do about it.

**Narration:**
Habetrot blinked at the unexpected confession.

**Narration:**
Losing her memories wasn't all bad. She had become aware of an even grander problem.

**Habetrot:**
Right. Not many people understand what kind of personality they have, or what they really want.

**Habetrot:**
They say that you finally understand right before you die, but unfortunately, we're still alive.

**Habetrot:**
What you need is the urge to live in the “present.”  A purpose you can be proud of, to become someone you can love.

**Habetrot:**
You said there's a gap, huh?

**Habetrot:**
It's not just the contemplation of what you should do as a person. It's the desire to act as yourself, what they call an ego.

**Habetrot:**
You don't notice it until you're being supported by someone, but&mdash;

**Habetrot:**
Finding that is a journey for you and you alone, Mash.

**Narration:**
It might seem like a big deal to leave off right in the midst of it, but do not fret.

**Narration:**
She won't get her hands on the answer until much, much later.

**Narration:**
For now, a few small words of encouragement will suffice,

**Narration:**
so that one day, the wheel of time may spin a story just for you.

**--ARROW--:**

**Narration:**
Oops, I forgot an important scene. How about we go back in time for a bit?

**Mash:**
I've been waiting for you, milord. Thank you for your hard work as lord of the city.

**Boggart:**
Hm. The image of a wife showing devotion to her husband, is it?

**Boggart:**
How shrewd. I see through your shallow wisdom, young lady.

**Boggart:**
Your fate is decided if you act obediently.

**Boggart:**
My objective is the throne. I will kill Morgan, even if I have to defeat the clans.

**Boggart:**
Everything is no more than a tool to achieve that. You are no different, “Child of Prophecy”.

**Boggart:**
I'm used to embracing humans. Let's scatter some flowers here.

**Boggart:**
Resist if you so desire. However, don't expect to be treated gently, alright?

**Narration:**
In the room for honored guests at Sheffield Castle, the room reserved for Mash,

**Narration:**
the Child of Prophecy was told to don her wedding gown and await Boggart's visit that evening.

**Narration:**
To put it simply, she was the 62nd bride, and this was her wedding night.

**Boggart:**
Gwaaaaaaaagh&mdash;!?

**Boggart:**
<span style=font-size:25px>Yeeaaaaaaargh!? </span>

**Garden Guard:**
What's going on, is it a siege!? &mdash;Lord B-Boggart!?

**Garden Guard:**
What on earth!? Aah, the wall near the throne is collapsing!

**Garden Guard:**
Everyone, to arms! Lord Boggart's been assassinated!

**Boggart:**
Stop that nonsense, I'm still alive! Don't call the guards! I merely slipped!

**Garden Guard:**
Ah! M-my apologies!

**Garden Guard:**
How very like the Rock Lion, to be unscathed after falling more than 50 meters!

**Voice from Above:**
I-I'm so sorry, Boggart! I'm coming right now!

**Mash:**
Are you hurt!? I'm sorry, I was so very nervous...

**Mash:**
You tried to use my shoulder as support when you stumbled from exhaustion, but&mdash;

**Mash:**
It was so sudden, I reached out...and he just flew off...

**Garden Guard:**
...(silently realizes what has happened)

**Boggart:**
Guardsman. Not a word of this to anyone, understood?

**Garden Guard:**
Sir! I understand! I didn't see a thing!

**Garden Guard:**
Now please excuse me! (The Child of Prophecy is amazing! I can't wait to tell everyone!)

**Boggart:**
...

**Mash:**
Uh, Boggart? Shall I rub your back?

**Boggart:**
No need! You are not to touch me ever again from now on! What sort of wife throws her husband out of his castle on their wedding night!?

**Narration:**
The rumors spread overnight.

**Narration:**
A princess of iron who made even Lord Boggart kneel. She was strong, gentle, and somewhat eccentric.

**Narration:**
It was the arrival of a heretofore unseen Fairy Knight, they said.

**Fairies Gathered in the Tavern:**
I'm telling you, Sheffield's been reborn, ever since Lady Mash came here!

**Fairies Gathered in the Tavern:**
Not only can she fight off the Mors, she's happy to help with anything,

**Fairies Gathered in the Tavern:**
but best of all, she scolds Lord Boggart if he gets too violent! Thanks to her, the old Lord Boggart is back!

**Fairies Gathered in the Tavern:**
This way, we won't lose to the Queen's army! We will take Norwich back!

**D：Wag Toasting with Everyone:**
Three cheers for Lady Mash! Three cheers for Lord Boggart!

**D：Wag Toasting with Everyone:**
Three cheers for our very own knight&mdash;for the Knight of Sheffield!

**Fairies & Wag:**
Hip hip, hooray!

**Rob:**
...Man, Wag sure doesn't have a care in the world. Knight of Sheffield, my ass.

**Rob:**
Mash is the Child of Prophecy, not just a knight for this town.

**Rob:**
I mean, the princess dress is nice, but...it's something special, after all.

**Rob:**
If you ask us, Mash looks elegant even wearing that iron armor of hers...

**Habetrot:**
You jealous of Boggart, Rob? You're the ones who brought her here.

**Rob:**
Of course not, it's just weird how the people here keep putting her on a pedestal!

**Rob:**
...Not that we didn't do the same thing.

**Rob:**
Every morning, I see Mash on top of the castle walls, looking off into the distance.

**Rob:**
...She seems so lonely. Like she's unhappy, even though she's always smiling.

**Rob:**
I have to wonder if we might have made a mistake in bringing her here.

**Habetrot:**
...Hmm.

**Habetrot:**
Then you think she might not be the Child of Prophecy, Rob?

**Rob:**
...Hm. We just picked her up off the side of the road at first. To begin with she was...well, just another piece of merchandise.

**Rob:**
And despite that, we had feelings for her before we knew it. We talked with her like she was one of us.

**Rob:**
...Wag and me aren't from the Fairy Kingdom. We're just fairies from somewhere else that washed ashore.

**Rob:**
They call us flotsam. Objects, humans, fairies...

**Rob:**
It just happens sometimes. We're Changelings like that.

**Habetrot:**
(Flotsam? I've never heard of this...but I guess that's what happens under Morgan's rule.)

**Rob:**
We don't belong to any clan, and we aren't Nature Spirits either. So there's no place for us.

**Rob:**
Her Majesty Morgan's soldiers will capture you, draw Command Spells on you, and then leave you for dead.

**Rob:**
Even if they leave you be, at the end of the year you will die when your tax is squeezed out.

**Rob:**
Killing isn't necessary. That's why I was desperate to do whatever jobs I could find.

**Rob:**
Wag's just that kind of guy. No matter what's happening, he's just oblivious...

**Rob:**
Well, I'm the older brother, so I gotta take care of him.

**Rob:**
Every year, survival became the only thing I cared about. I guess I have that to thank for why I haven't turned into a Mors yet, then.

**Rob:**
Well, I forgot a few things in exchange. Hesitation. Wonderment. Compassion.

**Rob:**
Before I knew it, I started thinking of myself as a legitimate scoundrel, and just did whatever I wanted.

**Rob:**
That would have been easy enough.

**Rob:**
With that girl though, I knew I hadn't forgotten.

**Rob:**
...the Child of Prophecy will save the fairies of the Fairy Kingdom. We're just outcasts. It doesn't matter to us.

**Rob:**
So maybe she's not the real deal. The Child of Prophecy won't save us.

**Rob:**
Annis is but a fake...she's something more than the Child of Prophecy...

**Habetrot:**
Maybe then, you're still in town because&mdash;

**Rob:**
What do you know, idiot!? Get the hell out of here! You're just the princess' tailor! Quit selling your bullshit!

**Habetrot:**
That's right. I'm Habetrot the Seamstress, friend of all brides.

**Habetrot:**
Leave guarding Mash to me. If we're ever in trouble, I'll come to you first.

**D：Rowdy Fairies & Wag:**
Yeah! Who's afraid of the Queen or the Mors!? We'll protect Mash!

**Rob:**
...Sigh. You were right after all, Winky.

**Rob:**
If we had parted sooner, none of this would...? Winky? Hey, where'd he go?

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Lord Boggart. The 4th Platoon has returned from Edinburgh.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
They were unable to meet with Knocknarea personally, but negotiations went smoothly.

**Boggart:**
We've managed to get the iron weapons. Send the weapons to the fairies, and the armor to the humans' barracks.

**Boggart:**
The humans will assist the fairy soldiers with their presence.

**Boggart:**
I don't expect much from their raw strength. It's enough if they avoid dying.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Sir. I'll have the tailor fit your armor right away.

**Boggart:**
Has the Child of Prophecy gone into town again? I thought I told her to stay by the throne.

**Boggart:**
A lord's wife should not be so thoughtless. Who is giving her these ideas? Is it Habetrot?

**Boggart:**
She thinks she can push her luck just because she's useful as a tailor. Tell her there won't be a next time, even in regards to the Child of Prophecy.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Ah, well...

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Lady Mash said she wanted to be helpful to Lord Boggart in her own way.

**Boggart:**
Only those who obey are of any use to me!

**Boggart:**
In Sheffield, I am the law! No matter the reason, the punishment for disobedience is death!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Aaaah...!

**Habetrot:**
Heya, I heard you got your hands on some weapons? I just came to check if you got a bunch of garbage or not!

**Habetrot:**
Hm? What, is Boggart in a mood again?

**Habetrot:**
Are you upset that Mash isn't here? I see, I see, Mash is real strong after all.

**Habetrot:**
I heard troops are on their way here from New Darlington.

**Habetrot:**
Does the great rebel lord want his wife by his side to protect him?

**Boggart:**
I need no one's protection! I don't want to be bothered by having that girl anywhere near me!

**Habetrot:**
Then, it doesn't matter where Mash is! ☆

**Habetrot:**
As far as you're concerned, all you need is for her to be in Sheffield, right?

**Boggart:**
...tch. You don't know when to shut up. I'd twist your head off if I could replace you.

**Boggart:**
Very well. The Child of Prophecy can do as she pleases during the day hours.

**Boggart:**
But you're taking quite the tone with me, Habetrot. I expect you've brought some appropriate results.

**Boggart:**
The iron cylinder that was brought in with that girl... it's similar to the spear Morgan carries.

**Boggart:**
Can you figure out its inner workings? Is it something we can make use of?

**Habetrot:**
...I don't know how it works, but if you just want to shoot it, that should be fine.

**Habetrot:**
I can tell that's not its original purpose, though... somehow, just touching it makes me feel sick.

**Habetrot:**
I think it's a weapon that shouldn't exist in this world...

**Habetrot:**
Mash, why do you have something like that... it really doesn't suit you at all...

**Boggart:**
Indeed. She never mentions the cylinder.

**Boggart:**
Perhaps she's unconsciously avoiding it. ...you could even say she's trying to escape it.

**Habetrot:**
Wow, that's pretty perceptive for you, Boggart. I'm of the same opinion, but let's be honest&mdash;

**Boggart:**
I don't care about the Child of Prophecy. Can it be used as a weapon?

**Habetrot:**
Well, yeah. I mean, it's a cannon. Do you know what that is? No?

**Habetrot:**
You put a bullet, or magical energy in this case, in the chamber, compress it, and with combustion it's forcibly expelled.

**Habetrot:**
But it sucks up a lot of magical energy. The fairy who shoots it will likely succumb to fatigue.

**Habetrot:**
If you want to make use of it, do so yourself, Boggart. Don't force it on your soldiers.

**Habetrot:**
It's not something your average fairy can withstand.

**Boggart:**
So you're saying it's only to be used by the strong?

**Boggart:**
Hmph. How appropriate. A good representation of my ability as king.

**Habetrot:**
Guess there's nothing you can say to someone with a rock for a brain...

**Habetrot:**
More importantly, about what I said before...

**Habetrot:**
The Queen's army is coming here. Are you ready for them?

**Habetrot:**
As the lord of this city, what countermeasures do you have planned?

**Boggart:**
Thanks to our supporters in Camelot, we know who we'll be facing.

**Boggart:**
It's the Queen's 3rd Division.

**Boggart:**
About 2,000 men. The Queen probably judged that as sufficient.

**Boggart:**
&mdash;hah.

**Boggart:**
Hahahahaha! How naive of her!

**Boggart:**
They won't even get past Sheffield's walls.

**Boggart:**
Our walls are made from bark peeled off the World Tree. They can't be destroyed so easily.

**Boggart:**
Without Fairy Knights, the Queen's soldiers pose no threat. I'll let them wear themselves out against the castle walls.

**Boggart:**
Now that Knocknarea is prepared to head south, the Queen doesn't have the luxury of sending reinforcements.

**Boggart:**
Seven days. If we hold out for seven days, the 3rd Division won't have the strength to keep up the siege.

**Boggart:**
After that it's up to me and my elite. We'll unleash all the resentment we built up during that time.

**Habetrot:**
I see, you've thought this through. I've got no need to worry.

**Habetrot:**
So have you told Mash this is going to turn into a battleground in the next few days yet?

**Habetrot:**
In terms of fighting strength, she's on par with a Fairy Knight. Aren't you going to tell her?

**Boggart:**
No. How many times must I tell you? She's not needed!

**Boggart:**
The Child of Prophecy only needs to raise the morale of the troops. Anything else is a distraction.

**Boggart:**
Don't presume too much, Habetrot. She's nothing more than window dressing.

**Mash:**
Good evening, Lord Boggart. I see you've come to see me tonight as well.

**Boggart:**
I didn't come because I wanted to. The gate guards are nearby, I had no choice.

**Boggart:**
It's a disgrace for a member of the Fang Clan to visit the chambers of a woman he doesn't even embrace...

**Boggart:**
It's against my principles to waste time. Tonight is...

**Boggart:**
Let's discuss the Child of Prophecy. I'm told you have no memories, but how much do you know?

**Mash:**
...I'm sorry. A fairy turning 16 this year, who will save Britain. That's all I know.

**Boggart:**
&mdash;How crude. This goes beyond even a lack of knowledge.

**Mash:**
...

**Boggart:**
...It was 16 years ago now.

**Boggart:**
The head of the Mirror Clan, Ainsel, possessed the Sacrament of being able to predict the future.

**Boggart:**
“A savior that will save Britain has been born. In due time, a true king will appear to defeat the false king.”

**Boggart:**
That was her prophecy.

**Boggart:**
Queen Morgan rounded up all the fairies born that year and executed them, but her purge was incomplete.

**Boggart:**
There are many villages that hide their opposition to her.

**Boggart:**
Some of them sent away their newborn fairies, entrusting their hopes to them.

**Boggart:**
That being the case, there were also towns which raised fairies that year, in an attempt to bring about the Child of Prophecy.

**Boggart:**
Or perhaps they wanted to present them to the Queen 16 years later...like a neatly wrapped gift.

**Boggart:**
Whatever the case, the “Child of Prophecy” is very valuable, even by itself. Every faction was searching frantically for it.

**Boggart:**
Nobody doubted Ainsel's prophecy.

**Boggart:**
Why, you ask? Because they knew the precedent. There will be a savior born in Britain.

**Boggart:**
One to purify the great calamity every 1,000 years... one who can sing with the voice of paradise.

**Boggart:**
However, records from the Fairy Calendar are lost to us. There are only two things that remain.

**Boggart:**
The first is from the year 4000 of the Fairy Calendar. That would be more than 6,000 years ago.

**Boggart:**
When Britain was on the verge of collapse due to a war between the clans, a single fairy brought about salvation, at the cost of their own life.

**Boggart:**
The second is the Summer War in the year 2000 of the Fairy Calendar. The war with the northern fairies who came ashore from the Island of Shadows.

**Boggart:**
Our ancestors were driven to the brink of extinction by iron-wielding soldiers led by Queen Mab.

**Boggart:**
Once again, a single fairy stepped between both sides, subdued the conflict, and laid the foundation for the six clans of the present day.

**Boggart:**
The name of this savior was “Tonelico”.

**Boggart:**
After stopping the war between the clans, the savior was laid to rest in the lands furthest to Britain's north, the shunned land of Orkney.

**Boggart:**
...Hrm. The ignorant masses claim that the “Child of Prophecy” is the reincarnation of that savior, but...

**Boggart:**
I don't care either way. No matter how many times they save Britain, in the end, we cannot win.

**Boggart:**
Because the Calamities still come back. You can hardly call them a “Savior”.

**Boggart:**
If those abominable Mors and the incessant Calamities had vanished along with them, then I'd permit them that name.

**Mash:**
...“Calamity.” Everyone in this town fears that word as well.

**Mash:**
No, even before we came here, fairies in every city feared it.

**Mash:**
No matter how ruthless Queen Morgan is, she has quelled the Calamities up until now.

**Mash:**
That's why you need to follow her, even though you fear her. I guess...

**Boggart:**
That's right. Morgan declared that she was forsaking Norwich.

**Boggart:**
The perfect opportunity. The first huge gap in the Queen's defenses revealing itself since Tristan's designation as heir.

**Mash:**
...? Lord Boggart, are you pleased?

**Boggart:**
One needs a reason to raise an army. Rather, to recruit troops, you need a cause.

**Boggart:**
Norwich is a unique opportunity, Mash, for me to take the throne for myself.

**Boggart:**
I have no intention of saving Norwich. But I will make good use of it.

**Boggart:**
My declaration is a simple one. The restoration of Norwich and the elimination of the “Calamity Pool”.

**Boggart:**
Until those are fulfilled, Sheffield will not obey Camelot.

**Boggart:**
The Queen will to have to accept my conditions, or suppress Sheffield's army.

**Boggart:**
To tell the truth, it doesn't matter what she does. Her armies will be exhausted either way.

**Boggart:**
In the meantime, by colluding with the fairies of the north and joining arms with the Round Table Army in the south,

**Boggart:**
I will raise an army of my own, one to rival the Queen's.

**Boggart:**
You are the catalyst of that cause, “Child of Prophecy”. I do not expect you to save Britain, or anything of the sort.

**Boggart:**
Understand? The fact that you remember nothing matters not.

**Boggart:**
At best, keep up appearances for the hope of the people.

**Boggart:**
For someone like you, that's about as much as you are good for.

**Mash:**
&mdash;

**Hooded Fairy:**
...that's the current state of things in Sheffield.

**Hooded Fairy:**
There's about 3,000 of Boggart's soldiers, 2,000 assorted fairies, and 300 humans.

**Hooded Fairy:**
They're still steadily gathering forces now, so... won't they become more of a problem, the more time we give them?

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
...Seems like it.

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Shit. Her Majesty gave Sheffield dispensation to assemble military force to prepare against the northern fairies, but...

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
To assemble 5,000 rebels... We've never had an insurrection on this scale before.

**Hooded Fairy:**
Seems like Lady Tristan's games have gone too far...

**Hooded Fairy:**
The number of fairies she's killed without reason since the founding of New Darlington has finally come to light.

**Hooded Fairy:**
All of Britain has doubts in both Lady Tristan,

**Hooded Fairy:**
and of Queen Morgan's judgement in knighting her, so...

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Quell thy tongue... there is no need to state that which is so painfully obvious.

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
We swore an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty. Save your frivolous opinions.

**Hooded Fairy:**
Sorry for that... just a slip of the tongue.

**Hooded Fairy:**
So, what about my payment?

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
...Fine. Hey, pay him.

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
He may have lost his position, but Boggart is still a Fang Clan head. He's worth more than a thousand fairies on his own.

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Send word to Camelot as soon as possible, so that we may obtain Lord Gawain's aid.

**Hooded Fairy:**
...What about the Child of Prophecy? That was the crown jewel of my tip-off.

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Don't make me laugh. We caught one of those yesterday.

**Queen's Army・Knight:**
It's probably just Boggart's entourage, and as such, it's not even worth confirming.

**Voice from Behind the Tent:**
Oh, I'm not so sure that is strictly true, Officer.

**Voice from Behind the Tent:**
There was no lie in his story. The part about the Child of Prophecy was especially good.

**Voice from Behind the Tent:**
“Black iron armor, a large shield, the appearance of a 16-year-old girl,” and&mdash;

**Voice from Behind the Tent:**
“A black iron cylinder that makes you uneasy just by looking at it,” was it?

**Beryl:**
Well well, now you've got my attention. Tell me a little more, bro.

**Beryl:**
Well? What's her name? You do know it, right?

**Beryl:**
You came here to sell some information, yet you've conveniently left that part out.

**Beryl:**
Bit shady, don't you think? I think you know, and yet you're choosing to not tell us.

**Hooded Fairy:**
...Is that how it sounds? Sorry, but you're imagining things. I really don't know.

**Hooded Fairy:**
You'll have to excuse me, if there's no further payment. I'd like to be back in the south by tomorrow.

**Beryl:**
There's no need to rush. You've come all this way, so why don't we take our time, and have a nice little chat?

**Beryl:**
Hey, I'm sure you'll remember soon enough, Winky. After all, that's what your expression is telling me.

## Section 6: Wales (I) 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's so peaceful...|

**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah. You should get some rest while you can. Now that we've left Gloucester, the strength of enemies will return to normal.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Even something that appears to be a single squirrel might be on the same level as a Servant, you know?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How far is it to Wales?

**Oberon:**
Hmm, we're not using the national highway, and since we're trying not to stand out by taking the back roads...

**Oberon:**
Well, at this pace we might make it there by nightfall? Provided nothing weird happens☆


---

**Artoria:**
...

**Da Vinci:**
What is it, Artoria? You've been strangely quiet for a while now.

**Artoria:**
...I don't want to make Fujimaru nervous, but how do I put this...

**Artoria:**
...I keep having this sinking feeling...like we're being watched by someone...

**Artoria:**
As if, in about five seconds, the carriage will be flipped over...

**Red Rabbit:**
Hahaha, you jest. I am Red Rab-bit, fairy horse with the grace of the Wind Clan.

**Red Rabbit:**
Overturning my carriage when I have passengers is simply prepos&mdash;

**Oberon:**
Are we under attack!? Everyone, out of the carriage!

**Senji Muramasa:**
No, the carriage itself wasn't attacked, a wheel just ran over something.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Master Red Horse! Is the road really that bad!?

**Red Rabbit:**
No, it's...my sincerest apologies, I was composing a poem while looking up at the sky,

**Red Rabbit:**
so I didn't notice all these fairies lying collapsed in the road!

**Red Rabbit:**
Amazing! Terrible! One, two, three, four...there are six obstacles in all!

**Six Fairies:**
Uuh...alive...I'm still alive...help...please help us...

**Six Fairies:**
We lost control...of our cargo...and it attacked us... hi-ho...

**Six Fairies:**
We don't seem too badly hurt, if at all, but,

**Six Fairies:**
it took one of us...to a secluded cave beyond that hill... right?

**Six Fairies:**
Please...won't you help us...somehow? You are...kind... suckers, right?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wasn't the end of your statement a little suspicious?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
"Most Suspicious Fairies", position #1 updated!


---

**Artoria:**
&mdash;We're on it! It's that hill, right!?

**Artoria:**
Everyone, follow me! If we don't hurry, we'll have major trouble!

**Da Vinci:**
Wait, really!? Ah geez, you're so stupidly honest!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Amazing, that girl's gone full circle. I don't know how she's managed to survived this long...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon, keep an eye on the carriage!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Keep an eye on those fairies!


---

**Oberon:**
Sure, see you later. I'll hold down the fort.

**--BATTLE--:**

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Hi-hoooooooo! I thought I was done for, but we made it!

**The Seventh Fairy:**
I'm done shopping in Gloucester! I shouldn't have let myself be suckered into that deal!

**Senji Muramasa:**
You were...really in trouble...?

**Da Vinci:**
...Yeah. That was actually dangerous...

**Da Vinci:**
We should have listened no matter how shady they sounded...how shameful...

**Artoria:**
Are you hurt at all? Did any other fairy get taken?

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Naw, we're seven fairies in one, so there's no such thing as an eighth!

**The Seventh Fairy:**
But you guys are pretty strong. As far as the redheaded dude is concerned at least, aren't ya?

**The Seventh Fairy:**
The lass just posed a different kind of danger, though.

**The Seventh Fairy:**
There was this huge bang, and we were almost killed, along with our guards.

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Follow the other little miss' example, why don't you?

**The Seventh Fairy:**
She threw all kinds of stuff around too, but none of it came near us.

**The Seventh Fairy:**
It's alright to be rowdy, but be aware of your surroundings, okay? Especially when there's hostages involved.

**The Seventh Fairy:**
If I were someone else, I might have sued you.

**Artoria:**
Y-yes...that was...

**Artoria:**
I know I'm clumsy so...I'm hoping I'll be able to grow in the long term...

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Oh, good luck with that! You've got guts, kid! I'm rooting for you!

**Da Vinci:**
Hey, Mr. Cheerful Fairy. If you're fine, can we go already?

**Da Vinci:**
No need for your thanks. (He seems like an awful pain in the neck!)

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Oh yeah? I let you help me, and I thought I'd hang around and have some fun...

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Well, we're on our way home from work too. Gotta tell the boss we finished throwing out the trash.

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Sheesh. Buy a trustworthy guard to escort you and this is what you get.

**The Seventh Fairy:**
You saved our lives. For that you have our thanks, little miss simpleton.

**Artoria:**
Garbage disposal...you mean, the Great Pit at Camelot?

**Artoria:**
I heard that soldiers took over as escorts for that, due to the Mors...

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Oh, they can't spare them for that these days. Why do you think we bought one in Gloucester?

**The Seventh Fairy:**
From a real beauty. Said “the adjustment was a failure, so I'll give it to you at a discount.”

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Koyanskaya...|

**Senji Muramasa:**
To force a sale of something so useless on you... she's a real piece of work, she is.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Garbage disposal...?

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Eh? Don't you know, {(M) son /(F) girl}? Ah, fresh off the farms, are you?


---

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Still, there were no Mors gathering near the Great Pit. I guess they really must all be gathering at Norwich.

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Aah, what will become of this land in the future?

**The Seventh Fairy:**
The nuisance of the Fang Clan, Gawain. Her Majesty's eccentric daughter, Tristan.

**The Seventh Fairy:**
The only sane one is Lord Lancelot. I'd rather just escape up north...

**The Seventh Fairy:**
No, no way!

**The Seventh Fairy:**
We're the seven merry brothers, servants of Lady Aurora!

**The Seventh Fairy:**
Hi-ho, Hi-ho! Off to work we go!

**The Seventh Fairy:**
See you, everybody! You watch out for the Mors too!

**Artoria, Muramasa, da Vinci & Fujimaru:**
(Dumbfounded)

**???:**
...I see. I see...!

**Oberon:**
For the record, the fact that we didn't make it there by the end of the day wasn't my fault.

**Oberon:**
Artoria just kept getting into the same kind of trouble over and over.

**Oberon:**
You understand, right?

**Oberon:**
Also, are you a magnet for disaster, Fujimaru? Do you not have any luck at all?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Now that you mention it...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No, none at all.


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
Still, that was great for landing a few test blows.

**Senji Muramasa:**
The Fairy Kingdom has differed a little too much from the Lostbelts up 'till now. I finally have a grasp on how hard my blades have to be.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Artoria's magecraft ain't so bad, either.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I don't get why such a skill is said to be “without value” here, but...

**Senji Muramasa:**
It's a great match for me. The run of the scabbard is in a league of its own. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with you all.

**Artoria:**
S-sure. I'll be the one in your care, though.

**Artoria:**
(I see...in Muramasa's case, unlike the fairy soldiers, he doesn't fight with just his own magical energy...)

**Artoria:**
(He makes use of external enchantments—magical energy bestowal—as if they were his own...)

**Oberon:**
Muramasa's strength is definitely a cut above.

**Oberon:**
You said you're an Alter Ego, but could it be you're not a pure Servant?

**Da Vinci:**
Oh, that's...might we explain it, Muramasa?

**Senji Muramasa:**
Sure, I don't care. Let's take this opportunity to discuss a few things, Fujimaru.

**Senji Muramasa:**
It'll be troublesome to explain if you say something like “I trusted you, but you were really my enemy all along?!” later on.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...It's a long story, but...|


---

**Artoria:**
So you're saying, he's some kind of impure Servant produced by something called the Alien God?

**Artoria:**
And before now, he's been Fujimaru's enemy...?

**Da Vinci:**
Pretty much. He did something especially extraordinary during our last moments in Olympus.

**Da Vinci:**
Muramasa. You're a powerful Servant who severed the Saint Graph of the Titan Atlas.

**Da Vinci:**
And yet you failed your assassination attempt on Queen Morgan, and were defeated by another fairy entirely.

**Da Vinci:**
I'm having a hard time believing that. Can you offer some sort of explanation?

**Senji Muramasa:**
There's really nothing odd about it. I'm an Alter Ego who specializes in slaying gods.

**Senji Muramasa:**
The Alien God incorporated that kind of Divine Spirit into me.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Some kind of blind God of War, who brought about the Twilight of the Gods.

**Senji Muramasa:**
The other god is...my dearest wish, or rather, my aspiration. Well, I'd rather you don't ask me about that.

**Senji Muramasa:**
What? It's not like I'm especially strong. I just don't have to expend my magical energy when “slaying gods”.

**Senji Muramasa:**
It was most suited for Olympus, but Scandinavia... well, it would have been another matter, I guess.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Scáthach-Skadi, right?

**Senji Muramasa:**
If this Alter Ego of mine would have met her, I imagine she would have been pretty upset.

**Senji Muramasa:**
If only that blind God of War hadn't been deceived...

**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, that about sums it up.

**Senji Muramasa:**
In worlds where gods and Divine Spirits are prevalent, that's where I shine as an apostle, you know.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're strong, so long as you're fighting gods...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then conversely...


---

**Da Vinci:**
...I see. I had a bit of an inkling, but you cleared it up.

**Da Vinci:**
There's no concept of “religion” here. Meaning&mdash;

**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah. There aren't any gods in Britain.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I don't know the particulars of how the world ended up this way though.

**Senji Muramasa:**
A world dominated by fairies, but there's no sign of the greatest Mystery of them all: a god.

**Oberon:**
Well, isn't that to be expected? Don't only humans pray to the gods?

**Oberon:**
Fairies are all-powerful, so there's no need for them to seek salvation from beings greater than themselves.

**Oberon:**
Inevitably, the concept of “a god” will never come to exist in their society.

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm...well, when you put it like that, it definitely makes sense...

**Da Vinci:**
...I'll have to compile some notes on all this later. I need Holmes' take on this...

**Artoria:**
I don't really get all this “god” stuff, so I can't comment...

**Artoria:**
Muramasa, you're definitely Fujimaru's enemy, aren't you?

**Artoria:**
You saved us by coming along, but mutual enemies travelling together is...

**Senji Muramasa:**
You don't need to worry, Artoria. Didn't I tell you in Gloucester?

**Senji Muramasa:**
Now that you saved me, I'm part of the Child of Prophecy's retinue. That's easier for me.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I don't want to nitpick my job, but...this way, I can finally get motivated.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't like working for the Alien God?|


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
Of course not, it's all a bit of a bad joke, if you ask me!

**Senji Muramasa:**
I don't even know who or what this “Alien God” is!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Summoning me and fusing a bunch of stuff into me without my consent, then unilaterally compelling me to do its dirty work.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I'm an arms dealer, so I don't really want to comment on good and evil at this point, but...

**Senji Muramasa:**
When I was alive, as someone sworn to the Buddha, I couldn't perform any heretical work.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, I'm fused with a bunch of other things now. There's no right or wrong to speak of.

**Senji Muramasa:**
That's why I do what I have to do, in order to get the job done. As Muramasa, it's the least I can do.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Yeah. Muramasa was that kind of Heroic Spirit.|

**Senji Muramasa:**
Well. If I were true to the Heroic Spirit Muramasa, it'd be without doubt.

**Senji Muramasa:**
As you can see, I'm but a more humble Muramasa. But I'm useful in my own way.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So now you're saying you took the job to help Artoria?

**Senji Muramasa:**
...well, that's what I meant.

**Senji Muramasa:**
What? What are you smirking at me for? You're kind of a brat, you know that?


---

**Da Vinci:**
I see. Well, if that's the case, we'll put our trust in you as well.

**Da Vinci:**
We need as much strength as we can get, and if it's from a Heroic Spirit we know already, then all the better.

**Da Vinci:**
Nice to be working with you, Senji Muramasa. Even if it's only during this Lostbelt, I'm glad to have you with us.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah. After all, you've already paid in full, so I'll gladly lend you a hand, no strings attached.

**Senji Muramasa:**
...Well, that aside...

**Senji Muramasa:**
I don't really want to ask, but we were associates, after all...

**Senji Muramasa:**
What was Limbo's death like?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It was the worst.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It sucked.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was the right thing to do.


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
...I see.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Alright! Pretend I never asked! Let's get to sleep!

**???:**
...are you awake? ...you're not awake, are you...?

**???:**
...you're all sleeping so soundly...that's a good thing, I think...

**???:**
....Hwaaaa, I'm sleepy too, but I gotta guard, gotta guard...

**???:**
...no sign of any shady characters....no sign of Mors...

**???:**
...leave it to me...leave it to me...I'll take care of you, Artoria...

**???:**
...I'll protect..protec...

**???:**
......zzzzzz......

**--ARROW--:**

**Oberon:**
We've arrived. This is my domain, the Autumn Forest of Wales!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The colors of autumn are everywhere...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(There doesn't seem to be any city or village...)

**Oberon:**
Hey everyone, I'm back. I brought guests today.

**Oberon:**
Of the same standing as me, the one who beholds for themselves, Fujimaru.

**Oberon:**
The cute little renaissance genius, da Vinci. The one who probably makes a lot of stuff for everyone, kind old Muramasa.

**Oberon:**
And the Child of Prophecy, Artoria.

**Oberon:**
How about that? No matter how forsaken this place is, the Child of Prophecy will always come.

**Oberon:**
I told you I wasn't lying, didn't I?

**Artoria:**
A-ah...! Oberon, what do I do with them!?

**Oberon:**
You don't have to do anything. They're just overjoyed that you're here.

**Oberon:**
Ah, they may look cute, but don't hug them.

**Oberon:**
They're not used to being touched, especially by fairies from the outside, you understand?

**Da Vinci:**
This is right out of a storybook. I feel like we've finally arrived in an actual “fairyland.”

**Senji Muramasa:**
Well a fairy's a fairy, right? There's nothing special about this place&mdash;

**G：Welsh Fairy:**

**Senji Muramasa:**
...Okay, they're a bit different. I don't quite understand, but...

**Senji Muramasa:**
You want a helmet that fits you?

**Senji Muramasa:**
True, you can't use human armor if you look like that.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Oberon, you got space for me to set up a workshop?

**Oberon:**
Of course. Make yourself at home. Ah, but keep the materials to tree branches and leaves.

**Oberon:**
They all just want to play soldier. They just want something that looks the part.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I know, I won't make the real thing! They'll just be imitations!

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whoa, whoa, whoa...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I know they're being very welcoming, but I don't really understand!)


---

**Oberon:**
You're all being welcomed.

**Oberon:**
Everyone who washed ashore in this forest doesn't know the concept of mistrusting others.

**Oberon:**
There's no imitation of human culture here, but we can at least prepare some tents.

**Oberon:**
You guys should get some rest. I'll gather information from the outside.

**Oberon:**
Guys, I'm leaving the guests to you.

**Oberon:**
It's alright, there's nobody here who will hurt you.

**Oberon:**
Right. Then it's goodbye for a short while, ladies and gents!

**Oberon:**
But I'll be back by evening, so be sure to leave some dinner for me!

**Da Vinci:**
Ah, wait a minute, Oberon, at least teach us the language&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
...and he's gone.

**Da Vinci:**
Well, I get that the fairies are welcoming us, but...

**Red Rabbit:**
Indeed. The Welsh fairies are a bit difficult to understand, are they not?

**Red Rabbit:**
Also, he neglected to introduce me. Am I really so unobtrusive?

**Red Rabbit:**
Is Lord Oberon like that? A bit of a scatterbrain, perhaps?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, that was just by chance...I think?|

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Dang...I forgot he was here too...)

“Sweet foods” are restricted and a rarity in the south, but here they can get around that!

**Fujimaru 1:**
Restricted...?|

**Fujimaru 2:**
Prohibited...?


---

**Da Vinci:**
Oh, Mike mentioned that too. You can't get your hands on sweets unless you're a high-class fairy.

**Da Vinci:**
The Queen prohibits the processing of things like fruit. Sugar is a rare commodity.

**Red Rabbit:**
I too once received a small piece of what appeared to be a black slab from Lady Aurora, but...

**Red Rabbit:**
To be honest, I prefer carrots. The nature of the sweetness is different.

**Welsh Fairy:**

**Da Vinci:**
Seems like there's a dining table over there.

**Da Vinci:**
I don't understand a word, but let's take them up on their offer, Fujimaru.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, let's.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Only the sweets!


---

**Artoria:**
Thanks for the food!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for the food!|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, it was really good! Especially the grapes, they were suuuuuper gorgeous!

**Da Vinci:**
Even the fruit has a bit of Mystery to it.

**Da Vinci:**
They're pretty good as a means of replenishing magical energy for a Servant's body.

**Da Vinci:**
Maybe I'll pack some for emergencies...or to deliver to Holmes and the others...

**Red Rabbit:**
Chomp, chomp. (Devours a pear in one bite)

**Senji Muramasa:**
Still, this is a lot of food. Is this Oberon's share? Is it alright to just leave this?

**Welsh Fairies:**

**Da Vinci:**
Huh? They all suddenly shot up the trees and into the tree trunks&mdash;

**Red Rabbit:**
(Chomp.) You can see a Black Dog over there. (Chomp.) I believe they all went to hide?

**Artoria:**
Ah! Let's get rid of them in return for them feeding us!

**Red Rabbit:**
I sink sho as well. Excuse me. I think so as well.

**Red Rabbit:**
Black Dogs are terrifying creatures, and the fairies here have no means to fight.

**Red Rabbit:**
Until now they have had no choice but to sacrifice themselves, but now that we are here, that is not the case.

**Red Rabbit:**
Let us teach them a lesson, everyone! The Dog! Is no match! For the Rabbit!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you sure you're not actually a Servant?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is this really what pan-human history amounts to?


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Artoria:**
Wh-what was with that Black Dog? It was absurdly strong...

**Red Rabbit:**
Was that not a fairy bitten by a Black Dog, driven mad by the pain?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that different from the Mors?|

**Red Rabbit:**
Yes. When fairies become Mors, they lose their purpose, their brilliance, and become “meaningless,”

**Red Rabbit:**
and the fact that such “meaninglessness” is contagious when touching Mors is the cause.

**Red Rabbit:**
On the other hand, a fairy who becomes so absorbed in their purpose that they lose sight of themselves will continue to generate magical energy without end,

**Red Rabbit:**
to the point that they will be unable to maintain their form. I suppose you could call them evil fairies.

**Artoria:**
The fairies of the Nameless Forest were like that...

**Artoria:**
When they got hold of a human, they lost control of their inhibitions, and in the end they all killed each other.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's a Black Dog?

**Artoria:**
Evil fairies that devour their own kind. They've been appearing here for some time now.

**Artoria:**
Black Dogs are the only fairies that eat other fairies... well, with one exception.

**Red Rabbit:**
Originally, “fairy eating” was one of the Great Calamities that occured a long time ago,

**Red Rabbit:**
but it is said that it was sealed by the head of the Fang Clan at the time.

**Red Rabbit:**
But in return, the Fang Clan was cursed...or so the story goes.

**Da Vinci:**
It looks like the fairies are happy we got rid of them.

**Da Vinci:**
Right. We'll probably stay here a few days, so let's set up camp.

**Da Vinci:**
Now that we're here, I can't help but worry about what's going on outside.

**Da Vinci:**
Let's get some rest for now and wait for Oberon to come back.

**--ARROW--:**

 ~After dinner~

**Da Vinci:**
You know, I've wondered for a while now...

**Da Vinci:**
When it comes to fairies, what is the structure of “family” like?

**Da Vinci:**
I saw relationships like brothers and sisters in Salisbury, but I didn't see any of parents and children.

**Oberon:**
Of course you didn't. All fairies are born independently, after all.

**Oberon:**
Fairies with similar attributes will refer to each other as siblings,

**Oberon:**
or, as in the case of the “seven fairies” we saw yesterday, they could have been a “set of seven” since they were born.

**Oberon:**
I suppose that's just what it is to be a fairy.

**Da Vinci:**
Then what about “daughters?”

**Da Vinci:**
I heard that Fairy Knight Tristan is Morgan's daughter, so how does that work?

**Oberon:**
Hahaha, Tristan isn't Morgan's daughter! It just means she's the heir to the throne.

**Oberon:**
In human terms, you could say Morgan adopted Tristan.

**Oberon:**
Among fairies, their “daughters” and “sons” are actually those born in the “next generation” to come after their own deaths.

**Oberon:**
Let's see... Hm, for example: let's say there's a “spool fairy A”.

**Oberon:**
Having lived for 100 years, “spool fairy A” has fulfilled their purpose and will go to sleep.

**Oberon:**
But the position of a “spool fairy” and the way of being one will not have disappeared from Britain.

**Oberon:**
After the passing of “spool fairy A,” a “spool fairy B” will be born in Britain.

**Oberon:**
This relationship is simply called the “previous generation” and the “current generation”.

**Da Vinci:**
I see. So then what is passed on to this new generation?

**Da Vinci:**
As humans, we inherit our genes, records, names, our family tree, and so on...

**Oberon:**
Yes. Fairies are born independently, so there is no such connection.

**Oberon:**
The “previous generation” and the “current generation” are completely different fairies. A “record”, or... maybe “stories”, “memories,” well...

**Oberon:**
Fairies who are powerful enough could be able to continue something like that, but it's basically still a brand new “next” part to it.

**Oberon:**
Even so, if their positions are the same, their abilities and appearance would be similar between generations too.

**Oberon:**
That's why no matter where or when they were born, a fairy will always know whether they are a “spool fairy”.

**Oberon:**
In some cases, even though the “current generation” is still alive, a new fairy who resembles them is born.

**Oberon:**
These are rare instances, but in those cases, the new fairy could be considered the “son” or “daughter” of the current generation.

**Oberon:**
That's why fairies who are able to use magecraft are called “Morgan's daughters”.

**Oberon:**
In this Britain, the only ones who are able to use magecraft are Queen Morgan,

**Oberon:**
Tristan, who was given the ability as her successor,

**Oberon:**
and Artoria, who has been able to use it since she was born.

**Oberon:**
Those two would seem, to the rest of the fairies, to both be of the same nature as the queen... hence they are called “Morgan's daughters”.

**Artoria:**
...So, that's why... that Fairy Knight was so hostile toward the Child of Prophecy.

**Artoria:**
There's a rumor going around...that the Child of Prophecy is the daughter of Her Majesty...

**Oberon:**
That's not quite the case, Artoria.

**Oberon:**
It's not because she is Morgan's daughter that she is able to use magecraft. It's because a fairy who wields magecraft can become the next ruler of the Fairy Kingdom.

**Oberon:**
That's how I think it is. That's why Morgan gave Tristan the ability to use magecraft.

**Oberon:**
Something like, “you'll be the next Queen, so you can lay waste to Britain as you please.”

**Oberon:**
This is probably Morgan's way of “breaking the prophecy,” to not let the throne fall into the hands of the Child of Prophecy.

**Oberon:**
But the truth of the matter is, you were born with magecraft. So to Morgan&mdash;

**Oberon:**
No, to Tristan, it's like “there's no way the real one showed up now!”

**Oberon:**
Perhaps the reason she was panicking at the auction house, was because she couldn't stand the fear of what could happen?

**Artoria:**
...I-is that so. Do I... make people scared...

**Oberon:**
Perhaps. Either way, the conflict between you and Tristan isn't one that will be avoidable.

**Oberon:**
But don't worry about it. Let's just take it easy.

**Oberon:**
When you use your magecraft, you are the Child of Prophecy, the one destined to defeat the queen.

**Oberon:**
No matter how strong Morgan is, or how powerful the Fairy Knights are.

**Oberon:**
As long as you are the Child of Prophecy, you are the protagonist of Britain right now.

**Oberon:**
If you do all that is required of you, ultimately, the prophecy will come true.

**Oberon:**
We're just here to help you achieve that. In the end, if you are the one still standing, Britain will be saved.

**Oberon:**
&mdash;Even if we lose a few people along the way.

**Fujimaru 1:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...No good, I can't sleep at all...|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|


---

**Oberon:**
Can't sleep because you have too much on your mind, huh?

**Oberon:**
Ah, sit down. You don't have to get up.

**Oberon:**
I saw you all alone, before I left to gather information.

**Oberon:**
Do you mind if I sit next to you? Great, then I'll help myself.

**Oberon:**
Well then. Do you want to talk about everything that's happened, just to take your mind off things?

**Oberon:**
The story of everything before you arrived in this Lostbelt. The long, long story of your journey here.

**Oberon:**
I see. So that's the story of yours and Chaldea's journey.

**Oberon:**
The future of Earth, the survival of mankind, all the Lostbelts up until now, and the person in front of me here and now.

**Oberon:**
Yeah, I wouldn't be able to sleep with all that either. Especially not that last bit.

**Oberon:**
You feel guilty about the “Child of Prophecy”.

**Oberon:**
No, I think “left out” is what you feel.

**Oberon:**
Artoria will shed a lot of blood going forward. But none of it will be on your hands.

**Oberon:**
Until now, you have been the one who had to do that. That's why you could fight, even if it was difficult.

**Oberon:**
No, that's why you had to fight. Because the burden was all on you.

**Oberon:**
But not this time. You have to leave it to others... you have no choice but to leave it all to Artoria.

**Oberon:**
So you don't know what to think or feel.

**Oberon:**
You might even think of yourself as a coward in this Lostbelt.

**Oberon:**
“We don't actually have any intention of saving this Fairy Kingdom,” you said.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...maybe... that is the case...


---

**Oberon:**
“Our missing teammate is what's most important. If anything happens to Mash, it would be my responsibility.” Right?

**Oberon:**
Oh? Surprised, are you? I can tell if you're pretending to be alright.

**Oberon:**
But, you know...

**Oberon:**
Down the line, if Mash dies in an accident while alone in the streets, is that really your fault?

**Oberon:**
Because you didn't watch and protect her all the time?

**Oberon:**
It wouldn't be. That's not worrying for her. That's just self-criticism and self-harm.

**Oberon:**
Mash is a human being, and it's in humanity's nature to be able to lead their own lives.

**Oberon:**
If you respect her and see her as an equal, then you shouldn't worry so much about her, but trust in her.

**Oberon:**
Taking on the burden all on your own won't do anyone any good. When the crucial moment comes, you'll be too weighed down to act.

**Oberon:**
...Well, from what you told me about your journey so far, it doesn't seem like your mind is getting any lighter.

**Oberon:**
You've always been much less grounded.

**Oberon:**
You're the kind that lives life on your own terms, aren't you?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Live on my own terms...?|


---

**Oberon:**
Yeah, living the way you want doesn't mean living without hardships.

**Oberon:**
What you enjoy, what you desire most.

**Oberon:**
Fighting for them with all your heart, pushing yourself for the things you love, that's what living life on your own terms is all about.

**Oberon:**
That's what was going on during the Incineration of the Human Order. Well, not like I was there to witness it, right?

**Oberon:**
In a way, the two of us are alike. You could say... we have the same role here in Britain.

**Oberon:**
We're just bystanders. Unfortunately, neither you nor I are the main characters of this story.

**Oberon:**
Just like the Fairy King Oberon in “A Midsummer Night's Dream”.

**Oberon:**
The only thing we can do is watch. Support those who have to rush into battle for us.

**Oberon:**
But that doesn't mean you have to beat yourself up.

**Oberon:**
After all, there will definitely be a moment where you have to do what's necessary.

**Oberon:**
The kind of moment where there's no one else by you, with something only you can do, and it will turn the tables.

**Oberon:**
Doesn't that sound cool? But for the time being, we'll have to be patient and continue to look forward to that moment.

**Oberon:**
What's wrong with “just being a bystander”!? Even the audience plays their part!

**Oberon:**
At the very end, we have to show them the grand play that even God himself wouldn't have seen coming!

**Oberon:**
Revealing the tip of fate seems like it'll be a lot of fun!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Pfft, That's just like you, Oberon!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you. I'm feeling a lot better.


---

**Oberon:**
There's no such thing as too crazy. That's what I've always lived by!

**Oberon:**
...Fujimaru.

**Oberon:**
There aren't many people that can explain exactly what kind of person they are.

**Oberon:**
Unlike a tool with a clear instruction manual, we're living beings. We're born uncertain.

**Oberon:**
But you know, everyone knows that there's at least one thing that they're good at.

**Oberon:**
I'm embarrassed to say this, but,

**Oberon:**
in this instance, I don't really think I'm a coward. Of course, neither are you.

**Oberon:**
Oops. Sorry Blanca. I got carried away whilst chatting.

**Oberon:**
We should gather intel on Manchester tonight. It's finally time to gather information about the north.

**Oberon:**
Well, that's it from me. I'll see you again tomorrow night, I don't want to be left without dinner, after all.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
{(M) Wait up. /(F) Wait.}|


---

**Oberon:**
Hmm?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What exactly is your purpose, Oberon?|


---

**Oberon:**
To overthrow Morgan, of course. It's not really my part, but that's why I was summoned.

**Oberon:**
Hm, not because of the Human Order, or something along those lines? Ah, that's what you're asking about.

**Oberon:**
I didn't want to tell you...but I can't pretend that I want something great like what I just said.

**Oberon:**
&mdash;Yeah. I'm looking for Titania.

**Oberon:**
The one I told you about. Oberon's queen in “A Midsummer Night's Dream”.

**Oberon:**
Titania, the Fairy Queen. The only one who could love the eccentric Oberon.

**Oberon:**
If possible, I'd really like to meet her in person.

**Oberon:**
Though&mdash;it's probably a pipedream.

**Oberon:**
Titania is a fictional fairy. She doesn't exist in pan-human history.

**Oberon:**
Yeah, she was an existence permitted only within fiction. 

**--BATTLE--:**

**Artoria:**
Ow, ow ow ow...!

**Artoria:**
Come on! I said it was just a light spar, but Muramasa treated it so seriously!

**Senji Muramasa:**
That's because I'm old. I have to give the young'uns a hard time without any mercy.

**Senji Muramasa:**
It doesn't look like Fujimaru needs any more of a hard time though.

**Senji Muramasa:**
The unfolding of the battle in relation to simple summoning, that's very important.

**Senji Muramasa:**
It would be better for me to guard you than to go out into battle.

**Senji Muramasa:**
With the right strategy, you might even be able to beat a Fairy Knight!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A Fairy Knight....|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could you do it?


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, if I use everything I've got and expend all my magical energy, then I could!

**Senji Muramasa:**
They've beaten you to a pulp before, huh? Well, this time it's our turn.

**Senji Muramasa:**
As the strongest here, the Fairy Knights are not to be feared, I tell ya!

**Artoria:**
Mmh.

**Artoria:**
Muramasa, your weapons are made of iron, right? Could I have some of the materials?

**Senji Muramasa:**
No, sorry, but I'm the only one who can use these. Like, they've been paid for in advance with my magical energy.

**Senji Muramasa:**
If you want to use them, you'll have to prepare them from scratch by yourself.

**Senji Muramasa:**
If you want iron, the only way to get that is for you to head to the mines. Norwich is in charge of those, right?

**Artoria:**
I see... then I guess I'll have to find it elsewhere...

**Artoria:**
(I finally thought of a way to defeat Gawain, and yet...)

**Senji Muramasa:**
What, you look like you're scheming something. Want a hand with it?

**Artoria:**
I don't! Stick to Fujimaru, gramps!

**Senji Muramasa:**
&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
Artoria has entered her rebellious phase, hasn't she? Or is that just the way she's always been?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe, she's just a sore loser.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe, she doesn't like having Muramasa as her grandpa.


---

**Artoria:**
That's wrong, I'm just acting like the Child of Prophecy!

**Artoria:**
I'm the Child of Prophecy after all! So I'm going to be very serious from now on!

**Da Vinci:**
Serious from now on?

**Da Vinci:**
You've always been serious. There isn't anyone who thinks you haven't been.

**Da Vinci:**
Haha. Is this because of what Oberon said last night? How he said a direct confrontation with that Fairy Knight is inevitable.

**Artoria:**
That's right... but...

**Artoria:**
...I can't be lost forever.

**Artoria:**
I don't really get the feeling of being on a pilgrimage to save Britain or to ring the bells, but...

**Artoria:**
...Gloucester, and all the fairies we met along the way, are all expecting it to happen.

**Artoria:**
Even in the village where I was born, Tintagel, they all believed in me, and so they sent me on this journey.

**Artoria:**
I'm not sure if I can meet everyone's expectations, and that's what I worry about the most...

**Artoria:**
That's why! I thought I'd start off by proudly announcing “I am the Child of Prophecy!”

**Artoria:**
W-w-well, I just have the spirit of hit-or-miss, I don't have any concrete ideas...

**Senji Muramasa:**
What's up with that? You sound like a little girl who can't decide whether she's brave or cowardly.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Yeah, exactly.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I can't afford to lose my way either.)


---

**Artoria:**
Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I too, will partake regardless of Chaldea's mission.|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm here to help you, Artoria.|


---

**Artoria:**
B-but what about Mash!?

**Artoria:**
The only reason we're on the same team right now is because we're searching for Mash.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course we'll still look for Mash. That part is obvious.|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But on top of that, I want to help the Child of Prophecy too.|


---

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
I agree. We weren't clear on our position before.

**Da Vinci:**
Searching for Mash is our top priority, but that doesn't mean we leave Britain to fend for itself.

**Da Vinci:**
We're not working with you for Mash's sake, we're working with you for Britain's sake.

**Da Vinci:**
I want to leave this country with a smile after I've helped the friends I've made along the way, so I can be pleased with myself.

**Da Vinci:**
Isn't that what all of this is about, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Even though I'm sure the new Director will scold me.


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I agree! In the end, even Gordolf would say the same thing!

**Artoria:**
That means&mdash;not only Muramasa,

**Artoria:**
but Fujimaru and da Vinci, will also accompany me on my pilgrimage?

**Da Vinci:**
And of course, Oberon, who isn't here right now, as well. Our victory will be rewarded handsomely, after all☆

**Da Vinci:**
How about it, future King? If it bothers you, we can always part ways.

**Artoria:**
No&mdash;not at all! You're all welcomed! I would have never even dreamed of this!

**Artoria:**
The first alliance as the Child of Prophecy! Wow, somehow I actually seem like a king! Yay!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, you really seem like a king.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I'm glad you're so happy with this!)


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, even if we're excited, that doesn't change the fact that we don't know what to do.

**Senji Muramasa:**
It's good that you're motivated as the Child of Prophecy. But seriously, what are we supposed to do now?

**Artoria:**
Ghh, the reality of it makes me want to die...!

**Artoria:**
Let me be happy for now at least, just for this moment, Muramasaaaa!

**Senji Muramasa:**
No, as the oldest one here, I have to offer a different view, don't I?

**???:**
I've heard your conversation. Hm, if that is the case, I have a suggestion.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That voice&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oberon!


---

**Oberon?:**
The time has come earlier than expected. Now is the time to show the Child of Prophecy what she must do.

**Oberon?:**
This is where we must be headed. The fork in the road of destiny, the trial that will prove the rumors of the Child of Prophecy once and for all...

**Oberon?:**
Yes! It's time to go save Norwich!

**Artoria:**
I can hear your voice, but I can't see you at all!? Oberon, is that really you, Oberon!?

**Oberon?:**
Huh? What's with that reaction. Ah, I see. That's right.

**Oberon?:**
Everyone, down, below you. Look further down.

**Oberon:**
Phew. Long distance traveling is very tiresome. But I had to see the intel with my own eyes.

**Oberon:**
Hello, everyone, is it the first time you've seen me like this?

**Oberon:**
The miniature, dapper speedster, who travels around Britain on a Mach-speed Hawk-moth.

**Oberon:**
The Fairy King riding in the hand of Robin Goodfellow, Rider Oberon, that's me!

**Everyone else:**
You&mdash;

**Everyone else:**
You're so tiny!?

## Section 7: Fragment / 4 - Sheffield (II) 

**Narration:**
Military boots resounded across the northern lands, as the Queen's army continued their march forward.

**Narration:**
In amongst the vanguard of the army heading for Sheffield, the standard of “Black Flame and Fortress” was fluttering.

**Narration:**
Fairy Knight Gawain was advancing towards Sheffield.

**Narration:**
Her goal was neither to suppress the rebels, nor to negotiate with Boggart.

**Narration:**
Beryl Gut, who had joined them yesterday as the Queen's representative, gave a broad grin.

**Narration:**
It was just one day before the city of Sheffield would disappear from Britain.

**Mash:**
Lord Boggart, have you still not gotten any rest?

**Mash:**
I would like to ask if something is troubling you.

**Boggart:**
Hmph. You can't even pour me a drink? What a useless wife you are.

**Boggart:**
Well, either way, it's not as if I am familiar with the taste of alcohol. I don't really understand mankind's cuisine in general.

**Boggart:**
To exercise one's ingenuity, and go through the trouble of complicating the flavor of meat. To me, it is a meaningless waste of time.

**Boggart:**
The Fang Clan has no need for the likes of humans, let alone restaurants...

**Boggart:**
Haven't you heard? The city of Oxford is brimming with restaurants.

**Boggart:**
Everywhere you look, there's one of Woodwose's restaurants. Like a poor joke taken too far.

**Boggart:**
Imagine if all the shops on the main street of Sheffield were restaurants.

**Boggart:**
You would likely laugh out of sheer astonishment.

**Mash:**
It's....yes. It would be rather strange and laughable.

**Boggart:**
Indeed. It's nothing more than an amusing appearance. At some point, I will have to show you&mdash;

**Boggart:**
...No. Forget it. There's indeed something wrong with me.

**Boggart:**
“Child of Prophecy”. You exterminated Mors at the request of the townspeople.

**Boggart:**
Soldiers witnessed you fighting in that armor. This in spite of me telling you not to stand out.

**Mash:**
Yes. I apologize. I'm unfit to be Lord Boggart's bride.

**Boggart:**
That has always been the case, you fool.

**Boggart:**
You are capable of fighting the Mors, but you fear carrying a weapon.

**Boggart:**
You didn't come back for the “Iron Cylinder”.

**Boggart:**
I heard of it from the merchants. They found you with that “Iron Cylinder”.

**Boggart:**
But not once have you mentioned it. As if you want to forget about it.

**Boggart:**
That thing can rival Morgan's Holy Lance.

**Boggart:**
Why are you running from such power?

**Mash:**
I do not know. But that “Iron Cylinder” is going to make everyone....

**Mash:**
I have a feeling that it's going to hurt Britain itself... that is what frightens me.

**Boggart:**
No.... You aren't just scared of that “Cylinder”.

**Boggart:**
You fear battle itself&mdash;

**Boggart:**
No, never mind. I don't think I'll ever know what your true feelings are.

**Boggart:**
Only records and achievements shall be considered. Your memories from before coming here have yet to return, is that so?

**Boggart:**
Whether it's your calling or not, you are without a doubt a knight. You've known battle for a long time.

**Boggart:**
But I don't remember seeing you in the Queen's army, nor was the appointment of a new Fairy Knight ever mentioned.

**Boggart:**
I've never seen a fairy like you. Where did you come from?

**Boggart:**
Are you really...are you really the Child of the Prophecy who will save Britain?

**Boggart:**
If so, then your destination will be nothing other than a battlefield. The pilgrimage of “The Child of Prophecy” is built on a path of war and blood.

**Boggart:**
Would you be capable of such a feat? Not merely to overthrow the Queen, but to seize control and rule over all six clans by force?

**Mash:**
That's...that's...

**Boggart:**
Hmph, you couldn't. Even should your memory return, you are unfit for this.

**Boggart:**
Fairies live for the sake of their purpose. What will you do if it's something you do not want?

**Boggart:**
You are not the Child of Prophecy, after all. You are merely a mislead imitation, a lost child.

**Boggart:**
I have known battle for a long time. Ever since I was born, I have been fighting against the Mors.

**Boggart:**
The Fang Clan has fought Mors and suppressed them. They are the most powerful Clan in Britain.

**Boggart:**
Woodwose and I were the strongest of them all. I couldn't tell you how many times we saved Britain from the Mors.

**Boggart:**
For our service, Woodwose was made Lord of Oxford, and I of Norwich.

**Mash:**
So I've heard. Lord Boggart was the Lord of Norwich.

**Mash:**
But, what brought you to Sheffield?

**Boggart:**
I was done in by a man named Capless. He has since taken the name Spriggan.

**Boggart:**
No, enough talk about a low-lives like him. It is not for you to hear.

**Boggart:**
Do you know about the Caterpillar Wars of 200 years ago? The only war in which the Queen gave off a womanly shriek.

**Boggart:**
Fufu. How very unlike you to be afraid of insects, Morgan.

**Boggart:**
During that war, Morgan granted the knightly title of Gawain to ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■.

**Boggart:**
It is impossible to further recall her name, due to the Queen's True Name Redesignation.

**Boggart:**
Until Gawain is defeated, no one can utter her original fairy name.

**Boggart:**
Woodwose persecuted ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ for being the daughter of that abominable Black Dog, but I came to admire her strength.

**Boggart:**
In a sense...I am also somewhat responsible for that thing becoming a Fairy Knight.

**Boggart:**
“If you don't want to be called a dog, don't fight with your claws and fangs.”

**Boggart:**
“■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■. Child of noble blood. You shall fight with your sword—your great horn.”

**Boggart:**
She took a liking to my words, and has since carried her sword. Soon after, did the Queen recognize her as a knight.

**Boggart:**
She became a Fairy Knight, and volunteered herself to be the shield to protect the fairies from the Mors.

**Boggart:**
Perhaps because she herself was despised as the daughter of a Black Dog...

**Boggart:**
She came to understand the feelings of the weak and sought the responsibility of being strong.

**Boggart:**
The Queen referred to it as “noblesse oblige”. Good grief, I wasn't even aware of that part of human culture.

**Boggart:**
You remind me of ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ as a newborn.

**Boggart:**
Troubled about the fact you were born strong, hating yourself for having to exploit the weak.

**Boggart:**
That little girl's unseemly crying face.

**Mash:**
...You still cherish her, don't you? That person, Gawain.

**Boggart:**
Never! 200 years ago, when that thing became a Fairy Knight, I stopped thinking about her.

**Boggart:**
...No. What's up with me...

**Boggart:**
Something's wrong. This is not a matter of valor, but of personal history...

**Boggart:**
This was nothing but idle talk. Forget about tonight. Do not lay it on your mind. I'm returning to the war council.

**Mash:**
Yes. Take care, Lord Boggart. But, please, don't stay up too late.

**Boggart:**
&mdash;

**Boggart:**
I have wondered this for a while. Why are you not afraid of me?

**Mash:**
Most likely, it's because Sheffield is a beautiful city.

**Mash:**
I heard that Lord Boggart rebuilt this city from the ground up.

**Mash:**
Even though it is a fortified city, it is a bright and pleasant city that cherishes the fairies who live here.

**Mash:**
I don't think I could feel afraid going up against something like that.

**Boggart:**
...That's true. Compared to Norwich, Sheffield is indeed a beautiful place.

**Boggart:**
However, such things conclude today. From tomorrow onwards, the gates will be closed.

**Boggart:**
Morgan's army is drawing near. If it comes to battle... you will find it difficult to call it “a beautiful city” any longer.

**Mash:**
Lord Boggart, what was that...!?

**Boggart:**
It's a warning from the scouts. But it's early, way too early...! Hey, what the hell is going on?

**Boggart:**
Give me a status report!

**Boggart:**
Are you saying the Queen's army crossed the eastern Vein Corridor in just two days?!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Sir! The Queen's army is assembling at the front gate as we speak!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Also, a message was delivered a moment ago. Do you wish to read it?

**Boggart:**
Read it. Just the important parts. What does Morgan have to say?

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Ha, ha..... this is... ...it is...it is... ...that... ...

**Boggart:**
Report! Why are you hesitating?

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Yes, milord!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
“Deliver the Child of Prophecy to me. If you comply, I shall grant Sheffield its freedom,”

**Fairy Guardsman:**
...it says!

**Fairies:**
Deliver the Child of Prophecy.....Lady Mash? Why?

**Fairies:**
What about Norwich? Is this the solution to our return to Norwich?!

**Fairies:**
No, what do they mean by granting freedom in the first place? Do they not see Lord Boggart's expansion of armaments as a problem!?

**Boggart:**
&mdash;Gaaaaaaah!!!!

**Boggart:**
Whatever...!

**Boggart:**
You don't care about our rebellion, Morgan!

**Boggart:**
Your insults to the Fang Clan know no bounds&mdash;!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Message, message!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Scouts have identified the standard of the Queen's army!

**Fairy Guardsman:**
Gawain is at its front! The Fairy Knight Gawain!

**Boggart:**
Oh. So that's how it is.

**Boggart:**
My Queen. You were boastful in your letter, but your true intentions are showing in your command, aren't they?

**Boggart:**
Sending your right-hand, Gawain, proves that you fear our army.

**Boggart:**
As long as Knocknarea's army remains in the north, Sheffield cannot fall.

**Boggart:**
The Queen has chosen negotiation over subjugation. The army outside has no intention of fighting.

**Boggart:**
It's no wonder they marched so fast. They are not equipped for battle.

**Boggart:**
Now...will you return Norwich to us, or will you dispatch troops to purge the “Calamity Pool”?

**Boggart:**
Let us hear which one you will choose, O Queen of the Fairy Kingdom.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
...

**Fairy Guardsman:**
...and, another thing, Lord Boggart. The standard was not only that of Gawain.

**Fairy Guardsman:**
The enemy lines fly the standards of three knights. Tristan, Lancelot&mdash;

**Fairy Guardsman:**
The sighting of all three fairy knights has been confirmed! What sits at our door is the largest military force in Fairy Kingdom!

**Boggart:**
All of them are here&mdash;!?

**--ARROW--:**

**Gawain's Soldier:**
All the troops are in position. Is there anything else, Lord Gawain?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Stand by until the messenger we sent to Boggart returns. Tell Tristan's troops to do the same.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...And what about Lancelot?

**Morgan's Soldier:**
Lord Lancelot is waiting in the skies. She will descend on the castle when the battle begins.

**Morgan's Soldier:**
Since Her Majesty's orders were to not only cleanse Sheffield, but to annihilate Boggart's army,

**Morgan's Soldier:**
anyone in the castle, military and civilians alike, will be caught in Lord Lancelot's attack.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...I see. Either way, it's a bother for her to fall in line with us.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Tell Lancelot to descend on the back gate. That is where the Child of Prophecy will escape, should they attempt to do so.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...Boggart. If you surrender the city now, we can spare this forthcoming bloodshed. There will be no need to wield my horn in vain.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
This is the difference to our strength. If you are a man of reason, do not resist needlessly&mdash;

**Gawain's Soldier:**
Message, message!

**Gawain's Soldier:**
The messenger you sent to Sheffield has returned with a reply from Lord Boggart!

**Gawain's Soldier:**
“There is no Child of Prophecy within my castle. Only the flag of rebellion against the Queen resides here.”

**Gawain's Soldier:**
“This castle is my lifeblood. Only when my life returns to the earth will it have served its purpose.”

**Gawain's Soldier:**
That is all!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...The fool.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
First squad, second squad, switch to anti-fortress gear! Sheffield's walls are tough!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It may even surpass my “Foul Weather”! Be prepared to lose 20% of our men before taking the castle!

**Gawain's Soldier:**
Sir! Under Her Majesty the Queen, we are all willing to accept any fate!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Boggart...! You've got more ambition than you can handle...!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Did you really think Her Majesty would let Sheffield off easy, just to keep Knocknarea in check?

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Do not underestimate us! Even if you strike under the cover of Knocknarea, Camelot will not fall!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
If you misread the big picture like that, you do not have what it takes to stand as a leader!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You're an old soldier left behind by time, and I will drive you out with this horn of mine!

**Boggart:**
Gather our troops! Hold the siege!

**Boggart:**
Send an envoy to Knocknarea! We will hold for two days, and she will send reinforcements by then!

**Narration:**
Under Boggart's command, Sheffield's resistance began.

**Narration:**
“With three Fairy Knights instead of one, there's no hope for us! We should just hand over the Child of Prophecy!”

**Narration:**
Many people clamored to such thoughts, but in the end, Boggart curbed them all.

**Narration:**
No one knew for certain if he wanted to keep the Child of Prophecy safe, or to use her as his trump card.

**Narration:**
Regardless, it was the right decision. Had he offered up the Child of Prophecy,

**Narration:**
the fairies of Sheffield would have been slaughtered much sooner, and with much less mercy.

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
There's a report from the watchtower! It is as if the weapons of the Queen's army are on fire!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
One layer of the bark has already melted...! Despite being built by the Earth Clan with sturdy oak wood,

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
it won't last until morning! We need reinforcements as soon as possible...!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
We have to deal with the Queen's army climbing over the wall!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
Although there are not many of them, the enemy soldiers are highly trained. We will eventually be overrun!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
Our soldiers have put up a good fight. There's still no fighting inside the castle, but&mdash;

**Boggart:**
What!? Is Gawain engaging alone!?

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
It's an aerial assault by Fairy Knight Lancelot! She is destroying all of the barracks!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
It's no use, even the eyes of the Wind Clan cannot track her...! She's too fast, we can't shoot her down...!

**Boggart:**
I don't care if the barracks have been taken out! Drop her to the ground! Then I'll deal with her myself!

**Boggart:**
Lancelot may have the agility of a honey bee, but that is all she has going for her. Once she's on the ground, she will be no match for me.

**Boggart:**
What happened this time!? Did they fire a cannon at us!?

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
No, it's Gawain!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
She is standing in front of the main gate by herself, and she is swinging Galatine!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
The bark at the main gate only has 10 layers left! At this rate, the regrowth will not be able to keep up!

**Boggart:**
That little girl...! What is happening in the castle, what happened to the soldiers' formation!?

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
That's... The residents started panicking, and we cannot deploy the formation fully!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
Some fairies started demanding that the back gate be opened, and so a riot broke out&mdash;

**Boggart:**
The back gate shall not be opened! If even one person escapes outside, our collapse will start from there!

**Boggart:**
Guard Captain, you have defended the throne well, now take control of suppressing the riots!

**Guard of the Throne:**
Understood! Let's go, everyone!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
There is chaos both inside the walls and outside! If only the fighting was all in one place...!

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
Please give us orders, Lord Boggart! What should we do!?

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
You were the one who claimed that we could hold back the Queen's army when they attacked! Or should we offer up the Child of Prophecy now&mdash;!?

**Boggart:**
I know, I know! All we have to do is stop one of them!

**Boggart:**
We have a cannon powered by magecraft here! Let's test the power of the Child of Prophecy!

**Narration:**
Boggart, exasperated, ran to the “Iron Cylinder” attached to the castle's keep.

**Narration:**
Boggart himself did not think that this would change the tide of the battle.

**Narration:**
Nonetheless, he placed his finger on the trigger in the hopes that it would at least bring about a stalemate.

**Narration:**
This was the beginning of the end for Sheffield.

**Narration:**
The coup de grâce which turned the siege into a raze.

**--ARROW--:**

**Narration:**
The ray of light emitted from the castle's keep quite literally swept away the atmosphere of the battlefield.

**Narration:**
More than 600 of the Queen's soldiers, who had been attacking the main gate of the castle, vanished in an instant.

**Narration:**
Even the soldiers of Sheffield who had fought valiantly on the ramparts met their end, blood spurting from every orifice of their bodies.

**Narration:**
All the fairies in the vicinity of the trajectory of the blast had dropped dead, as if falling asleep.

**Narration:**
The castle walls, the same walls which withstood direct attacks from Galatine, had melted down into not even a shadow of their former selves.

**Narration:**
The Fairy Knight who had stood in front of the main gate was now nothing more than a hazy figure in the white smoke.

**Gawain's Soldier:**
Lord Gawain&mdash;Lord Gawain&mdash;

**Narration:**
For but a moment, fear ruled the battlefield. The morale of the Queen's army plummeted,

**Narration:**
and even the soldiers of Sheffield, who should have been crying out in jubilation, had the same peace of mind as if they were in the midst of a nightmare.

**Narration:**
Amidst the white smoke, a single shadow arose with the roar of a beast.

**Boggart:**
Ha&mdash;

**Boggart:**
Haha&mdash;

**Soldiers of Sheffield:**
Lord... Boggart... Lo... gart...

**Boggart:**
Haha, hahaha, hahahahahahaha!

**Boggart:**
What is this, what in the world is this!? Amazing, truly amazing!

**Boggart:**
Behold, soldiers! If this isn't a good blessing, then what is!?

**Boggart:**
We can win, we can win! With this Cylinder, even Fairy Knights are nothing to be feared!

**Boggart:**
No need to stop at Morgan! That fool Woodwose too!

**Boggart:**
And Knocknarea in the North! And that “Calamity Pool” that has fallen on Norwich!

**Boggart:**
We can exterminate them all, blow them all away! This is splendid, simply SPLENDID!!!!

**Narration:**
But Boggart did not notice. Although he saw it, he did not notice it.

**Narration:**
Not the anomaly of the Queen's soldiers, who lacked so much as a corpse. Not the soldiers who suffered and lost their lives on the castle walls.

**Narration:**
Not the fairies falling in the streets. Not even the soldiers falling like withered trees right beside him.

**Mash:**
Ah&mdash; Aah, ah&mdash;

**Narration:**
The Child of Prophecy fell to her knees, in despair of her sins.

**Narration:**
It wasn't just that she had hurt the people of the city she so loved.

**Narration:**
It's true that she had brought the Cylinder here.

**Narration:**
And she hadn't been able to stop Boggart, that was true as well.

**Narration:**
But her real sin, she thought, was her own weakness. In using her amnesia as an excuse,

**Narration:**
she never once stopped to think about the impact her actions would have on those around her; about the lack of foresight regarding the consequences of her presence here.

**Boggart:**
Next, who's next!? Lancelot, where are you flying to!?

**Boggart:**
Child of Prophecy, come over here! If you do it, you can surely fire this thing more accurately than I!

**Boggart:**
That blue bee is next! Drop her from the sky! Burn the entirety of the Queen's army to the ground, fwahahahaha!

**Narration:**
Unaware of the anomalies surrounding him, Boggart turned to look behind him.

**Narration:**
And there he saw,

**Mash:**
Why do I&mdash;

**Mash:**
have to hurt a world as beautiful as this...?

**Boggart:**
&mdash;

**Habetrot:**
Leave him here, we have to go, Mash! We cannot stay here with him, we have to escape!

**Mash:**
&mdash;B-but, to leave Lord Boggart alone,

**Boggart:**
&mdash;Tsk, I don't need you! You were always too soft at heart!

**Boggart:**
A queen who cries in battle will only get in my way! Take her wherever!

**Habetrot:**
See what I mean! Boggart has already set his mind on killing all his enemies!

**Habetrot:**
Even if you stay here, nothing will change! What do you want to do here!? What CAN you do here!?

**Mash:**
Outside...! We have to help everyone in this city!

**Habetrot:**
Ok, let's get going! I had planned to run, but I'll go with you!

**Habetrot:**
Goodbye, Boggart! For all the work I have done for you, I will take this bride as payment!

**Mash:**
Oh, and&mdash;please stay safe, Boggart!

**Gawain's Soldier:**
Aah...Lord Gawain! I can't believe you're alive!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Hah? You can't believe...? Oh, the bullet of light just now.

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It was nothing more than hot light filled with magical energy! It tinged with poisonous iron, but there was nothing more to it!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It had no skill, no conviction! It was nothing compared to a strike from Her Majesty Morgan!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Resume the advance, you weaklings! You are still the elites of Camelot!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Boggart has, in his foolishness, destroyed his own strongest line of defense!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Go through that fool's front gate and capture the castle!

**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
We need not pursue those who fled. The priority is for the castle of Sheffield to fall!

**Narration:**
As the Queen's army passed through the front gate, the soldiers of Sheffield fought back.

**Narration:**
Those holed up in their homes, clasping each other's hands, had no choice but to surrender to the Queen's army breaking through their doors.

**Narration:**
Seeing the fall of the front gate, those who were able rushed to the back gate in order to escape.

**Narration:**
Fairy Knight Gawain did not move from the front gate, and instead gazed up at the tower of the castle one kilometer away.

**Narration:**
As if to tell Boggart, whose mind had been transfixed by the destructive force of the Cylinder: “Aim here.”

**Boggart:**
You think you stand a chance against me...! You think you can bait me, little girl?

**Boggart:**
Damn you, knight of Morgan! Next time, you shall not endure!

**Narration:**
Boggart, in all his excitement, had not even noticed that the poison from the “Cylinder” was felling him as well.

**Narration:**
All that remained to him in this moment was hostility towards the blasted Fairy Knight Gawain, and his admiration for ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■'s excellent leadership.

**Boggart:**
Hu...that little girl, how dare she&mdash;

**Narration:**
Boggart's mouth hung agape at the thought of her having become such an impressive knight.

**Narration:**
At the same time, what came to his mind was the tears he had seen before.

**Boggart:**
&mdash;

**Narration:**
For the first time on this battlefield, he stopped to wonder “why?”

**Narration:**
Why had that girl cried? Why had she been so distraught?

**Narration:**
There was nothing to be distraught about. For in the end, Boggart would never come to understand the sensitivity of that girl.

**Boggart:**
No, this is a battlefield! What are you confused about!? Weapons are to be used, and enemies are to be defeated!

**Boggart:**
Sheffield is mine...! It will not relinquish even one of my people as long as I live!

**Narration:**
There was a thinly veiled sense that his anger was not directed at the Fairy Knight, but at his own inadequacy.

**Narration:**
Fingertips beginning to numb, Boggart placed his finger on the trigger one final time.

**Mash:**
It seems the inside of the castle is still safe. Is it possible to evacuate everyone from the streets into here!?

**Habetrot:**
It's possible, but there would be nowhere to run if we had to! We'd either be caught or killed!

**Habetrot:**
If we want to save as many people as possible, we should open the rear gate and secure an escape route!

**Habetrot:**
Sheffield will fall faster, but it will whether we do this or not, so who cares!

**Habetrot:**
Whether it's to be captured and killed by the Queen's army, or to flee to the north and become one of Knocknarea's slaves,

**Habetrot:**
to disappear into the fields, or to escape into the realm of a Fairy Deadlord!

**Habetrot:**
You should at least have the freedom to choose for yourself! Let's go to the back gate, Mash!

**Habetrot:**
But if we run into a Fairy Knight, we'll run away, okay? Those guys are only after you, Mash!

**Mash:**
Yes...! I'm coming, Habetrot!

**Sheffield Fairy:**
Quickly, quickly, open the gates! The Queen's army is coming!

**Sheffield Fairy:**
If we get caught, won't we get taxed!?

**Sheffield Fairy:**
I don't have that much life force left, so if they do that, I'll die!

**Sheffield Guard:**
Calm down, even if we open the gate, the situation won't change! You can't get out of this place!

**Sheffield Guard:**
Go back to your homes, go back! Lord Boggart will drive away the Queen's army in no time!

**Sheffield Guard:**
Hold on until then! If you are without a home, head to the castle!

**Sheffield Guard:**
We have to get to the front gate, we can't afford to lose time here...!

**Sheffield Fairy:**
It's no use! Flames are raining from the sky...! If we stay in the house, we'll only burn to death!

**Sheffield Fairy:**
Isn't the inside of the castle already packed with the Queen's soldiers?

**Sheffield Fairy:**
We have to run outside, Knocknarea's army will be arriving soon, right!?

**Sheffield Fairy:**
They'll definitely help us! After all, we're with the king!

**Sheffield Fairy:**
Just get out of here, there's nothing to be gained by staying here!

**Sheffield Fairy:**
There's no way we can rely on Boggart! He's been a loser from the Fang Clan from the very beginning!

**Sheffield Fairies:**
That's right, that's right! Lord Boggart has failed! Even though he was the ruler of this territory, he was weak!

**Sheffield Fairies:**
It's 2,000 years too early for him to be pointing his blades at the Queen!

**Sheffield Guard:**
You&mdash;!

**Rob:**
Aah, what the hell! It feels like this place is about to explode at any minute!

**Rob:**
It seems like there's going to be in-fighting here before the Queen's army can even capture us.

**Rob:**
We can't even get any help from the guards, it seems. I get it, but...

**Rob:**
Come on, this way's blocked too! Master Boggart was way too thorough with this.

**Rob:**
Wag, how are those sewers? You think we can get through there?

**Wag:**
No use, the walls extend down here too! Even if it's to prevent invasion, this is just too much!

**Rob:**
This is really bad, there's really no way to escape. Wag, have you checked how to get the rear gate open?

**Wag:**
Of course I did! I overheard the guards like you said I would, brother!

**Wag:**
The two of us could probably handle it. On both sides of the gate, in the left and right guardrooms,

**Wag:**
there are levers behind the third pillar with a vine pattern on it. If we flip those, we're good.

**Wag:**
Oh, but don't step on the picket of the scaffolding below the lever. They say that it's a safety device that renders the lever useless.

**Rob:**
If you know this much, then you're good to go. Good job, Wag. You'll be able to finish the job by yourself now.

**Wag:**
Hehehe, is that so? Is that so!?

**Wag:**
I wonder if I'll be able to do everything by myself like Winky!

**Rob:**
Oh, we'll see, we'll see. Think about it more when I get caught.

**Rob:**
Well then, let's grab the guards' attention and get that gate opened.

**Rob:**
The fairies in Sheffield have treated me to a lot of drinks.

**Rob:**
This is the least I can do for them&mdash;Damn, it's the Queen's army! They're already here!

**Rob:**
Forget about opening the gate, Wag. Let's hide in here and see what happens!

**Rob:**
We were a little too late, whatever we do now won't go well! Hell is gonna break out all around us!

**Wag:**
Huuh!? B-b-but, all we have to do is open the gate, right!?

**Rob:**
Idiot, I've taught you to not do more than you're supposed to.

**Rob:**
What's the most valuable thing in this world? Your own life, right?

**Rob:**
Then you have to take great care of it. If it's worth the most, you have get the most out of it, right?

**Wag:**
I see. That's right. It's not good to barely get any use of something that's very precious.

**Wag:**
Then let's wait a little longer in here, in these sewers&mdash; Brother, over there!

**Wag:**
The Queen's soldiers are being blown away! That's&mdash; that's Annis, brother!

**Wag:**
Annis came to help!

**Rob:**
I told you, she's Mash now! But well, this changes things!

**Rob:**
Let's sneak into the guardroom now, while Mash has the attention of both the Queen's soldiers and the guards!

**Wag:**
Phew, she did it! That's our Mash, our Child of Prophecy!

**Narration:**
Fairies streamed to the back gate, as the Queen's army rushed to capture them.

**Narration:**
The guards stepped forward to intercept the army, but the escaping citizens blocked their way, rendering them unable to do so.

**Narration:**
The Queen's soldiers swung their blades on the fairies struggling to escape their inevitable death through the gate.

**Narration:**
Once the blood began flowing, it would not cease.

**Narration:**
The fairies were gripped with fear as the soldiers dealt with them, in a way befitting insurgents.

**Narration:**
The back gate had become an ocean of blood. Not a single person could escape.

**Narration:**
Of course, there was no way she would let such a thing come to pass.

**Mash:**
Haaaaaaah!!!!!

**I：Sheffield Guard:**
Lady Mash!? Why are you here!?

**Mash:**
I'm here to assist! Lute, can you open the back gate!?

**I：Sheffield Guard:**
O-on my own accord...! But, yes, I will!

**I：Sheffield Guard:**
If the Lord's consort, Lady Mash, is passing through, there's no other option but to open it!

**Mash:**
Yes...! Thank you so much!

**I：Sheffield Guard:**
Think nothing of it.

**I：Sheffield Guard:**
...I'm about to do something I will regret. I've failed my job as a guard.

**I：Sheffield Guard:**
I'm opening the gate, someone come help me! Hurry! Don't let the Queen's army proceed past the guardroom!

**I：Sheffield Guard:**
Don't let anyone touch the safety device! If you see anyone suspicious, go ahead and cut them down!

**Queen's Soldier:**
We have sighted the fairy who is suspected of being the Child of Prophecy. She must be dealt with here.

**Queen's Soldier:**
Four of you, come with me. The rest stay here and finish off the citizens.

**Queen's Soldier:**
Do not let anyone who dares defy the Queen escape.

**Mash:**
Ha&mdash;! I am your opponent!

**Mash:**
Shed any further blood, and I will respond in kind.

**Mash:**
I am the Knight of Sheffield, Fairy Knight Galahad!

**Mash:**
I am your enemy, and I will be the one to defeat you...!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Sheffield Fairy:**
The gate has been opened! The Child of Prophecy has opened the gate!

**Sheffield Fairy:**
I don't see the Queen's army outside! Hurry up, hurry! We can take this chance to escape!

**Habetrot:**
Alright, we're done here! We should escape too, Mash!

**Habetrot:**
Leave Boggart to fend for the city.

**Habetrot:**
He may be a brute, but he's still an actual knight. If he planned to rebel, I'm sure he was prepared to be defeated.

**Habetrot:**
You don't have to stand with him. This is his final battle, and his alone.

**Mash:**
...Habetrot!

**???:**
...escaping is prohibited.

**???:**
...death by the noose, or death here. The choice is yours to make.

**Sheffield Fairy:**
La, la&mdash;

**Sheffield Fairy:**
Lancelot! It's Fairy Knight Lancelot!

**Sheffield Fairy:**
Ee, eeeek! I'm going to be killed, I'm going to be killed!

**Habetrot:**
Wha&mdash; What's that? Fairy...? Fairy Knight? THAT thing?

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...Sighting of the Child of Prophecy, confirmed. I was hoping it would not fall to me, but I have no choice. She must be captured.

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...more importantly. What did you say just now?

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Galahad, was it... That's a grand statement for a nobody.

**Habetrot:**
This is bad, she's coming for us. You have to give it everything you've got, Mash!

**Habetrot:**
And yeah, why did you call yourself Galahad anyways!?

**Habetrot:**
Just who is that even, what kind of sugar daddy are you keeping on the side, you...!

**Mash:**
N-no, I don't know either, I was just spurred on by the heat of the moment...!

**Mash:**
Never mind that, I will fight back! Everyone, please escape...!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Ugh-ghhhhh...!!!

**Mash:**
I can't...stand up to...even one of them...my powers are... already...

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...I see. I figured you would would endure a little, but&mdash;that shield...

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Relying on the protection of the Round Table is without sense. Such Mystery is completely different.

**Sheffield Guard:**
Shit! That explosion just now was from the castle tower&mdash;did something happen to Lord Boggart!?

**Habetrot:**
(Aha! It's nice to see you're not giving up, but that face! Oh come off it, don't tell me you're planning to save him&mdash;!?)

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...you have regained your strength, then. A stubborn one, aren't you?

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Is it simply for the fact that you call yourself Galahad?

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But you can't, Child of Prophecy. This is the end for you.

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You cannot leave here. There is no need for two Children of Prophecy.

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Farewell. You were far too hasty to name yourself a Fairy Knight, and to falsely assume the name of Galahad.

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;Who's there?

**???:**
Sorry, but that young lady is my acquaintance.

**???:**
I didn't want to involve myself, but it'd be no good for her to die here.

**???:**
Stand down, Lancelot. That way, we can both return to our lives before long.

**Mash:**
Are you&mdash;are you perhaps the wolf who's been watching over me constantly...?

**???:**
Come on, does something so obvious really need to be said?

**???:**
I guess you have good intuition, or rather, good discernment as always, young lady.

**???:**
Leave this one to me and run. I can at least buy you some time.

**Mash:**
Y-yes, I'll take your word for it! Thank you very much, robed man!

**???:**
Huh, you're not going outside!? What are you doing, heading back into the castle!? Heeeeeyyyy!?

**Habetrot:**
I knew it...

**Habetrot:**
But it can't be helped, that's just how Mash is!

**Habetrot:**
Grimm! You're Grimm, right! Sorry it's been so long, but I'm looking forward to working together again!

**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah, leave it to me. Though, if my enemy is her, there's no way I'd end up surviving!

**Grimm the Wise:**
Nevertheless, I ask of you, will you be my enemy? I'll at least fight you with the determination to drive you out of this castle.

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...Grimm. So, you are Grimm the Wise...

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
A familiar of the savior who once lived during the Fairy Calendar. Now a Servant summoned in the Queen's Calendar, seemingly not having learned his lesson.

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Her Majesty the Queen has given me leave to handle you... Out of curiosity, do you have any last words?

**Grimm the Wise:**
It'd take too long to tell. Well, we're both outsiders in this Fairy Kingdom,

**Grimm the Wise:**
so let's not worry about our surroundings, and fight to our heart's desire!

**--ARROW--:**

**???:**
Huuuh, he deflected that one too. It seems true then, that he's as hardy as Gawain.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
But hooooow sad ♡ I'm not interested in the hardness of his hide.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I want to touch his throbbing muscles, and scrape out his rumbling knotty intestines.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Look, your insides are a disarranged and suffering mess! I'm gonna make you look like an unsellable doll!

**Boggart:**
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/NkGVSh6.png#gh-light-mode-only)&ndash;!

**Beryl:**
Uh-oh, careful with that, Lady. You're making blood splatter all over us.

**Beryl:**
I'm about to reunite with a very dear friend of mine. I can't have my only good suit getting stained.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
What are you talking about? You were already covered in blood.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
But hey, better yet, look, Beryl, how miserable Boggart is.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
A spell that reflects the soul to create a projection... Look, look, it works just as I imagined!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Bend your arms ~ ♪ Bend your legs ~ ♪

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
He's just like some ugly marionette! This magecraft you taught me is too much fun!

**Boggart:**
Agh&mdash;, agh, ah&mdash;!

**Beryl:**
Yeah, they call it Fetch!

**Beryl:**
I couldn't use it, because it was a little too advanced for me, but it is no problem for a fairy such as you.

**Beryl:**
It's quite the perfect match, actually! Well, I didn't imagine you would become so addicted to it!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's called Fetch, oh~~! I've decided, I will use this as my Noble Phantasm!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I'm going to use you as my plaything from now on, but you won't know what is happening.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
You'll be in my hands, but won't know what they're doing to you.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Aaah&mdash; this is the best!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Shake your head from side to side, put your hands together in prayer! There is no better way for a fool to die!

**Boggart:**
....Screw you...Tris....tan...you sow, as if&mdash; I&mdash;.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Shut it. Just die already. How are you still alive even after I dismantled your heart, damn it?

**Beryl:**
Hold on, it's still too early for that. Stay calm. Please, Lady.

**Beryl:**
Boggart still has to be useful one last time. He just has to stay alive a little longer...until...

**Beryl:**
Speak of the devil, here she comes. Good. She really did love you, didn't she, my lord?

**Mash:**
Are you all right, Boggart?

**Boggart:**
&mdash;wh...y?&mdash;

**Habetrot:**
Wait, Mash, slow down for a secon&mdash; Woah, what's that!?

**Habetrot:**
Boggart is all bloody and floating in the air! The ones on the throne, is this their doing!?

**Mash:**
...guh. We're here to help now, please hold on...!

**Beryl:**
Hooooooold it right there. If you move even an inch, Lord Boggart dies, okay?

**Beryl:**
You came to help, right? Then let's be friendly, and talk it out first.

**Beryl:**
Isn't that right, Mash? You're not a belligerent woman, are you?

**Mash:**
You're&mdash;

**Mash:**
...someone I know. But my memory...

**Beryl:**
Ah, I get it, I get it. Lost your memory, have you?

**Beryl:**
What was it...Mikey? Minky? No, Funky?

**Beryl:**
I got all the details from a guy with a name like that.

**Beryl:**
But what a disaster, Mash! I can't even begin to imagine your troubles.

**Beryl:**
Struggling so much in such a strange land! I, Beryl Gut, have come for you!

**Beryl:**
I know everything about your past! Now, let's go to New Darlington together!

**Beryl:**
We'll have lots of fun conversations there, just like old times, won't we?

**Habetrot:**
...Mash. This guy's no good. Lancelot was a troublesome opponent because she was so strong, but...

**Habetrot:**
Whether he's strong or weak, this guy's bad. The stench of blood permeates his soul.

**Mash:**
...I agree with you. Even if he seems like someone I know...

**Mash:**
We can't take his words for granted. That much we can be sure of.

**Beryl:**
Oh, come now, Mash. What, you lost your memory and became peevish?

**Beryl:**
Ah I see, it was was the poor nature of the fairies you kept company with, wasn't it?

**Beryl:**
You're right. If I'd been around filthy bandits, I would be very suspicious too.

**Beryl:**
But rest assured, I've always been your...

**Mash:**
What happened to the fairy who told you about me?

**Mash:**
&mdash;Tell me, where is Winky now?

**Beryl:**
&mdash;I can't tell you that.

**Beryl:**
After all, I don't know where dead people go when they die, nor do I really care to find out.

**Mash:**
You&mdash;!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Hey! Don't you dare move another step!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
No way!

**Beryl:**
Oh...!

**Beryl:**
H-how cruel, huh&mdash; I've never seen such a fierce romantic gesture&mdash;

**Beryl:**
Scary, scary. At this rate, we'll be chopped to pieces.

**Beryl:**
To be honest, neither I nor the Fairy Knight over there are any match for you right now.

**Beryl:**
After all, you are the Fairy Knight who took the name of Galahad, the greatest of the Knights of the Round Table, the Knight of Heaven.

**Beryl:**
Why, in that case we have no choice but use dirty tricks. If you will, Tristan.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Leave it to me. Are you sure this is what you want?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Look, I'm going to lead your beloved Lord Boggart over this wall. If I release the string, he will fall head first to the ground.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Falling from this height would be nothing for him normally, but this guy's been beaten to death's door.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It will be the finishing blow for him.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
So, how long will you be courting my man for?

**Beryl:**
Bless you, Lady Spinel!

**Beryl:**
How did you even know what I wanted you to do? You're a genius!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Of course I understand you, it's you and I! I know exactly where this is going!

**Mash:**
...What on earth is your goal here?

**Mash:**
You haven't come to capture the Child of Prophecy... to capture me, have you?

**Beryl:**
No, to be honest, I came here to kill the Child of Prophecy.

**Beryl:**
But well, the situation is a bit tricky. It looks like we're in a tough spot.

**Beryl:**
We're no match for you.

**Beryl:**
You won't forgive us for hurting Boggart.

**Beryl:**
Frankly, if Boggart dies here, we'll die next.

**Beryl:**
We couldn't stop you if you flew into a rage.

**Mash:**
...That's right. I'm not sure you could either.

**Beryl:**
Right, then! Let's do a bit of gambling!

**Beryl:**
I'll share a secret with you. I am Morgan's Master.

**Beryl:**
Ah, you don't understand the meaning of Master. Well, think of it like I'm Morgan's husband.

**Beryl:**
If you kill me, Morgan's army and power alike will be halved.

**Beryl:**
As the Child of Prophecy, you can't possibly pass up on this opportunity.

**Beryl:**
As I said before, even the two of us are no match for you.

**Beryl:**
It's a shame I set all this up to bring you here, because if it comes down to a fight between us, all will be lost.

**Beryl:**
Unless there was some sort of... hindrance, I guess?

**Mash:**
You're asking me to let you escape in exchange for saving Boggart?

**Mash:**
You want me to choose one or the other.

**Beryl:**
No, there'll be no need for you to choose, will there?

**Narration:**
The thread that held Boggart in the air snapped.

**Narration:**
Beryl Gut knew her all too well.

**Narration:**
He knew full well that she would not hesitate to jump after Boggart to save him.

**Mash:**
Boggart...!

**Beryl:**
You see? No matter what's going on inside her head, her reaction will be the same regardless.

**Beryl:**
Whether she lost her memory or not, it doesn't matter!

**Narration:**
Beryl Gut's laughter echoed through the air. After laughing for a while at her do-or-die rescue...

**Beryl:**
Now then, let's retrieve the Black Barrel&mdash; where would it be&mdash;

**Beryl:**
Hey, Lady. The cannon that was up there until a little while ago. Big thing, three meters long.

**Beryl:**
Where'd it go? Did it maybe just...fall down? Seriously?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Eh...sorry, I didn't see it. I was busy daydreaming about you, so...

**Beryl:**
Ahhh...

**Beryl:**
Well, nothing can be done about it! It's all right. Not a big deal!

**Beryl:**
So we've had enough fun. Let's go home, Lady Spinel.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Huh? Is it alright to leave the Mash girl alone? You wanted her so badly.

**Beryl:**
Yeah. Morgan told us not get into a fight with the Child of Prophecy, right?

**Beryl:**
In the first place, everyone but Lancelot had the tables turned on them. I'll have to think for a little longer on how to get my hands on her.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
...That's right. She's stronger than me...

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
What's with that, that's so boring. She was so cocky, I wanted to mess her up.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I'm so stressed, I feel like I'm going to die. May I go and butcher the fairies here?

**Beryl:**
Come now, it's better to just change the way you do things.

**Beryl:**
I told you, didn't I? If you can't hurt them on the outside, then let them rot from the inside.

**Beryl:**
As the Child of Prophecy, she will help others to her heart's content.

**Beryl:**
What awaits her at the end is a guilty conscience.

**Beryl:**
The more she acts the part of the Child of Prophecy, the more she'll despair at the end of it all.

**Beryl:**
After all, that's the foundation on which this Fairy Kingdom was built, right?

**--ARROW--:**

**Narration:**
She fell for a few seconds from the throne room, down into the castle courtyard.

**Narration:**
She sprung down the castle wall, taking Boggart's dying body in her arms, and fell to the ground on her back.

**Mash:**
Guh...ah&mdash;

**Narration:**
She had moved to protect the dying Boggart, but his weight had been added to hers,

**Narration:**
and as expected, she had become dizzy from the impact.

**Mash:**
No, this is...nothing&mdash;! But Boggart, are you safe?

**Boggart:**
&mdash;guh&mdash;

**Boggart:**
I'm alright. Come...now, it's only the second time I've fallen from this height.

**Narration:**
Despite his gasping for air, Boggart's harsh tone remained.

**Narration:**
The girl was relieved, but that relief was short-lived.

**Narration:**
Boggart's body was cold as the stone around him, his breath short and sharp.

**Mash:**
We'll get you medical care soon...but, all the people in the castle...

**Boggart:**
No matter. There are no more medics.

**Boggart:**
I could hear the clashing of swords. The sound of fires. The soldiers screaming as they fought.

**Boggart:**
...So that's it. They even took the castle?

**Mash:**
Yes...by the time I returned to the castle, it was already lost.

**Boggart:**
You...why...

**Boggart:**
...No...it's all right.

**Boggart:**
Take me to the rear gate. You returned to assist me, so will you do that?

**Mash:**
Yes. Ah, no, Habetrot hasn't...

**Habetrot:**
I'm right here~! What were you thinking, jumping off the castle walls like that!

**Habetrot:**
Thankfully, it turned out to be the fastest escape route.

**Mash:**
Thank goodness...! As one would expect of you, Habenyan, you're light and nimble!

**Habetrot:**
That's right! My spinning machine can even fly for a while! It's got all the bells and whistles you'd expect!

**Habetrot:**
But you're not allowed to call me Habenyan! That would make me the happiest of all!

**Mash:**
Right.

**Mash:**
Now then, I will escort Boggart to the rear gate! Habetrot, can you cover us?

**Narration:**
“Of course,” Habetrot replied with a nod.

**Narration:**
All the while, the girl tried her best to hold Boggart's large frame in her arms.

**Narration:**
She came to the realization that the magical energy which had overwhelmed her earlier had now dissipated.

**Narration:**
With her fight against Lancelot, and the fall just now, she had long since reached her limit.

**Boggart:**
You fool. You might be a Fairy Knight, but you are still part human.

**Mash:**
You mustn't, Boggart! You cannot carry me with that body of yours...!

**Mash:**
I can walk on my own, so just set me down!

**Boggart:**
If you don't even have the strength to remove my grip on your body, you will not convince me of such a thing.

**Boggart:**
The rear gate is this way. Let's go.

**Narration:**
Boggart lifted her aloft in his arms and, with his body covered in blood, began his stride.

**Narration:**
Laboriously, painstakingly, but as steadily and earnest as a groom running away with his bride in his arms.

**Habetrot:**
Woah, it's even worse than before!

**Habetrot:**
This is bad, Boggart. The rear gate is crowded with fairies! If we approach now, the Queen's soldiers are sure to spot us!

**Narration:**
Until this moment, Habetrot had managed to lead them past the Queen's army undetected.

**Narration:**
But such good fortune was drawing to a close.

**Narration:**
Once they entered the street leading to the gate, the Child of Prophecy and Boggart alike would be seen by everyone.

**Boggart:**
Indeed... It is quite fortuitous that the gates are open, but this...hmm?

**Boggart:**
...No, we will exit from that gate. If we stay here, we're sure to be found out.

**Boggart:**
With your help, some of my strength has returned. We will run from here.

**Boggart:**
I will also have to lead the people who are still confused about whether they should stay in the city or escape.

**Boggart:**
Child of Prophecy. You stand out. Keep your head down until we're outside.

**Mash:**
...? Y-yes, I understand.

**Boggart:**
...Alright, let's get going.

**Boggart:**
<span style=font-size:25px>Why are you dawdling, you fools!? </span>

**Boggart:**
The castle has fallen, the fighting in the main street has come to an end! The Queen's soldiers are coming this way!

**Boggart:**
Escape through the back gate into the twisting cave of Thistle Hill! If you are a citizen of Sheffield, you know what this means, don't you?

**Sheffield Fairies:**
Lord Boggart! You're alive!?

**Sheffield Fairies:**
B-but, the twisting cave of Thistle Hill is a place of no return. That's where the Fairy Deadlord...

**Boggart:**
I will be going. Should you have other plans in mind, do as you please. But you cannot stay here.

**Boggart:**
Hear them now, their footsteps! The largest body of the Queen's army, Gawain's Black Dog squad, approaches!

**Sheffield Fairies:**
Damn it!

**Narration:**
At Boggart's command, the fairies all rushed out of the rear gate, one after the other.

**Narration:**
Boggart held the girl, as if to relieve the fairies' confusion.

**Narration:**
And then he himself slowly marched through the gate.

**Habetrot:**
You did great, Boggart. But what will we do if they make it outside?

**Habetrot:**
Look behind you, the Queen's army is chasing after us!

**Habetrot:**
As long as the gates remain open, they will soon catch up to the people&mdash;huh?

**Habetrot:**
The gates are closing... What a contraption, Boggart.

**Habetrot:**
It's designed to close after you walk through it?

**Boggart:**
...It seems so...once again, we have been blessed with good fortune.

**Mash:**
Huh?

**Narration:**
There was a tone of anguish to Boggart's voice. Through it, you could sense that something was not right.

**Narration:**
She raised her head with all her might, and faced the now distant gate.

**Mash:**
&mdash;

**Mash:**
Wait. Please wait! Wait...! Aah...aah...!

**Mash:**
G&mdash;...G&mdash;.

**Mash:**
Good&mdash;Goodbye, goodbye!

**Mash:**
Thank you for...for saving me that day...!

**Mash:**
Thank you for granting me a name...! Thank you for always making me smile...!

**Narration:**
With Boggart still holding her in his arms where they stood,

**Narration:**
she frantically waved toward the two brothers, thanking them with the most genuine smile she could muster.

**Rob:**
Master Boggart, he's alive! Is that Mash?

**Rob:**
So they got there in time to help him...in this situation, we should do something to help, as well...

**Rob:**
...but...this...

**Wag:**
How awful, Mash's face is so pale! I can see it all the way from here!

**Wag:**
I bet Lancelot got to her, and that's why Boggart is supporting her!

**Wag:**
But what a relief that they're able to run away!

**Wag:**
We should go too, bro! We could travel with Mash once again!

**Rob:**
......Right. That wouldn't be so bad.

**Rob:**
I bet we could even get Master Boggart to join us. He'd be a great bodyguard.

**Rob:**
And if he was there, things would be a lot easier for Mash. Hehe, Winky might object to that, though.

**Rob:**
But you know, before we do that, there's something else we have to take care of.

**Wag:**
Huh? What could that possibly be? What could be so important right now?

**Rob:**
Yeah, someone's gotta do it. I can't do this alone.

**Rob:**
Wag, I can't do this without you.

**Wag:**
Brother? What's with that scary face?

**Wag:**
Come on, tell me. We're brothers, aren't we? If there's something you want to do, I'll help you.

**Rob:**
Oh, right, right. Well then, let's go close that gate.

**Rob:**
We overheard how to do it earlier, so it should be easy.

**Rob:**
We lower the lever to close the gate, and trigger the safety mechanism so that it can't open again.

**Rob:**
That should be enough. The Queen's army won't be able to get outside for a while.

**Wag:**
Haaah!? Bro, what are you saying?

**Wag:**
&mdash;

**Wag:**
&mdash;Alright. I see, I see. Alright, brother! Let's do it!

**Wag:**
But we can at least say goodbye first, right? I wouldn't want to worry Mash!

**Rob:**
Sure. We'll have to break into the guardroom either way, so let's go to the top of the stairs and escape to the top of the gate.

**Rob:**
And then...alright, alright, Master Boggart has his eyes on us.

**Rob:**
He's a real stickler for detail, he is. I'm sure he's guessed the plan.

**Boggart:**
<span style=font-size:25px>Why are you dawdling, you fools!? </span>

**Narration:**
Boggart's sturdy voice resounded throughout the square.

**Narration:**
It gathered the attention of the confused fairies, but at the same time, it called the attention of the Queen's army.

**Rob:**
Well then, let's go, Wag. This is the first time I've been this excited since we came to the Fairy Kingdom.

**Wag:**
Yeah, you're right, bro! We've made people angry, been scolded, hated...

**Wag:**
We've been through a lot, but in the end, I'm glad we ended up here!

**Narration:**
And so the gate shut.

**Narration:**
The Queen's soldiers were, of course, furious.

**Narration:**
When they found the two fairies hiding in the guardroom, they would slash them without end to try and drive them out.

**Narration:**
Outside they could see Boggart moving away, and in his arms, the face of the girl who turned to face them.

**Wag:**
Look, brother, Mash spotted us! She's looking right here!

**Wag:**
Heey, heey! I'm glad you're okay! Take caaaaaare!

**Wag:**
I'm too much of an idiot to make myself clear but... Thank you for everything, I mean it!

**Wag:**
Thank you for saving our lives!

**Narration:**
Rob looked on sorrowfully, yet pridefully, as his younger brother waved and gestured.

**Narration:**
The sound of military boots echoed downstairs. Soon, their journey would meet its end.

**Rob:**
...Hey, it isn't all bad. When you put your life on the line for something, you know you're doing it for what matters the most.

**Rob:**
Aah, screw it, I'm waving too! I don't give a shit about the Queen's men!

**Rob:**
So long, and good luck, Mash!

**Rob:**
Don't worry about us, we've already gotten our payment!

**Rob:**
Despite the prophecy, you saved us, you whimsical knight!

**Rob:**
It was a great journey! My most cherished memory, I'll never forget it for as long as I live!

**Narration:**
Following this, some soldiers gave chase, but Boggart and his people were able to escape undetected.

**Narration:**
This is how the battle of Sheffield came to its end.

**Narration:**
Above that rear gate, the voices of those two fairies, seeing their friend off until the very end, lived on forever and ever.

**--ARROW--:**

**Narration:**
The fairies who escaped from Sheffield were in a certain cave in the north.

**Narration:**
The twisted cave in Thistle Hill. An evil cave inhabited by a lone Fairy Deadlord.

**Narration:**
Boggart had prepared this place for use as an emergency shelter.

**Narration:**
The Fairy Deadlord had been done in by Boggart, and it was now a sanctuary.

**Narration:**
Naturally, there were stockpiles of food prepared for humans. There were even the oak trees that the fairies liked.

**Narration:**
As Lord, Boggart had done what was required of him. Even so, Boggart was now&mdash;

**Sheffield Guard:**
Lord Boggart, please, at least have a drink of this. It's morning dew of the thistle flower.

**Sheffield Guard:**
It might at least moisten your throat...

**Boggart:**
...

**Narration:**
Boggart did not move any longer. The heat had all but left his body, and the light all but left his eyes.

**Narration:**
It had been a lie that his strength had returned. It was the last remaining stubbornness of him as a lord.

**Boggart:**
......Hey, where is the Child of Prophecy...?

**Mash:**
...Yes, I'm right here with you, Lord Boggart.

**Boggart:**
...You? Well, that'd be right...the fairies are here too.

**Boggart:**
...This place leads to the Eastern Vein Corridor, Odovena. The Odovena is Britain's leyline cavern...

**Boggart:**
...you can get to any city without going up to the surface...if you wish to escape, use it well.

**Boggart:**
....Guards. If you have scattered the Queen's pursuers, remain here for a while.

**Boggart:**
Remember, do not seek sanctuary from Knocknarea in the north.

**Boggart:**
She is generous to those who come, but ruthless to those who leave.

**Boggart:**
As a ruler, she's no better than Morgan. If you must seek help, go to the Round Tables in the south&mdash;ugh...!

**Sheffield Guard:**
Lord Boggart! Please rest!

**Sheffield Guard:**
Leave it to us, the people of Sheffield, your people, we will protect them!

**Boggart:**
...the people of...Sheffield...

**Boggart:**
For 100 years...I came here, stirred by the anger of being driven out of Norwich...

**Boggart:**
...I had it better than I thought...I now realize that.

**Boggart:**
...I had land, had people...had a burning purpose.

**Boggart:**
......Oh, indeed, I hated Morgan. I hated Woodwose, I hated Spriggan.

**Boggart:**
I desired the throne of the Fairy Kingdom for vengeance, but...

**Boggart:**
I wanted to protect Norwich...I really did.

**Boggart:**
I wanted to live up to the expectations of me as a lord. I wanted to save my people. More than anything&mdash;

**Boggart:**
I wanted to return to my hometown. That bustling city of sea breeze and busy craftsmen...

**Boggart:**
...I wonder why. I thought I hated that restless place.

**Boggart:**
Are you familiar with these strange feelings, Child of Prophecy?

**Mash:**
...Yes.

**Mash:**
...It's called homesickness. From the beginning, you...

**Mash:**
Lord Boggart, you raised your troops just to save Norwich.

**Boggart:**
Ha. ...it's as if...you can see right through me, hahaha.

**Boggart:**
You, the “Child of Prophecy”, who despises war. What happened to that “Iron Cylinder”...?

**Narration:**
She shook her head. I wonder if Boggart noticed the look on her face.

**Boggart:**
...I see...I have given you an excuse to escape.

**Boggart:**
...I never had any doubt about myself as a lord, but...

**Boggart:**
....Mash. Until the very end, to you I was never&mdash;

**Narration:**
And so, Boggart drew his final breath in peace.

**Narration:**
The fairies mourned the loss of their lord, and felt the anxiety of what might happen tomorrow crashing down on them.

**Narration:**
Muffled air filled the cave. In the midst of it all, she alone looked up with strength.

**Sheffield Guard:**
Lady Mash, that shield in your hand...what are you going to do...?

**Habetrot:**
Well, you're not Boggart's wife anymore. So? What are you going to do from now on, Mash?

**Mash:**
I'm heading to Norwich.

**Sheffield Guard:**
Lady Mash!? No, are you going to Norwich all by yourself!?

**Mash:**
Yes. Not because I am the Child of Prophecy. I'm going to save Norwich from the danger it faces.

**Mash:**
That's what I want to do most now. It feels as if it is my duty.

**Sheffield Guard:**
That's...in that case, we will accompany you! We have to protect the Child of Prophecy!

**Habetrot:**
How-ev-er! Your job is to guard the people.

**Habetrot:**
I get how you feel, but if you're so heartless, Boggart will definitely come back to haunt you, don't you think?

**Sheffield Guard:**
Well, that's...that's true, isn't it! But is it really okay to go alone, Lady Mash?

**Habetrot:**
She's not alone, I'm with her. Besides, I'll be able to show her the way.

**Mash:**
Wolfie! I knew you'd be following me still!

**White Wolf:**
...

**Narration:**
The wolf did not give a single howl, but merely turned it's back on Mash and walked away.

**Narration:**
Deeper and deeper into the cave. Into the long, dark labyrinth they knew as Odovena..

**Habetrot:**
Eh, leaving already? You're so impatient. But well, we don't have much time, so we should hurry up.

**Habetrot:**
Using the Vein Corridor, it will take no less than a week to get to Norwich.

**Habetrot:**
There's no telling when the rumored “Calamity Pool” will come alive. We can't afford to waste any time.

**Sheffield Guard:**
...That's right. Odovena is a perilous place.

**Sheffield Guard:**
We would be a burden to Lady Mash.

**Sheffield Guard:**
...We wish you the best of luck, Lady Mash. You have our gratitude for saving Lord Boggart.

**Mash:**
&mdash;Yes. But it is I who should be grateful for everything.

**Mash:**
Please, everyone, don't make any rash decisions. Take good care of yourself.

**Mash:**
I am the knight of Sheffield, leave saving Norwich to me!

**Narration:**
And so, she departed on her journey, this time in the truest sense of the word.

**Narration:**
She would have various adventures in the Vein Corridor, but I'll spare you the details for the sake of brevity.

**Narration:**
After breaking through the labyrinth, and meeting with all kinds of different fairies, this lone Child of Prophecy would arrive at the city of her destiny, Norwich.

**Narration:**
To find out what would happen there, and what happens after&mdash;you'll just have to wait for the rest of the story!

## Section 8: River of Dracae 

**Oberon:**
And that's all there is to know about the current situation in Britain! I hope you got all that!

**Artoria:**
You managed to tour all of Britain in only two days!? Even though you're this tiny!?

**Oberon:**
We're on such a tight schedule, it makes the end of the year seem like a time to relax! I hope you realise that!

**Da Vinci:**
Sorry, but I don't understand a thing! It feels like you only showed me snapshots from your vacation!

**Da Vinci:**
You need to give us something more concrete to work with!

**Da Vinci:**
All I got from it was “peace,” “peace,” “danger”, “peace”, and “made you dumbfounded”!

**Oberon:**
Zzz......

**Da Vinci:**
Don't fall asleeeeeeep! Wake uuuuuuuuup!

**Oberon:**
Sorry. When I'm in my reconnaissance form, I end up a little less intelligent.

**Oberon:**
Anyways, there wasn't much movement in either Gloucester and Salisbury.

**Oberon:**
There's a rumor coming from Camelot that the Queen has begun preparing some large-scale magecraft.

**Oberon:**
And supposedly, the Calamity Pool in Norwich will rupture in a few days.

**Oberon:**
As for Sheffield, the cornerstone of the north&mdash;

**Oberon:**
...Well, I wasn't able to gather much, since there wasn't anyone left there any more.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But why suggest heading to Norwich now?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought you said it was still too early to tell?


---

**Oberon:**
To that end, actually, I think the time is ripe.

**Oberon:**
Fujimaru and da Vinci are serious about saving Britain.

**Oberon:**
Artoria's made her first reliable companions. And with Muramasa joining us, we've gained some ability to fight, too.

**Oberon:**
To be honest, even more fighting power would be ideal, but we can't be too greedy.

**Oberon:**
We're running out of time. Now is our last chance to head to Norwich.

**Artoria:**
Is that all there is to it? Is there not another reason?

**Artoria:**
When you talked about what happened in Sheffield, you seemed more shook up than usual.

**Oberon:**
There isn't another reason. None at all.

**Oberon:**
It's not as if I was thinking, “if everything goes well, we may be able to make a powerful ally in Sheffield.”

**Oberon:**
We only stopped here for a small break, didn't we?

**Oberon:**
It's not good to stay in one place. You guys are the center of attention in Britain right now.

**Oberon:**
Well, it'd be nice to have a base, but my forest isn't at all suitable for that.

**Oberon:**
If we were attacked, we wouldn't last a single day here. After all, that's what happened to Sheffi&mdash;

**Oberon:**
No, forget I said anything. It was a slip of the tongue.

**Oberon:**
Now's the time to gather allies. I strongly advise that we head to Norwich next.

**Oberon:**
Don't you agree, Fujimaru? I heard your proclamation earlier, after all.

**Oberon:**
You know it too, right? As the “Child of Prophecy”, Artoria lacks both self-confidence and...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Accomplishments.|

**Oberon:**
Exactly! As a savior, nothing is more important than having “saved a city”!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
True strength.

**Oberon:**
...no, well, it's good to be strong, but I'm talking about something else. You know, that thing.

**Oberon:**
...if you would, da Vinci?

**Da Vinci:**
The accomplishment of having “saved a city”. Artoria isn't a knight who fights alone.

**Da Vinci:**
If she's to lead a large number of fairies, reputation matters more than strength.


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
I see. If we can repel this Calamity, where even Queen Morgan has thrown in the towel,

**Senji Muramasa:**
the Child of Prophecy will no longer be but a mere rumor, and instead become reality. There wouldn't be anyone left who would doubt Artoria.

**Artoria:**
I'm sure you're right, but...umm...I wonder if the current me could really purify the Calamity Pool...

**Senji Muramasa:**
Without a doubt! You can do anything with that vigor you displayed at the auction house!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Worst case scenario, you'll get hit and shatter into a million pieces! I'll be right there to pick up your remains if you do!

**Senji Muramasa:**
You've got this far being reckless, haven't you? Isn't that right, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
With the same energy, you can do it!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If anything, getting shattered is when the real fight begins.


---

**Artoria:**
I'll have you know, I'm actually really cautious!

**???:**
That's right! Zooooooom!

**???:**
Artoria is a bear full of courage, vigor, and the power to lead us forward!

**???:**
She'll absolutely, absoluuuuutely be able to do something about Norwich, no doubt about it!

**???:**
Let's get going right away, and start on our journey! Our destination is Norwich, the City of Calamity!

**???:**
To save Britain, with all of our powers combined!

**Everyone else:**
...who are you!?

**I：???:**
Hello, nice to meet you! I'm Gareth!

**Gareth:**
Gareth the Wanderer, aspiring to be Artoria's squire!

**Welsh Fairy:**
<ruby><rb>![welsh1-light](https://i.imgur.com/vQCGvDe.png#gh-dark-mode-only)  ![welsh1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/8DaVFtt.png#gh-light-mode-only)</rb><rt>Here you go, here you go!</rt></ruby>

**Gareth:**
Aha. Thank you again for the food today. (Munch munch munch.)

**Gareth:**
Both the fruit that you gave me yesterday and today are absolutely delicious, thank you! The forest here is truly wonderful!

**Da Vinci:**
Sorry, but could we return to our earlier conversation? In summary, so far you've&mdash;

**Gareth:**
Yes! I've been following you since your time in Gloucester!

**Gareth:**
Ah, since you attended the auction, to be exact! Even against an enemy like Tristan, someone that every fairy fears,

**Gareth:**
you took her verbal slugfest head on, cool as a cucumber! And then even had a magecraft duel, like KABOOM!

**Gareth:**
“I ate my vegetables every day for sixteen years!”  “Go back to school and start from scratch!”

**Gareth:**
Yes... Just thinking back on it, your choice of words filled me with determination!

**Gareth:**
That's when I became convinced! Artoria is the lord whom I will serve!

**Gareth:**
And of course, I've been spying on what you've been doing since the auction, too!

**Gareth:**
Artoria was always the first to lend a hand, no matter how suspicious the person asking for help was!

**Gareth:**
I don't know anyone in Britain these days who would be so trusting towards other fairies!

**Gareth:**
I don't know much about Ainsel's prophecy, or even the rumors going around, but...

**Gareth:**
Artoria. I know that you are the one destined to save Britain.

**Gareth:**
So please...let me join you on your pilgrimage.

**Gareth:**
I'm a low-class fairy who has been wandering from city to city, but I, Gareth, will make myself useful for sure...!

**Artoria:**
Umm, uhhh... what should I do, guys?

**Artoria:**
I'm not the great fairy she makes me out to be, and being called a lord is just so...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria. You're smiling, you're definitely smiling!|

**Artoria:**
Huh, really!? Wait wait, deep breaths, take deep breaths!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This is definitely Gareth...)

**Da Vinci:**
(Yeah. Gareth, also known as Beaumains. One of the Knights of the Round Table in pan-human history.)

**Da Vinci:**
(But let's just keep quiet about that for now. After all, Artoria looks genuinely happy!)


---

**Oberon:**
...Can I ask you something? Why do you want to be Artoria's squire?

**Oberon:**
You said you don't care about Ainsel's prophecy, or the rumors going around.

**Oberon:**
So, you don't believe in the “Child of Prophecy”. That being the case, what is it that you see in Artoria?

**Gareth:**
That's... well, yes.

**Gareth:**
...To tell you the truth, I've been wandering for so long, I don't even know what kind of fairy I am.

**Gareth:**
I'm not part of the Wind Clan, nor the Earth Clan, nor the Fang Clan. I'm no good at any of that kind of stuff.

**Gareth:**
But ever since I was born, I've had this “purpose” in my heart...

**Gareth:**
This time, I will protect everyone. This time, I want to become a fairy who can fight for real.

**Gareth:**
...I want to actually help those who are suffering. That's the purpose in my heart right now.

**Gareth:**
But I'm not very strong, so the only thing I've been able to do is be patient.

**Gareth:**
I managed to get my hands on an iron weapon, and I'd been managing to defeat some of the Mors.

**Gareth:**
At the same time, I saw some Fairy Knights working for Her Majesty from afar. And then I thought, from the bottom of my heart,

**Gareth:**
“I want to become a knight like that, too.”

**Gareth:**
I want to become a knight who protects everyone, and become powerful enough to serve a ruler whom I really respect.

**Gareth:**
But soon after, I heard that Her Majesty Morgan was actually a bad ruler, and that the Fairy Knights were just knights who can defeat the Mors...

**Gareth:**
And so, I was convinced that my dream would never come true, as long as Britain stays the way it is.

**Gareth:**
<span style=font-size:25px>However! </span>

**Gareth:**
When I heard there was an auction for a fairy who would save Britain, I snuck in at the last possible moment.

**Gareth:**
After my fateful encounter with Artoria, my dream of becoming a knight came true!

**Gareth:**
Err, no, I haven't fulfilled my dream yet, but... it feels like I have.

**Gareth:**
Well, that's all I have to say!

**Gareth:**
I hope you understand why I want to serve Artoria now!

**Oberon:**
I see. Well, it can't be helped.

**Oberon:**
I suspected that she was a spy sent by Morgan, but there's no way someone this awkward and clumsy works for her.

**Oberon:**
And it looks like Artoria and Fujimaru support you.

**Oberon:**
So of course, I support you too. The more people we have on our side, the better. Let's work together from now on, Gareth.

**Oberon:**
Also, you mentioned you didn't know what kind of fairy you were, but I guess that's all sorted now.

**Oberon:**
You're the first subject of Artoria. Gareth, the “apprentice knight”.

**--BATTLE--:**

**Artoria:**
Nice combination! We did it, Gareth!

**Gareth:**
Yes! We may have been an inch from certain defeat, but that was a total victory!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You two are really getting along well!|

**Da Vinci:**
They seem to be about the same age too. Are you jealous, Fujimaru?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's an Okikuchan?

**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, I have a bad feeling about this... I hope it's not the first in a series to come.


---

**Oberon:**
I have never seen a fairy like that before. Maybe it was a stray fairy who made this place its territory?

**Oberon:**
Either way, good work everyone.

**Oberon:**
Fujimaru, da Vinci, and Artoria can return to the carriage.

**Oberon:**
Gareth and Muramasa, can you continue guarding Red Rab-bit for now?

**Oberon:**
Without proper protection, we're sitting ducks for bandits and beasts alike.

**Gareth:**
Leave it to me! Running is my specialty!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Da Vinci would attract the wrong kind of attention. We need someone who exudes toughness, I guess, huh?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
At this pace, how long will it take to get to Norwich?|


---

**Oberon:**
About two days or so, I believe. That is, assuming there's no trouble along the way.

**Oberon:**
Sure, stray fairy attacks like the one we just encountered don't really count, that's just par for the course.

**Oberon:**
What we should be worrying about is running into the Queen's guard patrols. They are also the reason why we don't go any faster than this.

**Oberon:**
A carriage going down the road in a hasty manner is an obvious case of someone running away from something, isn't it?

**Oberon:**
If they stopped us and looked in the carriage, we wouldn't be able to fool them.

**Da Vinci:**
The Child of Prophecy...are you saying there are wanted posters of Artoria out there?

**Oberon:**
No, not of Artoria. They would just see her as another country fairy.

**Oberon:**
It's Fujimaru who would be in danger.

**Oberon:**
In most cases, it's strictly forbidden for non-military personnel to go outside the city.

**Oberon:**
They would question {(M) him /(F) her} about which clan they belong to, and they would find out the truth.

**Da Vinci:**
Just like a police questioning...Morgan even has that stuff figured out.

**Oberon:**
Right. That's why we're maintaining this speed. We'll only let it fly when we're “completely hostile”.

**Oberon:**
By the way, Artoria, is this your first visit to Norwich?

**Artoria:**
Yeah, it's my first! Norwich, the city of blacksmiths! I've always wanted to go there!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? But, don't fairies hate iron?|


---

**Artoria:**
The Wind Clan does, but the Earth Clan treats it as a commodity.

**Artoria:**
Fairies hate “weapons made of iron”,

**Artoria:**
but when used in everyday items or constructions, they're not so averse to it.

**Artoria:**
Well, frequent handling of iron may get you complaints from those in the neighborhood, but that's just proof of your ability as a craftsman!

**Oberon:**
Hmm, it'll be your first time in Norwich, so I'm sorry you'll be seeing it in such a shocking state, but...

**Oberon:**
To be perfectly honest, this will be the first major turning point.

**Oberon:**
I believe Britain's fate will be decided by how well we fare in Norwich.

**Oberon:**
See, it's just as the prophecy said:

**Oberon:**
“A city of iron, a sea of soot. When the calamity is repelled, the pilgrimage will be hailed.”

**Da Vinci:**
That's definitely about Norwich, isn't it? The prophecy of the Child of Prophecy might be abstract 80% of the time,

**Da Vinci:**
but that line very clearly indicates a “where” and “what”.

**Da Vinci:**
Both for us, and for Artoria alike, it's a battle that we cannot afford to lose.

**Oberon:**
Right. Whether real or fake, the Child of Prophecy must save Norwich.

**Oberon:**
However, on the other hand, you could argue that no calamity will strike Norwich until the Child of Prophecy arrives there.

**Oberon:**
In that case, there's no need for us to worry too much right now.

**Oberon:**
This might be our last chance at a peaceful journey, so let's just enjoy it while we can.

**Oberon:**
Oh, right. This will be Fujimaru's first time east of Salisbury too, right?

**Oberon:**
We'll be passing Oxford soon. I'd suggest you get a good look.

**Oberon:**
Oxford is the home of Woodwose, chief of the Fang Clan. The city houses another bell that the Child of Prophecy must toll.

**Da Vinci:**
Huh, aren't we going to stop by?

**Oberon:**
Sure, I'd love to show you around the restaurant district by the main street, but Woodwose is a very violent man. If we meet, there will inevitably be a battle.

**Oberon:**
He wouldn't even try to test our mettle like Muryan did.

**Da Vinci:**
There would be no room for talking it out... so I guess Oxford's is a bell that must be rung by force?

**Oberon:**
You're right. It would be impossible for us to ring the bell there without the use of force.

**Oberon:**
Although the appearance of the Fairy Knights has diminished the extent of Woodwose's authority, the Fang Clan remains the dominating force in the Fairy Kingdom.

**Oberon:**
We won't be able to take on Oxford for quite some time still.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...and we would turn the city into a battlefield?|


---

**Oberon:**
...Well, that's the thing. You could say that's what ringing the bells is all about.

**Oberon:**
Aurora and Muryan are exceptions in that they don't want to turn their cities into battlefields.

**Oberon:**
But from the very start, Oxford is a place of bloodshed.

**Oberon:**
In year 800 of the Queen's Calendar, about 1,200 years ago now, this area was the domain of the Wing Clan.

**Oberon:**
But the Fang clan took it from them by force, and killed all the members of the Wing Clan.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In other words, Muryan in Gloucester is...|


---

**Artoria:**
There may have been others in the clan who survived, but...

**Artoria:**
From what I've heard, Muryan is one of the sole survivors of the Wing Clan.

 ~Oxford, the Clan Head's private chambers~

**Fang Fairy:**
Welcome back, Lord Woodwose. Thank you for your service at Camelot.

**Woodwose:**
Hmph, what a waste. Forced to spend my time in such inconclusive meetings.

**Woodwose:**
The number of tagalongs have also increased. Year by year, Her Majesty's audiences become increasingly suffocating.

**Woodwose:**
No, that's not the issue. The issue is the other clans!

**Woodwose:**
Spriggan and I are the only heads who attend!

**Woodwose:**
Knocknarea the rebel, Muryan the coward, and Ainsel, who remains forever in hiding!

**Woodwose:**
They only care about their own wants and needs, with no regard for the future of this realm! The only sane heads remaining are me and Aurora!

**Fang Fairy:**
So it is, indeed. Lord Woodwose is a patriot who truly concerns himself with the Fairy Kingdom.

**Fang Fairy:**
Please, as soon as you can, you should proceed with your marriage plans with Her Majesty...

**Woodwose:**
M-mm. That's right. The king of the Fairy Kingdom should be a man of strength.

**Woodwose:**
And yet, Beryl Gut...!

**Woodwose:**
While we were carefully laying the groundwork, he swooped in and took Her Majesty's hand as if it were his to take!

**Woodwose:**
The fact that he claims to be a “foreign magus” matters not, why should I be deceived by a mere human! 

**Fang Fairy:**
...L-Lord Woodwose...

**Human Guard:**
Excuse me, Lord of Oxford! I am here to report on the resource management at the ranch!

**Woodwose:**
&mdash;

**Fang Fairy:**
(Manoy...what awful timing...after all the trouble you went through to become a soldier...)

**Human Guard:**
Uh, uhm... Lord of Oxford. I'd l-like to state my report, if I may.

**Woodwose:**
I do not care. Speak.

**Human Guard:**
Sir! Of the 60 humans housed at the West Ranch, 10 were sent to Camelot, and the remaining 50...

**Woodwose:**
Were sent here. Hm... Well, that's good. With 50 men, we'll be able to let everyone with advancing Mors symptoms&mdash;

**Human Guard:**
About that...it's...the remaining 50 were all taken to Manchester, into Gawain's custody.

**Human Guard:**
She said they were in need of re-education..

**Woodwose:**
She can't do that! She confiscated them, that brat!

**Human Guard:**
Hyaa!?

**Fang Fairy:**
P-please calm down, Lord Woodwose...! The soldier merely stated his report!

**Woodwose:**
Quiet! Why should we suffer so for the sake of such a fragile being!?

**Woodwose:**
We can increase the number of humans as we wish, and yet the Queen hasn't increased the number of shipments at all!

**Fang Fairy:**
That's...because only humans with emotions have functioning creativity that can nurture us fairies...

**Woodwose:**
We cannot afford such flexibility in Britain right now!

**Woodwose:**
The Mors grow in number every day! If we don't increase our manpower, this city will be devoured!

**Woodwose:**
Or does the Queen think that it's of no issue, as long as she has her Fairy Knights!?

**Woodwose:**
You have no idea about the hardships our Fang clan has gone through to fight for our Queen...!

**Human Guard:**
&mdash;

**Fang Fairy:**
...Lord Woodwose...

**Woodwose:**
Huuu...

**Woodwose:**
...Be composed...be tolerant...for I am a warrior worthy of serving my Queen...

**Woodwose:**
Discard of the body. I will be having dinner.

**Woodwose:**
Aurora has brought some good wine. It seems the Wind Clan is also struggling to survive.

**Fang Fairy:**
J-just like that...

**Fang Fairy:**
...Manoy...you were a talented chef...but you said you wanted to be of help to Lord Woodwose, despite being human...

**Fang Fairy:**
If fairies and humans are so different...then why can't humans know their place...?

**--BATTLE--:**

**Senji Muramasa:**
This was the third one... Exterminating monster cats is not exactly my forte...

**Artoria:**
Since we spent the night by Oxford, we've been on the road for two days...

**Artoria:**
The animals are growing increasingly ferocious here. Could it be because we're so close to the Great Pit?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Great Pit...you mean the one you can see over there?|


---

**Artoria:**
Right, the Great Pit at the center of Britain.

**Artoria:**
And that wall rising up on its north side, as if to shelter the Great Pit, is Camelot Castle.

**Artoria:**
The capital of sin, Camelot, where Her Majesty Queen Morgan resides.

**Da Vinci:**
That Great Pit...Mike told me about it. He said it was a place to dispose of sinister things.

**Da Vinci:**
A fairy who lost their name may vanish from the city and end up in the forest in the west of the island.

**Da Vinci:**
However, some things are simply no longer needed, or just cannot be gotten rid of or destroyed. Things that are simply obstructions.

**Da Vinci:**
Such unwanted things are what we might call non-combustible waste. That hole is a place for disposing of such things.

**Da Vinci:**
It looks pretty deep, but I wonder just how deep it is. Could you tell, Muramasa?

**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, that? It's likely near 10,000 meters deep.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I fell in, but didn't reach the bottom. As I fell, Lancelot blew me off course.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Thankfully, I was able to catch myself on the wall.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ten thousand!?|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's as deep as the Mariana Trench!

**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, how do you know how deep the Mariana Trench is?

**Da Vinci:**
Is there a connection here, or what?


---

**Red Rabbit:**
My friends, please stop talking about the Great Pit. You'll bring bad luck over yourself and me alike listening to this.

**Red Rabbit:**
That Great Pit is something “everyone knows” of in the Fairy Kingdom, but “nobody should speak of”.

**Red Rabbit:**
It is simply bad luck. Do you remember the fairies who had gone there to dump their waste?

**Red Rabbit:**
They are ones who have sinned, and been put in charge of the Great Pit as punishment. The Pilgrims of the Landfill.

**Red Rabbit:**
Regular fairies shouldn't even be looking at the hole, so just forget about it.

**Da Vinci:**
Pilgrims in spite of being offenders...that's...

**Gareth:**
It's strange, isn't it? I thought it was strange too.

**Gareth:**
I don't understand why they're called pilgrims in the first place. “Pilgrim” is a word coined for the sake of the Child of Prophecy, isn't it?

**Gareth:**
A memento left behind by the six fairies who were there in the beginning.

**Gareth:**
They were enshrined, and the bell towers are a means of representing our roots.

**Gareth:**
And so, I heard that Ainsel named this journey to the bell tower shrines in order to govern the clans a “pilgrimage”.

**Da Vinci:**
I see. That's right, there shouldn't be such a concept as a “pilgrimage” in the Fairy Kingdom.

**Da Vinci:**
It's something made up specifically for the Child of Prophecy. That makes sense.

**Artoria:**
Huh? In Fujimaru's world...in pan-human history, is “pilgrimage” a common word?

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Religion...you're not familiar with that, are you?

**Da Vinci:**
If many people believe in, find salvation in, and cooperate under a single teaching...

**Da Vinci:**
If those people were to travel to the place where that teaching originated...to them, that place would be sacred,

**Da Vinci:**
and that's what you'd call a “pilgrimage”. In our world, it's something anyone can do.

**Da Vinci:**
It is the simplest and most important ritual you can partake in.

**Artoria:**
Anyone! You don't have to be chosen by a prophecy to go on a pilgrimage!

**Oberon:**
That's the beauty of pan-human history. Everyone is equal, and no one is special.

**Oberon:**
Even if you do something bad, you can be forgiven if you atone for your misdeeds. And even if you've done something good, you can still be punished for your wrongdoings.

**Oberon:**
Basically, it's a world of discussion. Though it's not always that simple.

**Oberon:**
What happens today carries over to tomorrow, and what happens tomorrow carries over to the next day.

**Oberon:**
There's no “eternity” or “change” the same way there is for fairies, so the outside world is constantly changing.

**Artoria:**
Woah&mdash;I see. It really is a very human land, isn't it?

**Artoria:**
As someone who is always falling behind, I think a world where everyone helps each other out sounds really nice.

**Artoria:**
No, everyone in the Fairy Kingdom are alike, so we shouldn't bother comparing who's better!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're right.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
At least Britain is lovely.


---

**Artoria:**
What about you, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?|


---

**Artoria:**
Ah, what? Did I ask that in a strange way just now maybe?

**Artoria:**
I just want to know how you feel about your own world.

**Artoria:**
How do you see yourself in the future, is what I'm trying to ask...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, like that...|


---

**Artoria:**
Yeah, like that.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't know how to put it, but...|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think I'll like it as much as anyone else...|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think it makes me just a little anxious...


---
**===Critical Branch End===:**

**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, that's a surprise! The Fairy Kingdom has splendid bridges too&mdash;

**Senji Muramasa:**
&mdash;hold up, is that it?

**Senji Muramasa:**
It's awful, the entire thing has collapsed from the piers up. Did they make a mistake in the structural analysis of the framework or something?

**Oberon:**
Some time ago, there was a rainy season in the Fairy Kingdom. The river probably flooded,

**Oberon:**
and that in combination with the Mors' violent rampages probably lead to this.

**Oberon:**
But we have other issues. On the other side of this “River of Tears”, beyond that hill, you can see Norwich, but...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is the river too deep to cross?|

**Oberon:**
Yes, it's much deeper than it seems. According to some it's even bottomless.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can fairy carriages fly...or something?

**Red Rabbit:**
Flying would be nonsensical! What do you think the ground is for!?

**Red Rabbit:**
Romance! Romance needs to be considered! Even had I wings, I would run on the ground! That's just how I am!

**Oberon:**
S-sure? I don't really get it, but I've received your complaint.


---

**Gareth:**
So this is the end for the carriage then? Thank you for your service, Red Rab-bit!

**Red Rabbit:**
What was that, you dog-eared mutt!? In this moment, I am Fujimaru's faithful steed.

**Red Rabbit:**
On our journey here, as I composed my poems, I swore to accompany {(M) him /(F) her} until the end of {(M) his /(F) her} journey.

**Red Rabbit:**
I would rather beat you here and now and return home, than be left behind by you lot.

**Red Rabbit:**
I hope that you will remember that I am prepared to go to such lengths, neigh-bour.

**Artoria:**
The River of Tears...! Then, this must be the river of Dracae!

**Da Vinci:**
What's that? Dracae? I recall there was a fairy of that name in pan-human history, however...

**Oberon:**
The Fairy Deadlord, Dracae. A great fairy once known as the Holy Grail of Water.

**Oberon:**
Her special trait was to “summon the treasures one desired”...

**Oberon:**
Well, it'd be easier if you just saw it, right? Look over there.

**Oberon:**
See all those fairies hanging around under the bridge? They're likely searching for Dracae as well.

**Earth Fairy:**
If you go into the river, you can't get out? That's because you guys are weak!

**Earth Fairy:**
Out of the way, cowards, I'll go first! Dracae, Dracae, can you hear my voice?

**Earth Fairy:**
What I wish for is a “silver axe”! I accidentally misplaced mine recently!

**Earth Fairy:**
I'd appreciate if you could bring me a new one&mdash;I knew it, yahoo! It's coming!

**Fang Fairy:**
I-it's not exactly what I wished for, but...

**Fang Fairy:**
Lord Woodwose ordered me to procure a hair ornament that would suit Lady Aurora...

**Fang Fairy:**
If I could get a “rainbow-colored hair piece” or something...ah, no way, something's actually coming...

**Fang Fairy:**
...I need to get it...need to get it...but all fairies who enter the river of Dracae, they all...

**Fang Fairy:**
Aah, my hand, something just...haa, something just grabbed me!? No, I knew it! I don't want it!

**Fang Fairy:**
I don't want it! This isn't what I wished for! Help me, somebody! Uwaaaaaa!

**Red Rabbit:**
Pardon me, may I leave you all here and go live with my parents?

**Gareth:**
Can you just keep your horse ears shut for a bit? You're ruining the story.

**Oberon:**
As you can see, Dracae is a most dangerous Fairy Deadlord.

**Oberon:**
“She lures you to the river with the treasures you desire, and once you grab them, she pulls you into the river to kill you.”

**Oberon:**
You could call it the scales of desire and life. That bridge was probably made to avoid Dracae.

**Senji Muramasa:**
So, it's dangerous to even be near the river.

**Senji Muramasa:**
However, we simply continue on foot from here, then.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I'll carry Fujimaru and we can jump across the decrepit bridge.

**Senji Muramasa:**
How about it, Artoria and Gareth? Could you make that jump?

**Artoria:**
Don't be absurd, Muramasa. How many meters is that even&ndash;

**Gareth:**
No problem, Gareth can handle it! I'm quite good at jumping, you see!

**Artoria:**
O-o-of course I could too, just like that, va-voom! Wouldn't be a problem! I'm the Child of Prophecy!

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm, it's not that I couldn't jump it, but I'm a bit unsure.

**Da Vinci:**
Oberon, this river, can it really be crossed like that?

**Oberon:**
No, it can't. The “treasures” would appear in the stream in the middle of the jump.

**Oberon:**
If you were to see any of it, that would be it. You would dive straight into the river.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Ah...I see. It seems I underestimated the Mystery of this fairy...

**Artoria:**
See what I mean, Muramasa!? You've got to think about what you're doing, Muramasa!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stay, Artoria. Stay.|

**Artoria:**
S-sorry...it's just...  Muramasa just reminds me of the old man from my village, so I just...

**Da Vinci:**
Then, we'll have to go around the river. Is it possible to go upstream?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So, we'll have to go around the river?


---

**Oberon:**
Right, if we go upstream, we'll be outside of Dracae's territory.

**Oberon:**
We'll lose about half a day doing so, but it's better than taking any risks.

**Oberon:**
Just don't look at the river. If you see “something you want”, ignore it even if it comes near you.

**Oberon:**
Dracae is invincible within the river, but she'll never leave it either.

**Oberon:**
As long as we stay away, there won't be any problems.

**Artoria:**
...“Treasures” floating up...uhm, Oberon.

**Artoria:**
If we were able to ignore what came down the stream, couldn't we then cross the river without having to worry?

**Oberon:**
No, as long as Dracae has magical energy, “treasures” will keep flowing endlessly.

**Oberon:**
If we try to just ignore them, we'll be locked in a constant struggle against Dracae.

**Oberon:**
...I guess something like that could work.

**Oberon:**
It's not so much something “you want”, more something you would give your life for.

**Oberon:**
Since we as a group have high aspirations of saving Norwich,

**Oberon:**
we might not be enchanted by Dracae's “treasures”. We might be able to force our way across.

**Gareth:**
Ah! Something's coming down the stream! Is that&mdash;

**Gareth:**
An Artoria plushiiieee!

**Oberon:**
There's no way you're not a dog fairy!

**Red Rabbit:**
A carrot over TWO METERS long!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that&mdash;no way, a Holy Grail!?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Grails are coming up the stream!

**Da Vinci:**
But that's nothing! A Grail or two now and then isn't too rare!

**Da Vinci:**
Don't underestimate Fujimaru's self-control&ndash;

**Da Vinci:**
Is that a dozen Grails!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can't get them out of my head...guh!|


---

**Da Vinci:**
This is bad. I didn't imagine it would be this good at nailing people's desires...however, I am the renaissance genius, Leonardo da Vinci.

**Da Vinci:**
No matter what, I won't be coerced&ndash;

**Da Vinci:**
Dinosaur fossils&mdash;!

**Senji Muramasa:**
How the hell did you guys ever make it through five Lostbelts!?

**Senji Muramasa:**
No, that's not it. That's just how strong Dracae is!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Don't look at the river, Artoria! I'm going to save those idiots who got dragged down!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Normally I wouldn't, but right now I am an imitation, so there's nothing I want!

**Artoria:**
Eh&mdash;ah, really!? Are you really that lacking in greed, Muramasa!?

**Senji Muramasa:**
Don't look over here, you idiot! The river's right there!

**Artoria:**
&mdash;Oh.

**Oberon:**
We just lost five people in under a minute! What are we gonna do, Muramasa!?

**Senji Muramasa:**
...that thing just now, was that really what she wished for?

**Senji Muramasa:**
You've gotta be kidding me&mdash;

**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, Oberon! Go find a rope and toss it into the river!

**Oberon:**
Like there'd be something as convenient as a rope... ah, crap, I looked at the river too!

**Oberon:**
I've done it now! What the hell is that coming down the river!?

**Oberon:**
Magical energy sold out!?

**--ARROW--:**

**Senji Muramasa:**
Hey, what do you have to say for yourselves, you morons? I'll give you one chance before I bonk you over the head.

**Everyone else:**
You seeeeee,

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
there was no way we weren't gonna get that stuff!|


---

**Everyone else:**
Ouch!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Do you really have no remorse!? When we deal with things in Norwich, you'll have an entire day of zazen to look forward to, you hear that!

**Artoria:**
Muramasa's so strict...

**Artoria:**
By the way, Fujimaru, what's zazen?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A discipline to make you feel calm and refreshed.|

**Artoria:**
That's so interesting! I wonder if the soul ever separates from the body!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A discipline to make you feel refreshed through beating.

**Artoria:**
T-that's a really special kind of training...it's too early for me to try that, I think....haha...


---

**Da Vinci:**
Aaaah! I thought I got the treasure, but it's gone!

**Da Vinci:**
You tricked us all along, Dracae!

**Gareth:**
For real...my Artoria figure disappeared too... I lost it when Muramasa whacked me...

**Senji Muramasa:**
Just as I thought. Basically, there's no way someone could manage to prepare the things everyone desires.

**Senji Muramasa:**
What you saw was merely a figment of your imagination. It was all just foam in the water.

**Red Rabbit:**
Your sweet tongue always knows what to say. Your sweet tongue.

**Senji Muramasa:**
O-oh, thank you.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, hopefully you've learned from this that not all that glitters is gold.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll think about what I've done...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now what?


---

**Artoria:**
It seems like we're at the bottom of the river... but I can't even see the surface if I look up.

**Artoria:**
This is without a doubt the fairy territory of Dracae.

**Artoria:**
Swimming straight up to get out...it's not something that will allow that.

**Senji Muramasa:**
We won't be able to return to the surface unless we deal with Dracae.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, now that it dragged all of you down here, I expect it to come to us...

**Senji Muramasa:**
What kind of fairy is Dracae even? Is she human-like? Fish-like?

**Gareth:**
A mermaid, they say...although, no fairy that's been dragged in has ever returned, so...

**Gareth:**
Oh, but I've heard it attacks more humans than fairies! She drags men down to make them her lovers!

**Gareth:**
They say that if you're human, you'll be let go before she kills you, and that's how the name Dracae came about in the first place.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Huh? Make them her lovers? As in, get hitched?

**Senji Muramasa:**
So when Dracae lures her prey to the river, she's looking for someone to marry...is what you're saying?

**Gareth:**
Yes! She's the terrible marriage hunting fairy!

**Da Vinci:**
...Hmm. That's just like our Dracae in pan-human history.

**Artoria:**
Yours, you mean...Dracae existed there as well?

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. It's part of folklore passed down throughout Europe.

**Da Vinci:**
She disguised herself as gold rings and dishes floating downstream, then dragged in men who would come to pick them up.

**Da Vinci:**
However, she wasn't just trying to find a lover. Dracae's purpose was to&mdash;

**???:**
Wish...wish...my...purpose...

**???:**
I beg of you...beg of you...please, I...

**???:**
Far...I have...searched...this...world　to...looked in vain...

**???:**
AA&mdash;AA&mdash;aaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!

**Senji Muramasa:**
She's coming, get ready! If she's attacking us, we have to respond! We can finish that thought later!

**Senji Muramasa:**
From the looks of it, this thing's serious! Don't be caught off guard, Fujimaru!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Dracae:**
Nowhere....nowhere...why...why...

**Dracae:**
What is...wish for...don't know...don't know... don't know...

**Dracae:**
But...a dream...saw...my...treasure...

**Dracae:**
My...love...my...

**Dracae:**
My...baby&mdash;

**Gareth:**
Dracae is dispersing... But, uhm...

**Gareth:**
What's that “bae bie” she mentioned? Do you know, Artoria?

**Artoria:**
No, I've never heard that word either. Baybie... (glances)...baby?

**Red Rabbit:**
I don't know why you're looking at me like that, I have never heard of such a thing either.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Huh?|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No, "baby", as in


---

**Da Vinci:**
...Yeah. Just as I thought, it seems.

**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, let's discuss this later, just the two of us. Alright?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? S-sure, got it.|


---

**Artoria:**
The flow of mana is normalizing! Dracae's fairy territory seems to be rescinding!

**Gareth:**
We did it! &mdash;guh—

**Gareth:**
Blub, blublub, blublublub! Blublub&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
Bluuubblub! Blububulub! Blublublubda!

**Oberon:**
I see. You fought Dracae at the bottom of the river and defeated her.

**Oberon:**
Then as you were having a casual conversation, you didn't realize the river turned back to normal, and so you almost drowned.

**Oberon:**
But you were swept downstream and managed to make it out alive, and then you walked back here.

**Oberon:**
Is that about right, ladies and gentlemen? Well, I was just here keeping an eye on our stuff, but that's fine I guess.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Don't be so down, Oberon. I'm sorry for leaving you here.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, you can put that rope away now. How'd you even find one?

**Oberon:**
You have Blanca to thank for that. She flew all the way out here to find us.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry you were left out, Oberon.|

**Oberon:**
Oh, it doesn't bother me. It's my fault for being late.

**Oberon:**
As an acquaintance of Shakespeare, I simply wanted to be involved if it was a comedy.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You should've come in as well.

**Oberon:**
No, I'm no good with water...thankfully Dracae's magical energy was sold out...


---

**Da Vinci:**
Either way, the threat of Dracae is no more. We can now cross the river.

**Da Vinci:**
Red Rab-bit, travel upstream until you find a bridge, then meet us at Norwich.

**Da Vinci:**
You stand out. If you remain outside the city, we'll easily spot you.

**Red Rabbit:**
...It seems that's how it will have to be. It is unfortunate I cannot offer you a comfortable journey in my carriage.

**Red Rabbit:**
Two days! No, as long as I don't run into some carrots on the way, I shall arrive at Norwich only one day after you.

**Red Rabbit:**
Until then, stay safe. And I sincerely ask that you not accept the service of any fairy horse but me.

**Oberon:**
Well then. The sun will set soon. Let's hurry across the river.

**Oberon:**
We'll set up camp on the other side to spend the night. Hey, there's no real rush to begin with.

**Oberon:**
Norwich is just a stone's throw away. We're on schedule, and we'll be right on time for our destiny.

**--BATTLE--:**

**Gareth:**
Facing such a terrifying enemy, and then getting to taste bread as delicious as this.

**Gareth:**
I hadn't really given much thought to the importance of a good meal before now, but,

**Gareth:**
it looked so delicious when Artoria ate, and after I tried copying her, I couldn't stop!

**Oberon:**
Come to think of it, Artoria eats a lot for someone from the Wind Clan.

**Oberon:**
If you're looking for someone whose purpose is food, it'd be the Fang Clan. Do you happen to be from the Fang Clan?

**Artoria:**
No, I'm actually not from any of the six clans. I'm just a low-class fairy who's not even good enough to be in a clan.

**Artoria:**
My habit of eating so much is because everyone in the village of Tintagel used to give me lots of food.

**Gareth:**
The village of Tintagel!

**Gareth:**
Then, you really did survive Woodwose's “hunt for the Child of Prophecy”!

**Artoria:**
No...well, I did survive, or I guess you could say I managed to escape using Merlin's magecraft...

**Artoria:**
It wasn't some sort of flashy show...that's a bit of an embellishment...

**Oberon:**
Speaking of which, do you know why restaurants are so prevalent in the Fairy Kingdom, Gareth?

**Gareth:**
N-no, I don't. I've never been let into one...

**Oberon:**
You see, they're actually a means of suppressing the Fang Clan's violent urges.

**Oberon:**
“The Fang Clan lacks decorum. You are an embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen's army.”

**Oberon:**
“Your cravings will be satisfied through meals. I, Woodwose, will give you an upbringing worthy of this clan.”

**Oberon:**
More or less. Before they knew it, it had grown into a huge franchise.

**Oberon:**
Being the owner of a restaurant was suddenly a sign of success in the Fairy Kingdom.

**Artoria:**
...Then, Woodwose fusses over his demeanor and dresses like a human, because...

**Oberon:**
Yeah, it's to draw attention from his own barbarous nature.

**Oberon:**
As the chief of the Fang Clan, he has to act like a gentleman, but his true nature remains the same.

**Oberon:**
He's savage, greedy, and the very personification of the Fang Clan, who take pleasure in preying on the weak.

**Oberon:**
Although that aspect has also calmed down with the rise of the Fairy Knights, so now he's mostly just an old man with authority.

**Gareth:**
Then, Woodwose isn't all that strong?

**Oberon:**
Yeah, he's just another old-timer by now. You, who defeated Dracae, are much stronger.

**Oberon:**
So, we should visit a restaurant after we defeat Woodwose.

**Oberon:**
I've only eaten at one a handful of times myself, but their food is exquisite. Their salads are especially good.

**Oberon:**
Even battles need their own rewards. I promise you that much, just as we'll help Artoria.

**Da Vinci:**
Right, Artoria and Gareth are still over by the campfire talking to Oberon.

**Da Vinci:**
Now then, as long as we keep our conversation all the way out here, Artoria and the others shouldn't be able to overhear us...

**Senji Muramasa:**
What, am I not supposed to be in on this? I'm also a Servant of pan-human history, aren't I?

**Da Vinci:**
Guess we have no choice...well, I guess we'll just have to tell Muramasa as well?

**Da Vinci:**
Alright, let's pick up where we left off. We were talking about Dracae in pan-human history.

**Da Vinci:**
Dracae would drag the opposite sex into the river, but not because she sought a lover.

**Da Vinci:**
Her purpose was to cross-breed with men. In the case of women, they were taken as wet nurses for the children she bore.

**Da Vinci:**
Meaning&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She didn't want lovers, she wanted babies...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She wanted to make children...


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, that's the goal. But in the case of the Dracae in this world, that has not come to pass.

**Da Vinci:**
Even though numerous men have been dragged into the river. Do you know why this is?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Could it be...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Because in the Fairy Kingdom, no children can be born?


---

**Da Vinci:**
That's the conclusion I came to as well. However, there is a more concerning issue.

**Da Vinci:**
We have learned so far that fairies mimic human society.

**Da Vinci:**
It would imply that both of them share the same “way of being”.

**Da Vinci:**
What fairy society lacks, human society also lacks.

**Da Vinci:**
In other words...humans in the Fairy Kingdom don't have the ability to reproduce naturally.

**Da Vinci:**
The concept of “giving birth” is lost here.

**Da Vinci:**
I became certain of this when they used terms like “previous generation” and “current generation”, as opposed to “parent” and “child”.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Hold up. It makes sense for fairies to come about naturally. In the first place, they're like nature's limbs.

**Senji Muramasa:**
But how could a human just come into being? They can't exactly come about by themselves.

**Da Vinci:**
Human beings are “produced”.

**Da Vinci:**
I don't know if it's a technique similar to artificial insemination, or the alchemical process of creating a homunculus.

**Da Vinci:**
But they are created “individually”, without parents or siblings, carefully nurtured, and then shipped off.

**Da Vinci:**
Of course, marriage customs like “husband” and “wife” exist, but they cannot produce offspring.

**Da Vinci:**
That is what it means to be human in this world. From our point of view, it's something rather inhumane.

**Da Vinci:**
But to the fairies in this world...Even to Artoria and Gareth, it would just be how things are. There would be no room to question it.

**Da Vinci:**
At this point I'm not sure what to make of this whole thing...

**Da Vinci:**
But if Fujimaru suddenly told them of this, they might be shocked.

**Da Vinci:**
It would create tension with Artoria and the others. I suggest we keep this information amongst ourselves.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'm fine with that, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Here, humans are limited to one generation...


---

**Oberon:**
...Alright. Is this far away enough?

**Oberon:**
I don't want to wake anyone when they're resting for tomorrow.

**Oberon:**
Something just flew out of Fujimaru's tent, but...

**Oberon:**
What was that just now, a bird? It couldn't be that they...secretly kept a bird, could it?

**Oberon:**
Oops, I'm sorry. Welcome back, Blanca.

**Oberon:**
What's the situation in Norwich? Will the Calamity strike tomorrow, you think?

**A：Blanca:**
&mdash;

**Oberon:**
Still no signs...I see, just in time...

**Oberon:**
As I thought, Ainsel's prescience can't be changed.

**Oberon:**
“On the contrary, no Calamity will strike Norwich before the Child of Prophecy arrives”...huh?

**Oberon:**
If Artoria arrives there, Norwich will fall. Knowing this, I still brought her here.

**Oberon:**
I asked her to repel the Calamity and shoulder the fall of Norwich.

**Oberon:**
...What a despicable and cowardly guide I am. I can't even let those involved determine their own fate.

**Oberon:**
...And yet, until we pass through this, none of it can begin.

**Oberon:**
According to the prophecy, the first bell of the pilgrimage is in Norwich.

**Oberon:**
Alright. Thank you, Blanca. You must be tired, be sure to get some rest.

**A：Blanca:**
&mdash;

**C：Oberon:**
No, I'm not going to tell any of them that we can't save Norwich.

**C：Oberon:**
It's not their sin to carry. I will shoulder this burden, should I have to.

**C：Oberon:**
Don't beat yourself up over it. It's all just as foretold, Blanca.

**C：Oberon:**
Besides, we'll have some time before the Calamity strikes, right?

**C：Oberon:**
Both Fujimaru and Artoria are in need of some happy memories.

**C：Oberon:**
Tomorrow, they can enjoy Norwich at their leisure. Our final battle will commence after that.

## Section 9: Norwich (I) 

**Human Soldiers:**
Hey, old fellow! Did you repair that armor I asked you about?

**Earth Fairy:**
Yeah, it's all done! I knocked it out in just two days!

**Earth Fairy:**
I know you value it, but it's high time you retire that thing!

**Earth Fairy:**
You better head over to the “brass shop” and get yourself a new suit of armor!

**Fang Fairy:**
Roasted apple!? Wouldn't that be hot!?

**Fang Fairy:**
There's something on it, it's covered! It's transparent! Glimmering!

**Human Shop Keeper:**
Master Fang, you must have just arrived in Norwich, is that right?

**Human Shop Keeper:**
This is the newest menu item thought up by the Count. You won't even find it in the poshest place in Oxford.

**Human Shop Keeper:**
If you think I'm lying, go ahead and try one. Free of charge! It's from a soup kitchen in the shopping district, after all!

**Well-built Man:**
Heeey, where's that soot-sweeping fairy!?

**Well-built Man:**
Is he off loitering somewhere instead of doing his job sweeping up!?

**Street Fairy:**
There's no problem, Master Human. THAT thing is gonna come down soon anyway, right?

**Street Fairy:**
The soot will all disappear then. Well, so will your apartment, I guess!

**Well-built Man:**
That's not what I'm talking about!

**Well-built Man:**
Even if it rains tomorrow, the windows should be cleaned! Even if there was a storm coming, the garden should be tended to!

**Well-built Man:**
Because, next thing you know, you have a new tenant at your door!

**Well-built Man:**
You should never miss out on a new customer! That's what business is all about, you hear me!?

**Street Fairy:**
Haha, you're right! When you're right up on main street, you gotta have gutters cleaner than even Spriggan's!

**Street Fairy:**
When it comes to money-making principles, you can't beat human beings after all! Don't go dying on me, old man!

**Back Alley Fairy:**
...Is this all you made yesterday? You guys aren't sleeping on the job, are you?

**Back Alley Fairy:**
Everyone's up in arms with all the talk of Morgan abandoning the city.

**Back Alley Fairy:**
The guards are even assembling at Spriggan's tower to patrol there.

**Back Alley Fairy:**
This is the perfect opportunity, you get it?

**Back Alley Fairy:**
We'll just borrow a little from those who've saved up lots...

**Earth Fairy:**
Damn it, the harbor is off-limits! That ocean-going ship is the Fairy Kingdom's first&mdash;

**Earth Fairy:**
The Inabamaru's construction was going so well! Do you wanna lose to the Count's cutty sark?

**Human Carpenter:**
Seems the lumber isn't gonna come either... What is Lord Spriggan planning...

**Everyone else:**
So overwhelming...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So noi&mdash;sy!|


---

**Oberon:**
Isn't it? This is Norwich. The only harbor town in all of Fairyland Britain.

**Oberon:**
One of the new laws introduced during the Queen's Calendar was that “no new iron weapons can be crafted”.

**Oberon:**
So for nearly 1,900 years, no new “iron weapons” were made in the entire Kingdom.

**Oberon:**
However...

**Earth Fairy:**
Ooh!? I thought I saw a fairy sticking out like a sore thumb! Is that you, Oberon!?

**Earth Fairy:**
You came all the way to Norwich? Even with the sky looking like that!?

**Oberon:**
Hm? Oh, that little rain cloud over there? You know, I thought the rainy season had already passed.

**Oberon:**
But well, one little rain cloud won't kill the bustling of Norwich, will it, Nack?

**Oberon:**
If a place seems interesting or fun, then the clever men are bound to go there.

**Oberon:**
Norwich is the place to go for a once in a lifetime frenzy, isn't it? As such, even the Fairy King will attend!

**Earth Fairy:**
Ha&mdash;haha, quite right! That's my Oberon!

**Earth Fairy:**
Yeah, we're all a bunch of misfits in Norwich, the city of illegal blacksmiths!

**Earth Fairy:**
Compared to the Queen's hammer, the Calamity Pool is nothing to be afraid of!

**Earth Fairy:**
Thank you, and please, stop by my store later! My wife's a fan of yours!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Hey, hey...that Earth Clan fairy just now, he had an outrageous aura...

**Senji Muramasa:**
200, 300 years? Just how many hundreds of years has he been swinging that hammer around?

**Artoria:**
I see. That fairy...Nack, was it? Just like Muramasa, he seemed totally unreasonable! What an amazing aura!

**Senji Muramasa:**
No, I didn't mean it like that...

**Oberon:**
Hahaha. Are you interested in Nack? If so, I'll show you to his forge later.

**Oberon:**
As far as I know, he's a low-class fairy who has lived for nearly 400 years. He's well versed in the history of blacksmithing in the Fairy Kingdom.

**Artoria:**
400 years! And he's a low-class fairy!?

**Oberon:**
He probably just never lost sight of his “purpose”. He's still active as a blacksmith, after all.

**Oberon:**
That's what I was trying to say earlier.

**Oberon:**
A hundred years ago, Spriggan lifted the ban on iron weapons, and Norwich expanded a lot as a result.

**Oberon:**
“Iron weapons” are able to hurt fairies. There would be an increase in homicide...or rather, fairycide, among the fairies.

**Oberon:**
Such apprehensions were the cause for the ban, but there was turbulence among the fairies in the north and the Mors were growing in number.

**Oberon:**
Above all else, the processing of iron was absolutely essential to the development of human technology.

**Oberon:**
Spriggan put such advice of its importance forward to the Queen, who acknowledged it.

**Oberon:**
Ever since then, Norwich was no longer simply a “city of fairies,” but a “city where the law of smithing came first”.

**Oberon:**
Salisbury is a place where humans might find freedom from the “rules of the Fairy Kingdom”.

**Oberon:**
But Norwich is a place where “all are equal under the rule of smithing”.

**Oberon:**
Some fairies still use humans as slaves, while others simply value them as skilled craftsmen.

**Oberon:**
But more importantly, even some fairies are only treated as labor force by human businessmen.

**Da Vinci:**
You're saying that regular humans are employing the fairies?

**Oberon:**
Yeah. Not in their shops on the main street, though. You know, like sweatshops.

**Oberon:**
Fairies are so pure that they're really easy to swindle.

**Oberon:**
Exploited until death, dying of overwork without receiving a single Morpound...

**Oberon:**
There are a lot of fairies like that here.

**Oberon:**
In simple terms, Norwich is a place where smiths and vices intermingle, you could say. Yeah.

**Oberon:**
But that's what a human city is supposed to be like, isn't it? The main streets are clean and well-kept, while the back streets are filthy and run-down.

**Oberon:**
The chief of the Earth Clan, and the lord of this city, Spriggan, is pushing for such a notion very blatantly.

**Oberon:**
It's almost as if he wants to turn Norwich into a “human city”...or at least that's what it seems like.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...A human city, huh...


---

**Gareth:**
Uhm...then, the reason for the Calamity Pool in the sky,

**Gareth:**
is because Norwich is a bad town? Did the Calamity come to this place because bad things happen here?

**Oberon:**
Not at all. No matter what city you're in, there's always gonna be good and bad. That's not exclusive to Norwich.

**Oberon:**
That this is the “location of the Calamity” is simply coincidence.

**Oberon:**
Right...looks like we still have plenty of time, so let's enjoy some leisure.

**Oberon:**
You're all free to go wherever you so please.

**Oberon:**
After all, we're here to deal with the Calamity Pool.

**Oberon:**
It will only be advantageous to have knowledge of the city we're meant to be protecting.

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I'd have to agree with that sentiment.

**Da Vinci:**
The Calamity Pool...I'd like to gather information about those rain clouds in the sky, as well.

**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, do you want to come with me?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.|


---

**Artoria:**
I'd like to head to the smithy of that Earth Clan fairy from earlier, Nack.

**Artoria:**
I have some some magecraft items I want to try out. I was hoping a skilled blacksmith could make them for me.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I'll come with you. I'm curious about these fairy blacksmiths.

**Senji Muramasa:**
I'm supposed to be your bodyguard in the first place.

**Gareth:**
Blacksmiths...I think I'd just be in your way if I came along...

**Oberon:**
How about we eat our way around town, then? I need to find a place to stay, though.

**Gareth:**
Can I!? Gareth joins Oberon's party!

**Oberon:**
It's settled then. Meet me on the main street at lunchtime.

**Oberon:**
In Norwich, they won't be suspicious of Fujimaru walking around alone.

**Oberon:**
However, if the guards were to question {(M) him /(F) her}, we'd be in trouble. Please take care of {(M) him /(F) her} should that happen, da Vinci.

**Da Vinci:**
I'll handle it. I'll assume the role of Fujimaru's big sister!

**Da Vinci:**
Now then. It would be nice to tour around Norwich, but there are a couple things we need to do first.

**Da Vinci:**
First, as I mentioned earlier, is to gather information on the dark cloud above us, the Calamity Pool.

**Da Vinci:**
How much actual damage has it caused at present, and how much damage will it continue to cause henceforth?

**Da Vinci:**
In practice, seeing whether it's possible to get rid of the rain clouds.

**Da Vinci:**
That's about it for the first one. Other than that, we have one more “thing to do”...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gather information on Mash!|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I didn't even have to tell you!

**Da Vinci:**
Let's start going around the shops on the main street.

**Da Vinci:**
We don't have a lot of time, and we might end up looking a bit suspicious, but we're going to really have to rush through this!

**Bartering Merchant Fairy:**
A human girl in black armor?

**Bartering Merchant Fairy:**
Hmm, folks from the Round Table Army stop by here to purchase goods, so I see people in armor on a daily basis, but...

**Bartering Merchant Fairy:**
I haven't seen one that's both a girl and wears black armor. Oh? But I do think I heard about something like that recently...

**Bartering Merchant Fairy:**
Well, now that you've come all the way here to talk, why don't you purchase a copy of my “Child of Prophecy” story?

**Bartering Merchant Fairy:**
It has the fight against Gawain at the West Ranch, and the fight against Tristan at Gloucester!

**Bartering Merchant Fairy:**
They're both really exciting, so if you're interested then I'll let you buy them for a Morpound!

**Bartering Merchant Fairy:**
I am certain that the Child of Prophecy has appeared!

**Bartering Merchant Fairy:**
When they come to Norwich, the Calamity Pool will be gone for good!

**The Best Shoemaker Around:**
Has the Calamity Pool caused any trouble? It should be easy enough to tell. The weather.

**The Best Shoemaker Around:**
It's gloomy, the winds are harsh, and it's growing colder! You'd think there'd eventually be some rainfall, but there never is!

**The Best Shoemaker Around:**
In the beginning I was afraid that Mors would rain down, but now, as you can see, it's business as usual.

**The Best Shoemaker Around:**
No one really knows what will happen once the Calamity Pool crashes down.

**The Best Shoemaker Around:**
Not to mention getting rid of it, I've never even thought about such a thing!

**The Best Shoemaker Around:**
Until now, Morgan's guys have been taking care of the Calamity Pool.

**The Best Shoemaker Around:**
But we can't rely on them this time. The Queen declared that she will be abandoning Norwich, damn it!

**The Best Shoemaker Around:**
...Ah, but now that you mention it, it is weird.

**The Best Shoemaker Around:**
Until now, how did the Queen get rid of the Calamity Pool?

**Café Waiter with a Red Beard:**
A human girl adorned in a black armor?

**Café Waiter with a Red Beard:**
Yes, of course I know of her! My other customers keep talking about her!

**Café Waiter with a Red Beard:**
She's famous up north! I don't really know the details though!

**Café Waiter with a Red Beard:**
Eek! Don't come at me so fast! I just about dropped these potatoes!

**Café Waiter with a Red Beard:**
Are you not keeping a close eye on your servant's training, young lady? Ah...

**Café Waiter with a Red Beard:**
Come to think of it, at one point there was a trend like that in Salisbury!

**Café Waiter with a Red Beard:**
You would purchase a human from a farm when they were but a child, to raise them as your own!

**Café Waiter with a Red Beard:**
If you raised them well, they could grow up to be something more than farmhands! That's right~!

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
I'm sorry. I'm a human, just like you. I don't know anything about the Calamity.

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
After all, I've never seen one happen.

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
They say the Calamity strikes once every 100 years, and the Great Calamity strikes every 1,000 years, but...

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
The Queen's Calendar will have passed over 2,000 years this year, won't it?

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
Everyone here is scared that a Great Calamity will strike.

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
My wife fell ill, and for the time being, I'm in charge of this establishment.

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
Every day, I wake up and crush my eyes...and then, the next morning, they've completely healed, and so I repeat crushing them over and over.

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
If people are so scared, why don't they flee from Norwich? Yeah...I've asked myself that too.

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
But we all have our reasons for not leaving this land. I don't want to say this out loud, but&mdash;

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
No, nevermind. If this got out, Spriggan's soldiers would kick my door down.

**Barbershop's Owner (Human):**
I don't want to worry the missus any more than she already is. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you to go somewhere else.

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm...well, that was about what we could have expected, wasn't it?

**Da Vinci:**
So that's it for the Calamity Pool, I guess. If there was a solution, they would have already executed it.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But we did learn some things about Mash.|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, it went from “people have never even heard of her” to “people have heard of her somewhere”.

**Da Vinci:**
I'll try to gather some more information this afternoon. To our surprise, Mash may be closer than we thought&mdash;

**Artoria:**
We're back! Nack's smithy was just amazing!

**Artoria:**
“I don't know how to put this, but I wish I could do something like this,” I thought as he easily made me magecraft items~!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, he had some great ideas! He invented Fairy Kingdom-style vacuum insulation!

**Senji Muramasa:**
The question is how light he can go...

**Senji Muramasa:**
Old man Nack had some surplus alloy steel, so hopefully he can forge it into some stainless steel.

**Oberon:**
You two getting along with your sinister schemes? Well, at least it seems you're getting your money's worth.

**Gareth:**
I have returned~...Amashing...the lounge in Norwich is just amashing~

**Gareth:**
There's a place called a sauna...it's really hot, but so relaxing...

**Gareth:**
And then...I had some of the best fruit juice...

**Gareth:**
If I'm going to stay anywhere, it has to be that inn...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for today, everyone.|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A hotel with a...spa?

**Da Vinci:**
So recreational facilities are that developed here...

**Da Vinci:**
It seems just because they don't share the same advancement in industrial technology, the concepts remain the same as in pan-human history.


---

**Oberon:**
Well, I'll spend some more time looking for a lodging place.

**Oberon:**
I didn't hear anything we haven't heard before.

**Oberon:**
It was all just complaints about Queen Morgan and people's hopes in the Child of Prophecy.

**Oberon:**
“When will the Child of Prophecy arrive?”, “When they come, they will be welcomed by the entire city!”

**Oberon:**
“There's no doubt they're a great-looking fairy!” , “I've never seen them, but I would definitely recognize them immediately!”

**Oberon:**
“Stronger than even Queen Morgan, more fair than even Lancelot,”

**Oberon:**
“More imposing than even Gawain, more tender than Tristan without a doubt!”

**Oberon:**
Well, they don't have the wildest idea you're already here!

**Artoria:**
Lower your voice, Oberoooon!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Only that last one is true.|

**Artoria:**
Hahaha...is that so...maybe...there was that thing with Tristan...

**Artoria:**
But it wasn't even a competition, so I feel both happy and sad...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't worry, you come out on top in all of them.

**Artoria:**
D-do you think so? Is that how you see it, Fujimaru?

**Artoria:**
True, I haven't really gotten serious yet! But I'll be in big trouble if I don't have some hidden power!


---

**B：Fairy by the Side:**
Eh...ah, woaaaaaahh! Seriously, my eyes and ears didn't deceive me!

**B：Fairy by the Side:**
Hey everyone, look! The Child of Prophecy is here!

**Artoria:**
Eh, ehh...! Wait a minute, can I have some time to prepare!?

**Artoria:**
Wrong, wrong, um, well, you're wrong, you're wrong, but...

**Artoria:**
I may not look like much, but you're right, I am the Child of Prophecy&mdash;

**Fairies in the Square:**
The knight from Sheffield who crossed the supposedly unsurmountable Vein Corridor!

**Fairies in the Square:**
She punished the despot Boggart, and has now come to help in Norwich!

**Fairies in the Square:**
The Child of Prophecy donned in black armor is here&mdash;!

**Spriggan:**
Good evening to you, my beloved citizens of Norwich. And please, be silent.

**Spriggan:**
Normally, I would announce something like this after getting word out for all of you to gather by the bell tower, however...

**Spriggan:**
If you all found out, there's no other choice. Let me introduce you all on this occasion.

**Spriggan:**
This knight is the hero who drove back the three Fairy Knights at Sheffield, and delivered the death penalty unto Boggart the exile.

**Spriggan:**
The Child of Prophecy, the Fairy Knight Galahad.

**Fairies:**
The Child of Prophecy! The Child of Prophecy! She has really high magical energy capacity, without a doubt!

**Fairies:**
But Spriggan, why is the Child of Prophecy here with you?

**Fairies:**
The Child of Prophecy is an adversary to Her Majesty Morgan, no?

**Spriggan:**
It is merely a misunderstanding. Her Majesty has never ordered such a thing as killing the Child of Prophecy.

**Spriggan:**
“Once located, politely take them into your custody, and invite them to Camelot.”

**Spriggan:**
That is the order the clan chiefs have been given by Her Majesty, Queen Morgan.

**Spriggan:**
So in accordance with that request, I personally went to receive Galahad, who had come through Odovena.

**Spriggan:**
We couldn't disregard the risk of something happening along the way, and so she was escorted here by my elite guard.

**A：Fairies:**
So that's how it is...the Child of Prophecy will soon be brought to Camelot...

**Spriggan:**
No, no!

**Spriggan:**
Her Majesty Morgan never ordered such a thing to occur “immediately”!

**Spriggan:**
I am Spriggan, chosen by your vote as head of the Earth Clan!

**Spriggan:**
My loyalty to Her Majesty Morgan is without doubt, but above all else, I prioritize the safety of everyone in Norwich.

**Spriggan:**
As such...for the time being, Lord Galahad will stay in my Vault Fortress.

**Spriggan:**
The Child of Prophecy has arrived in Norwich! The Calamity is no longer to be feared!

**Spriggan:**
Citizens, please find peace in keeping your businesses open!

**Spriggan:**
Let me, Spriggan, shoulder the responsibility of the Queen's scolding!

**Artoria:**
The c-c-child of prophecy...huh? Huuuuh?

**Artoria:**
Could it be that I have perhaps been incredibly embarrassingly mistaken? Ahahaha...

**Gareth:**
That cannot be right. Please have faith in yourself, Artoria!

**Gareth:**
I don't know who this Galahad is, but surely she's either a sham or the real deal!

**Gareth:**
Right? Isn't that right, Fujimaru? You've been with Artoria all this time and...

**Gareth:**
Why do you have an expression as if time stopped? If you betray us, I'll stab you, just so you know.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Because&mdash;because...|


---

**Gareth:**
Because?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's Mash&mdash;!|


---

**Oberon:**
What&mdash;!?

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
Ah, you can't! Calm down! You can't rush into the square right now...!

**Spriggan:**
Oh? I am in the middle of my speech, and you have strolled right through the crowd, up onto my stage.

**Spriggan:**
You are not from Norwich, are you?

**Spriggan:**
If you were, you would be aware of the consequences of such a thing&mdash;

**Spriggan:**
Hold it. Stand down. He's only human, hardly dangerous.

**Spriggan:**
Your features, they are Japanese, right? Then, you are the one of whom Beryl spoke...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Out of my way, I have no business with you!|


---

**Spriggan:**
If you have not come to see me, whom is it you have come to see?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's obvious&mdash;it's you, Mash!|


---

**Galahad:**
Mash...uhm, how did you know that name? You and I have never met, yet...

**Galahad:**
Ah...I see, it's what I called myself in Sheffield, so it must have spread from there.

**Galahad:**
Yes. I am Mash, Knight of Sheffield. I am also known as the Child of Prophecy.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh&mdash;?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Don't tell me...Mash doesn't remember either...?)


---

**Galahad:**
Just as Spriggan said, I have come to repel the Calamity from Norwich.

**Galahad:**
Though I cannot promise I will definitely be able to do so...

**Galahad:**
I hereby vow to fight until the very end with all my power. I would be blessed should you wish to lend me your power.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|


---

**Spriggan:**
That's our Child of Prophecy. What a wonderful announcement. These citizens will be able to rest soundly through the night.

**Spriggan:**
Enough talk. Guards, get this {(M) boy /(F) girl} away from me.

**Spriggan's Guard:**
Sir! Hey you, let's go! You should be glad you don't get a beating!

**Galahad:**
Ah...pardon me, could I have a few more moments with that&mdash;

**Spriggan:**
I am sorry, but we should return to the castle before long. Lord Galahad, this way, if you would.

**Spriggan:**
I have arranged a special carriage for you, fit for the Child of Prophecy...oh?

**Spriggan:**
Is all well with you? Your tears are falling.

**Galahad:**
Eh&mdash;huh, I am&mdash;why am I&mdash;

**Spriggan:**
You must have gotten some of Norwich's soot in your eyes. That's how it is in this town.

**Spriggan:**
Please rest for now, Child of Prophecy. My castle is the most secure location in all the Fairy Kingdom.

**Spriggan:**
...Guards. Keep an eye on the human for now. Should {(M) he /(F) she} go someplace outside of public favor, you may arrest {(M) him /(F) her}.

**Spriggan:**
I don't care if they feel it a little. As long as you don't kill them.

**Spriggan:**
They are another of Her Majesty's visitors. In times to come, they will be useful as a bargaining chip.

**Oberon:**
Phew, that was tense. I never thought we'd square off against Spriggan.

**Oberon:**
That guy was Spriggan, head of the Earth Clan. He's also the lord of Norwich.

**Oberon:**
And that girl he had with him. The one they called Child of Prophecy...

**Oberon:**
That was Mash, wasn't it?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Nodding)|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Yes, I'm certain. I could only see her from a distance, but that was definitely Mash.

**Da Vinci:**
...I don't know why she claims to be the Child of Prophecy, or why she didn't recognize Fujimaru...

**Da Vinci:**
No, it's a familiar case. The Nameless Forest.

**Da Vinci:**
I have a special memory capacity configured, compared to everyone else, so I could mitigate loss of myself, but...

**Da Vinci:**
Just like Fujimaru and Artoria,

**Da Vinci:**
it's very likely that she is experiencing temporary amnesia.

**Senji Muramasa:**
...However, Fujimaru's memories came back rather quickly, didn't they?

**Senji Muramasa:**
So why hasn't the shield girl gotten hers back yet?

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm...before remembering her true self, maybe she acquired a very strong “role”...

**Da Vinci:**
Perhaps? Whatever the case, we'll have to speak to Mash to find out what her condition is...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Still, she was safe.|


---

**Artoria:**
That's right. You were right all along, Fujimaru.

**Artoria:**
I was quite surprised when I heard her being called the Child of Prophecy,

**Artoria:**
but other than that, this is good. Now we know that she is staying here in Norwich.

**Oberon:**
Yeah. Spriggan may have beaten us to her, but the very least, it appears she'll be treated as a guest of honor.

**Oberon:**
We can try to create a situation where we're able to speak to Mash at some point. It's all just a matter of time.

**Oberon:**
On the other hand, a more immediate issue&mdash;

**Senji Muramasa:**
I got it. That group there, right?

**L：Spriggan's Guard:**
You, human, and your crew. You are all under suspicion of criminal activity.

**L：Spriggan's Guard:**
Please come peacefully. If you resist, you will be punished here and now as guilty criminals.

**Gareth:**
Spriggan's soldiers...! What are we gonna do, guys!?

**Artoria:**
We'll beat them up, of course! Right, Fujimaru!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, let's break through!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Our goal is just to retreat! Let's go!


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Senji Muramasa:**
Tch, a second group. Form up around Fujimaru!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Don't spread out too much, they'll pick us off one by one if we're separated!

**Gareth:**
Y-yes! You're right, they're much stronger than me...

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, they might not be on the same level as the soldiers from Olympus, but these soldiers are way too good! They're fairies!

**Artoria:**
(Let's see, in a case like this I need flash magecraft, flash magecraft...ah, I used it up at Nack's place!)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even more troops...!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I've got your back...!


---

**Spriggan's Guard:**
Good, the military police must've heard the commotion and come over. You guys, block off that alleyway!

**Spriggan's Guard:**
This is the end for your shady troupe! Lord Spriggan shall judge&mdash;what!?

**Norwich Military Police:**
It is you for whom this is over. This place is under the jurisdiction of us, the Norwich Business Association.

**Norwich Military Police:**
The City Lord's private army has no right to arrest here. You are the ones committing a crime here.

**Spriggan's Guard:**
What the hell is wrong with you? You're no more than humans...! What even is a Business soldier!?

**Norwich Military Police:**
We are a temporary security force acknowledged by the Business Association as a countermeasure against the Calamity Pool.

**Norwich Military Police:**
Our financier is the “Count”&mdash;do I need to answer any other questions?

**Spriggan's Guard:**
You're backed by the Count...!? No, we won't cause any trouble...!

**Spriggan's Guard:**
Guh...forget about it, let's go...! I'll remember that face of yours, Mr. Military Policeman!

**Gareth:**
They retreated quietly along with their wounded...but...

**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, you guys are also soldiers of Norwich, I can tell. Why are you helping us?

**Norwich Military Police:**
We do not know the specifics either. However, those two...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Me?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
And me?

**Norwich Military Police:**
Yes. The Count has asked me to extend an invitation to you both to his mansion as his guests.

**Norwich Military Police:**
As his guests, you are important visitors as far as we are concerned.

**Norwich Military Police:**
If you can spare the time, please make your way over to the Count's mansion.

**Norwich Military Police:**
And let me welcome you all warmly as the true saviors of Norwich&mdash;

**Norwich Military Police:**
Indeed, Count Peperon has relayed those words.

**Da Vinci:**
Huh?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Count Peperon&mdash;?|


---

**Count Peperon:**
Of cooouuurse it's me! Long time no see, my deeaaar Fujimaru!

**Artoria & Gareth:**
Watch out, a Fairy Deadlord&mdash;!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait, wait, wait.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know what you're thinking, but put your weapons away!


---

**Count Peperon:**
What's this~♡ I haven't seen you in so long, and suddenly you have two new cute girls with you!

**Count Peperon:**
Lady luck smiles on you! I guess you're not only popular with Mash, but also with the local girls!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Ah...Is that really Peperoncino? How flashy, I hardly recognized you...

**Senji Muramasa:**
No, it's not that I didn't recognize you. You're no longer merely a hungry raven. You're something more menacing, aren't you?

**Oberon:**
Oh, Muramasa knows him too? We've never met before. I would appreciate if someone introduced us.

**Count Peperon:**
Oh my! (Who's this handsome man next to Muramasa!?)

**Count Peperon:**
&mdash;Ahem. I am so sorry, I haven't introduced myself.

**Count Peperon:**
I am Count Peperon. An extraordinarily charismatic designer who flew in like a comet.

**Count Peperon:**
With my can-do spirit, I launched a brand which rivaled the Knocker Company in just a month.

**Count Peperon:**
Don't you worry too much about our past, okay Muramasa? Also...

**Oberon:**
Hello, Count Peperon. So this is you. It's an honor to meet you.

**Oberon:**
I am Oberon. Servant of pan-human history, Fairy King Oberon.

**R：Count Peperon:**
My! Oberon, THAT Oberon!? From “A Midsummer Night's Dream”!?

**Count Peperon:**
How wonderful, you're just like I imagined! You and I will get along splendidly!

**Count Peperon:**
Our names are similar after all! Peperon and Oberon, it must be a sign of talent~!

**Oberon:**
...Fujimaru. Do you really know this guy?

**Oberon:**
I don't think he's human in many senses of the word...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pepe is a splendid person.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have my doubts, but Pepe is human.


---

**Count Peperon:**
Fufu. With support like that, I can't help but feel calmer already.

**Count Peperon:**
Now then, shall we talk properly?

**Count Peperon:**
Why am I in the Fairy Kingdom? How did I acquire such a magnificent mansion?

**Count Peperon:**
I bet there's so much on your mind that you can hardly breathe, right?

**Da Vinci:**
No, we get it.

**Da Vinci:**
You followed Beryl here on your own in order to avenge Kirschtaria, didn't you?

**Da Vinci:**
While we were taking care of Limbo, you had a month's or so headstart on us.

**Da Vinci:**
And so, with your knowledge of pan-human history, you were unmatched in the Fairy Kingdom, and reigned under the guise of a charismatic designer.

**Da Vinci:**
Though maybe you got a bit carried away when you started calling yourself Count Peperon...

**Da Vinci:**
That's what I think. What about you, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Agree completely.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Da Vinci seems like she's seriously about to burst...!)


---

**Count Peperon:**
Thank you for the explanation! You really saved me there, da Vinci!

**Count Peperon:**
But I'm surprised how quick you were to point out Beryl. Do I seem like that much of an affectionate companion to you?

**Da Vinci:**
Eh?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh?|


---

**Count Peperon:**
...You can tell, right? How I'm both happy and sad.

**Count Peperon:**
When people put that kind of faith in you, it's difficult to keep acting as a Crypter.

**Da Vinci:**
Oh. You're still acting as a Crypter, then?

**Da Vinci:**
Kirschtaria came at odds with the Alien God. Rather, they were enemies from the onset.

**Da Vinci:**
You, who leaned so strongly on Kirschtaria... we assumed you were a Crypter no longer after Olympus...

**Count Peperon:**
I can't get off that easily. Daybit is still around, as well.

**Count Peperon:**
But this isn't about that. This isn't for Wodime's sake.

**Count Peperon:**
This is a matter of personal integrity.

**Count Peperon:**
As a member of the A-team, I have to clean up our own mess, you know?

**Count Peperon:**
Tell me, how was your fight against Wodime, Fujimaru?

**Count Peperon:**
Was it fun? Or perhaps bothersome?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It was both.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Kirschtaria was an amazing Master.


---

**Count Peperon:**
Right&mdash;

**Count Peperon:**
Well, let's talk some more about it.

**Count Peperon:**
And please, could you tell me as much as you can about the state of affairs in Chaldea?

**--ARROW--:**

**Count Peperon:**
I see...a crisis of the earth, separate from that of the Bleaching.

**Count Peperon:**
So, Fujimaru came to the Fairy Kingdom in order to prevent this “collapse” from happening.

**Count Peperon:**
You've convinced me. It's definitely a problem we cannot ignore.

**Count Peperon:**
But what went down after you arrived here is an issue. The reason why Mash isn't here.

**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, Mash, and I all took different paths through the Nameless Forest.

**Da Vinci:**
Somehow, Mash ended up going north, and was treated as the Child of Prophecy by the fairies there.

**Da Vinci:**
Do you know anything about how that happened, Count Peperon?

**Count Peperon:**
No, I don't. I have only heard that Mash is called the Child of Prophecy.

**Count Peperon:**
But...she most definitely is not. She's not even a fairy.

**Gareth:**
That's right. The Child of Prophecy is definitely Artoria!

**Artoria:**
Noo~~...Gareth, you don't have to be so assertive of that...do you?

**Count Peperon:**
No, I am certain you are the Child of Prophecy. You are with Fujimaru, after all.

**Count Peperon:**
I've heard Ainsel's prophecy too. A staff of selection, and a foreign traveler to act as a guide.

**Count Peperon:**
Those two things you definitely have. I'm certain Artoria is the savior of this world.

**Count Peperon:**
Not only does it match the contents of the prophecy, but the very color of your soul tells me as much.

**Count Peperon:**
Have faith, Artoria. You are much more tenacious than you might believe.

**Artoria:**
Huh&mdash;ah, yes. Thank you, Count Peperon.

**Count Peperon:**
But, is this really okay?

**Count Peperon:**
Speaking so lightly of pan-human history around Artoria and Gareth.

**Count Peperon:**
Have Chaldea's security measures really become so lax?

**Da Vinci:**
...It's as you say, and I'm sure Gordolf is going to lecture me about it later...

**Da Vinci:**
But our Master requested that we at least disclose our goal here.

**Count Peperon:**
My, how honest. But won't they grow suspicious?

**Count Peperon:**
If you speak openly about pan-human history in the Fairy Kingdom, people might come to question your sanity.

**Artoria:**
No need to worry about that. We don't understand a single word of what they've told us anyway!

**Gareth:**
What she said!

**Gareth:**
However, we do know that Fujimaru is working very hard, so it'll be alright!

**Count Peperon:**
You have such wonderful companions, don't you? I really do envy the fortune bestowed on you.

**Count Peperon:**
There may be people stronger than you, smarter than you, or what-have-you.

**Count Peperon:**
But to be “blessed with people who care for you” is only afforded to those who live their life like that.

**Count Peperon:**
It isn't allowed for someone like me who lived their life doing as they pleased! Only those alike yourself will join you, right?

**Da Vinci:**
That's not right, Count. Those soldiers from before, they trust in you.

**Da Vinci:**
That's not the kind of trust that money can buy. You're not as bad a person as you might think you are.

**Count Peperon:**
Really? Well, if you say so.

**Oberon:**
Count, may I ask you something?

**Count Peperon:**
What would that be? I wouldn't turn down a question from a prince, now would I?

**Oberon:**
I want to know what the deal is with Norwich and Spriggan.

**Oberon:**
Why haven't the fairies of Norwich evacuated?

**Oberon:**
What is Spriggan planning to do when the Calamity strikes?

**Oberon:**
Those two things are what I'm asking of you.

**Count Peperon:**
There's a simple answer, Oberon.

**Count Peperon:**
The fairies of Norwich haven't been evacuated because they don't fear death in the sense that we do...

**Count Peperon:**
However, the biggest contributors are “work” and “land”.

**Count Peperon:**
Fairies value their “purpose” above all else, right?

**Count Peperon:**
For the fairies of Norwich, “purpose” amounts to “work” itself.

**Count Peperon:**
They can't abandon their “work” so easily, and so they are mentally shackled.

**Count Peperon:**
In addition, before the dark cloud appeared in the sky, Spriggan put Norwich's land up for sale.

**Count Peperon:**
In the past, Spriggan stole the land from the previous lord.

**Count Peperon:**
The former lord, and all the fairies who had owned the land, were exiled to the north.

**Count Peperon:**
After that, Spriggan owned all the land by himself.

**Count Peperon:**
Until now, the blacksmiths in Norwich had simply been renting the land to conduct business here.

**Count Peperon:**
But now it was finally up for sale, so the fairies all bought their own piece of “land”.

**Count Peperon:**
Until now, those fairies had been exploited by Spriggan,

**Count Peperon:**
but now, after paying with everything they had, they finally owned their “own land”.

**Count Peperon:**
The tension in Norwich had lifted, but shortly afterwards&mdash;

**Da Vinci:**
The Calamity Pool appeared in the sky above Norwich...

**Da Vinci:**
The reason the fairies won't leave Norwich is because they now own their own plot of “land”.

**Senji Muramasa:**
For a blacksmith, his workshop is more important than even his life.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Which means, no matter how scared they are of some “Calamity Pool”, they can't leave this place.

**Gareth:**
Is that why you organized those soldiers? You were worried about Spriggan's soldiers acting alone.

**Count Peperon:**
No. Spriggan's soldiers have no intention of protecting Norwich in the first place.

**Count Peperon:**
They'd rather let the Calamity come.

**Count Peperon:**
I assume that they would rather all the fairies and buildings in town simply disappear.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why, though?|

**Count Peperon:**
Well, you know...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Right...then the contract is annulled, I guess.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Ah, I understand. It's land sharking, isn't it?

**Count Peperon:**
Right. As expected of you, Muramasa, you're accustomed to this kind of talk.


---

**Count Peperon:**
Spriggan never had any intention of giving up his land. He simply knew the Calamity was coming.

**Count Peperon:**
Well, it's just as the prophecy says, “Calamity will come to a city of iron and soot”.

**Count Peperon:**
As such, he initially sold off the land to the fairies at extortionate prices.

**Count Peperon:**
Afterwards, when the Calamity in Norwich has been dealt with, he would reclaim the rights to the land.

**Count Peperon:**
The inheritance tax in Norwich is very high. It's not something the “next generation of fairies” could afford.

**Count Peperon:**
With minimal effort, Spriggan was able to pocket the profit of selling the land.

**Count Peperon:**
And later, he will have the opportunity to redevelop Norwich as he sees fit.

**Count Peperon:**
He struck two birds with one stone. You'd think such a crooked fairy could only exist in pan-human history, wouldn't you?

**Oberon:**
Even compared to pan-human history, he's a villain! Spriggan, how can you be so shameless...!

**Artoria:**
So the fairies of Norwich just “continue their daily lives”...

**Artoria:**
No, it's as if they have to. Because if they leave...

**Gareth:**
They would be penniless...and as it stands now, in the Fairy Kingdom, that means being unable to pay next year's “existence tax”.

**Oberon:**
It's improper.

**Oberon:**
There are still fairies in Norwich who care for their human servants...

**Oberon:**
But when the Calamity strikes, the humans will die.

**Oberon:**
Even though the fairies sympathetic to humans want to escape Norwich, they cannot find the resolve to do so.

**Da Vinci:**
Hold on. Spriggan doesn't have any intention of protecting Norwich, you said?

**Da Vinci:**
Then, him taking in Mash before means...!

**Oberon:**
Yeah, though there's no need to worry about her. When I saw her earlier, she exuded the magical energy capacity of a Fairy Knight.

**Oberon:**
Spriggan wouldn't be able to take her on. His best bet would be to distract her in his castle to keep her away for long enough.

**Oberon:**
The issue is...that means there's no way for us to meet with Mash anymore.

**Artoria:**
Ah, you're right...

**Artoria:**
Spriggan wants to save his own hide, so there is no way he would let the Child of Prophecy outside...

**Artoria:**
If she started talking to the citizens or the like, she would immediately catch wind about his plans...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...We won't be able to meet with Mash?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...So we have to sneak into Spriggan's castle?


---

**Count Peperon:**
I would recommend against doing such a thing. Spriggan's castle is the most well-guarded castle in all the Fairy Kingdom.

**Count Peperon:**
It's like Spriggan's personality—“no one can get it”, “no one is allowed to disturb”—given form.

**Count Peperon:**
It's also known as his Vault Fortress. Even a Fairy Knight would find it difficult to break in there.

**Count Peperon:**
In hindsight, it might have been a mistake to let Mash be taken by Spriggan in the first place...

**Count Peperon:**
If you want to see Mash, she will have to come out of the castle.

**--BATTLE--:**

**Count Peperon:**
Alrighty, that concludes the battle~☆ You lovelies really showed me what you're capable of~!

**Gareth:**
Ooh...those were Norwich's specialty, golems, “treasures that come alive with use of fairy dust”!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good job, everyone~☆|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why were we suddenly brought to this mountain side, I don't get it...


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
We were in the middle of a conversation when he interrupted, saying “how about some exercise?”  and I was taken aback...

**Senji Muramasa:**
But the fight turned out to be a cakewalk! I do appreciate being able to take the backseat!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Count, can I grab this thing as my reward?

**Count Peperon:**
Of course. Anything for the Child of Prophecy. They deserve to live a rich life after all, don't they?

**Gareth:**
Right you are! Thank you so much, Count!

**Gareth:**
Artoria, Fujimaru! Let's go to the shops when we get back to Norwich!

**Gareth:**
There's some wakame-flavored ice cream, and they say it's just so delicious!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Wakame-flavored...is this Tokushima?)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Well...a seaside town would have that...)


---

**Artoria:**
Hmm, I think I'll wait and see! Gramps... I mean, Muramasa said he'd taste it first!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Haa, wakame-flavored sweets? You want me to eat seaweed sprinkled with sugar?

**Senji Muramasa:**
...Well, can't knock it til I try it, can I? Can't you just let me have normal ice cream, though...?

**Da Vinci:**
Hmhm, that was a great way to ease the tension everyone was feeling about the situation in Norwich.

**Da Vinci:**
Combining a distraction and a test of our mettle into one and the same? You're cunning, Count.

**Count Peperon:**
It was simply a chore that had to be taken care of. I had been asked to get rid of the golems in the area.

**Count Peperon:**
Don't put too much faith in me, okay, da Vinci?

**Count Peperon:**
As I said, I'm still a Crypter. Once Beryl has been dealt with, I will return to being your adversary.

**Da Vinci:**
...Crypter. Myourenji Arou, that was your birthname, right?

**Da Vinci:**
According to Chaldea's records, you were handling dirty work for the Mage's Association at the time you were recruited by Marisbilly,

**Da Vinci:**
and after joining the Astromancy department, you finally ended up at Chaldea.

**Da Vinci:**
...That's as much as you told us in India. However, there are no records of what you did before all that.

**Da Vinci:**
You helped us out in both India and at Olympus. And now we're to cooperate here in Britain as well.

**Da Vinci:**
I'd say it's not too much of me to ask for a fellow companion to share his backstory, is it?

**Count Peperon:**
My! What a line, it struck right at my heart! You really are a universal genius! What a perfect pick-up line!

**Da Vinci:**
Wow, I've never attempted pick-ups before, but I guess that WAS a perfect pick-up line just now.

**Count Peperon:**
Yes, a fantastic one, I must say.

**Count Peperon:**
Because you didn't say that for the sake of Chaldea, but for my own sake.

**Count Peperon:**
Then, what kind of man would I be if I did not give an answer. &mdash;It's not a very exciting story, shall I tell it anyway?

**Count Peperon:**
Myourenji Arou. What happened during the time when I still carried that name?

**Count Peperon:**
What sort of person was I?

**Count Peperon:**
Well, since you knew about my dirty work for the Clock Tower, you likely have some idea already.

**Count Peperon:**
My family was one of Shugendou practitioners. More specifically&mdash;of tengu techniques.

**Count Peperon:**
A school of Shugendou with the premise of arriving at hell by corrupting into a tengu.

**Count Peperon:**
I seemed to be exceptionally talented, and was praised for it, but...

**Count Peperon:**
I only wanted to be myself, you know? Ultimately, that ended up getting me excommunicated.

**Count Peperon:**
After that, I no longer had any business with my family, and so I&mdash;settled things, and left Japan.

**Da Vinci:**
Settled things, what does that mean?

**Count Peperon:**
I massacred my family and their disciples.

**Da Vinci:**
...That's why no one knows about your past... and why there aren't any records of it, isn't it?

**Da Vinci:**
Just in case, I'll ask you, why?

**Count Peperon:**
...I don't really have an answer, just that I thought they were bad.

**Count Peperon:**
For one generation, the Myourenji were a family of Houjutsu practitioners.

**Count Peperon:**
When the founder fell to the world of the tengu, he connected a path to the Maouson on the mountain, but...

**Count Peperon:**
The issue was, that path was only for the “founder”. As such, his descendants faced some trouble.

**Count Peperon:**
Long training were forced on us in order to superhumanize our bodies without the help of the Maouson.

**Count Peperon:**
In terms of magi, well...it's probably more accurate to say we were like Muramasa.

**Count Peperon:**
Through rigorous work they would create a special “body”—special “circuits”—that would only be around for a single generation, as they died without passing it on to their descendants.

**Count Peperon:**
That wasn't my issue, though. My issue was how the family was set up.

**Count Peperon:**
I'm a direct descendant of the “founder”, so I was born and raised on the mountain, but...

**Count Peperon:**
The other children in the Myourenji family were kidnapped from the world below the mountain, you see?

**Count Peperon:**
Back in the days, when the mortality rate of childbirth was higher, kidnapping children to raise them and act as their foster parent...

**Count Peperon:**
Such a thing might have been fine, but&mdash;

**Count Peperon:**
If they couldn't keep up with the training, you'd be thrown down the mountain. Even if you endured the training, you were only bound to descend into hell.

**Count Peperon:**
There is nothing to gain from meddling in other people's fate, only to corrupt them into tengu.

**Count Peperon:**
There was nothing to be gained for those people. That is why I killed every single one of them as I climbed down the mountain.

**Da Vinci:**
Even though they were your family?

**Count Peperon:**
Because they were my family. If they were mere strangers, I would have been able to ignore them.

**Count Peperon:**
But because we were family, related by blood, I had to assume full responsibility, wouldn't you say?

**Count Peperon:**
I might be a man of compassion, but my fastidiousness takes priority. In the end, a clean slate took priority over even my feelings for my relatives.

**Count Peperon:**
Just as I am now a brute who prioritizes settling the score over my sentiment as Crypter.

**Count Peperon:**
I'm convinced this is the reason I have cooperated with you all these times.

**Count Peperon:**
Do you understand now?

**Da Vinci:**
Indeed. You've displayed strength far beyond what I imagined.

**Da Vinci:**
Although, I am curious about something. When you said you were talented, what extent are we talking about?

**Count Peperon:**
Let's see...

**Count Peperon:**
The Shugendou practitioners of the Myourenji family would acquire an abhijñā after 100 years of training...

**Count Peperon:**
If you were able to acquire even one of the six abhijñā, you would qualify as a tengu...

**Count Peperon:**
By the age of 10, I had acquired three of them.

**Count Peperon:**
Shinsokutsuu, to run long distances; Tashintsuu, to read others' minds.

**Count Peperon:**
And then...Roshintsuu, awareness of one's own lifespan and destiny.

**Count Peperon:**
That's the kind of stuff you'd expect from the family's greatest genius!

**Count Peperon:**
Dear me, I'm SUCH a luxury! I've been a deceitful man since I was born!

**Count Peperon:**
But about this, don't go telling anyone!

**Count Peperon:**
I hope this can stay between just me and you, da Vinci!

**Da Vinci:**
Thank goodness Count Peperon is such a gourmand~!

**Da Vinci:**
It's been 26 days since we arrived in the Fairy Kingdom, and during all that time we haven't had a full course meal!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A mix of Italian and Japanese cuisine.|

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, Artoria and Gareth seemed apprehensive about eating at first, but they devoured it in the end.

**Da Vinci:**
Oberon was out of his seat, though. Now that I think about it, it's rare to see him eat.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh...? Hasn't it only been 16 days?

**Da Vinci:**
Ah, I knew there would be a discrepancy there.

**Da Vinci:**
I've suspected it since Salisbury, but now is as good a time as any to explain it.

**Da Vinci:**
Most likely, the time you have spent in the Fairy Kingdom is 10 days more than what you think.

**Da Vinci:**
You told me you were in the fairy village in the Nameless Forest, but it had already been 10 days before you woke up there.

**Da Vinci:**
About 10 days after I started working for Mike is when you guys finally showed up.


---

**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, it's getting late. We'll have a lot to think about tomorrow, so I think it's best we rest now.

**Da Vinci:**
One party will scout out Spriggan's Vault Fortress, while another investigates the Calamity Pool in the sky.

**Da Vinci:**
We can split up first thing in the morning, and afterwards we'll know what we need to plan for.

**Da Vinci:**
Well then, good night, Fujimaru. The Count prepared private rooms for us.

**Da Vinci:**
So take it easy tonight, okay?

**Oberon:**
Oh.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon.|

**Oberon:**
Good evening, Fujimaru. I was just heading out for a bit.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
More reconnaissance, dressed like that?


---

**Oberon:**
Unlike the rest of you, I can't fight. I have to at least do some scouting for you.

**Oberon:**
You're heading to bed, are you? We've been out on the plains for a long time now, so it must be nice sleeping in a proper bed again.

**Oberon:**
Not only did Artoria reach Norwich, but Mash appeared as another Child of Prophecy.

**Oberon:**
In this case, there's no way Morgan won't act. I'll have to keep a careful eye on Camelot for now.

**Oberon:**
No sweat, I'll be back by sunrise. Well then&mdash;

**Oberon:**
...No.

**Oberon:**
...Excuse my curtness, but are you alright?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...What?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Do I seem overworked?


---

**Oberon:**
Yeah. When we were talking about Spriggan and Mash earlier, I thought you were gonna get up and storm the Vault Fortress then and there.

**Oberon:**
But you kept quiet. You didn't change your priorities.

**Oberon:**
All you wanted was to see Mash, but your responsibility as Master of Chaldea held you back.

**Oberon:**
It was a smart decision, but I could tell it bothered you. I could see it on your face.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Worry and trust are different, aren't they?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're the one who taught me that, Oberon.


---

**Oberon:**
Hmm, well, I did say that, but...

**Oberon:**
...I just didn't expect you to meet her so soon... I shouldn't have said those things...

**Oberon:**
No, it was nothing. I just had something I need to tell you.

**Oberon:**
...You said Mash hadn't recovered her memories yet, that she had forgotten her name in the Nameless Forest.

**Oberon:**
Da Vinci's hypothesis was correct. If someone loses their name in that forest,

**Oberon:**
and before recovering their memories, acquires a more powerful role than their former self&mdash;

**Oberon:**
Having acquired a “new self”, sometimes, it might not be possible to go back to their “old self”.

**Oberon:**
I don't know how she got caught up in the whole “Child of Prophecy” thing,

**Oberon:**
but do you believe that the girl you knew as Mash once held a greater role than that of the Child of Prophecy?

**Oberon:**
A herculean burden of shouldering the hopes of countless people. The indescribable torment of being responsible for the fate of an entire world.

**Oberon:**
...Yeah, I'm sorry, but I cannot imagine anything greater than that. The Mash you sought is gone.

**Oberon:**
But to expose the riddle of the Fairy Kingdom, we only have need of one Child of Prophecy. And we already have Artoria.

**Oberon:**
So&mdash;is there a need for you to care?

**Oberon:**
If Mash will never remember you? If she will never return to being the girl you once knew?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|


---

**Oberon:**
...of course there is. I can see it on your face.

**Oberon:**
It was a dumb question. I'm sorry I wasted your time.

**Oberon:**
If this is what you've decided, I'll do what I can. Leave it to me to figure out the state of this world!

**Oberon:**
Let's go, Vesper! Speedstar, prepare for take-off!

**--ARROW--:**

**Count Peperon:**
HEY, GOOD MORNING! Did you all have a good night's sleep?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All thanks to you.|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It even beats the Ritz.

**Count Peperon:**
Doesn't it, doesn't it? You can simply get lost in the exquisite upholstery and the bedding, can't you!

**Count Peperon:**
But when you say Ritz, which Ritz do you mean, I wonder&mdash;! There's so much going on, little me can't keep up&mdash;!


---

**Count Peperon:**
In any case, we should have a serious talk before breakfast.

**Count Peperon:**
I want to consult with you about Norwich's security, but...

**Count Peperon:**
Oberon, you go first. You have something to share with everyone, don't you?

**Oberon:**
Thank you for the thought, Count. I'll share a few words, then.

**Oberon:**
Last night, I scouted the area around Norwich, as well as the circumstances at Camelot.

**Oberon:**
As for the rain clouds over Norwich...the Calamity Pool, it's gaining momentum.

**Oberon:**
The rotational velocity of the vortex is increasing, that is. I hadn't noticed until now, but it's giving off a tremendous amount of magical energy.

**Oberon:**
If we likened it to pure fuel, it would be enough to burn all of Norwich to the ground.

**Da Vinci:**
I have confirmed the same.

**Da Vinci:**
Yesterday, it was nothing more than rain clouds. But this morning, I was able to measure an amount of magical energy comparable to a super-sized nuclear reactor core.

**Senji Muramasa:**
A super-sized nuclear reactor core. Huh, what would that be like? The Machine Gods of Olympus?

**Da Vinci:**
Not on the level of a Machine God, but...in Chaldea terms, it would be the equivalent of two months of electricity used.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An amount on the scale of Singularity Restoration Rayshifting...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Does that amount include the upkeep for Servants...?)


---

**Oberon:**
Hmm, Chaldea really is an amazing place, isn't it? To be able to consume that much magical energy in such a short time, you know?

**Oberon:**
Anyway, the situation in Norwich has degraded compared to yesterday. The citizens were on edge this morning.

**Oberon:**
As for Camelot, fortunately, there has been no signs of movement as of yet.

**Oberon:**
No sign of an army leaving the castle. At most, about 20 soldiers have gone out to deal with Mors.

**Oberon:**
One more thing...let's see, right, Morgan has apparently sent everyone away and shut herself in her throne room since last night.

**Artoria:**
...

**Artoria:**
So then, Spriggan hasn't told Her Majesty about Mash... I mean, the Child of Prophecy?

**Oberon:**
That's a safe bet. In part due to Spriggan's own greed, I'd assume.

**Oberon:**
He wants the Calamity to occur, but he also wants his Vault Fortress to remain safe at all costs.

**Oberon:**
That's where he keeps all the treasure he collects, after all.

**Oberon:**
He claims that it won't be destroyed by the Calamity, but it seems he still wants some insurance.

**Oberon:**
In the worst case, he'll let Mash...the Child of Prophecy, protect his castle.

**Gareth:**
That's not really my idea of a great clan head.

**Gareth:**
Once, I would have thought he needed to suffer some and reflect on his actions...at least, that's what I would have thought.

**Oberon:**
I fully agree. As such, let's make protecting Norwich our top priority for now.

**Oberon:**
The city of Norwich remaining safe&mdash;that will deal the biggest blow to Spriggan.

**Oberon:**
After all, it's not difficult to imagine what will happen to a disliked lord who can't get his valued land back once the new year comes, is it?

**Gareth:**
Ah! I get it!

**Oberon:**
That's all I had to share. I'm sorry I couldn't figure out more.

**Da Vinci:**
Don't say that. The information about the Queen's army not having moved yet is valuable enough on its own.

**Da Vinci:**
We'll be able to focus on the issues at hand in Norwich. First, we'll investigate the rain clouds in the sky&mdash;

**Norwich Military Police:**
There's an emergency, Count Peperon!

**Norwich Military Police:**
A massive number of Mors have emerged from the sea, and are moving into the residential district!

**Norwich Military Police:**
More than a thousand of them! &mdash;The Calamity, it has begun!

**Norwich Military Police:**
Those who own houses, remain indoors! If you go outside, the Mors will kill you!

**Norwich Military Police:**
Those with no homes, evacuate to the shelter, hurry now!

**Norwich Military Police:**
Shit, more of them...! Where the hell are these things&mdash;

**Fairy Opening Shop:**
Whaaaaaa! Don't come near, don't come near!

**Mors:**
[[File:Npc_language_1.png|200px]]

**Mors:**
[[File:Npc_language_1.png|200px]]

**Fairy Opening Shop:**
Heeeee! They're everywhere, everywhere! Help me, help meeee!

**Fairy Opening Shop:**
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared&mdash;! Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me...!

**Fairy Opening Shop:**
What the hell is this, it hurts, it hurts, it huuuuuuurts! Aa, aaaa, aaaaaa....!

**Norwich Military Police:**
What the hell was that just now? The Mors devoured that fairy whole and grew in size...!?

**Norwich Military Police:**
I've never heard of such a thing happening... No, this time it's the Calamity...

**Norwich Military Police:**
Alright, report to the Count! “We cannot hold our position. We must withdraw!”

**Norwich Military Police:**
“The hostile Mors are growing as they feed on fairies! Human soldiers will face huge issues trying to take them on!”

**Norwich Military Police:**
Quickly now, at this rate the northern district will fall in no time! Focus on evacuating the residents of the southern ward only!

**Norwich Military Police:**
That was all the squad leader had to report! Please provide evacuation advisory to leave the city, Count!

**Count Peperon:**
Hm, I thought we'd have more time, but this is just the way the cookie crumbles, I guess.

**Count Peperon:**
Seeeeeriously, the more unpleasant things happen at an unpleasant timing, the more it all becomes unpleasant.

**O：Norwich Military Police:**
My...Count?

**Count Peperon:**
Calm yourself, I haven't lost my mind. &mdash;What will you do if I give order to evacuate the city?

**Count Peperon:**
Spriggan's soldiers have most likely closed the gates by this point. They want the fairies to succumb, after all.

**Count Peperon:**
Escort the citizens to the evacuation shelters we prepared. Have the military police withdraw to the shelter as well.

**Count Peperon:**
You, the human soldiers, will protect the citizens and hold the Mors off at the port.

**Count Peperon:**
Your priority should be to safeguard the people. Do not make the mistake of thinking you can fight the Mors.

**O：Norwich Military Police:**
But, if we don't deal with the Mors, the shelter will fall&mdash;

**Count Peperon:**
You're right. But that's why they are here. Isn't that so, Child of Prophecy and company?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, leave it to us!|


---

**O：Norwich Military Police:**
Ah! So that one is the Child of Prophecy!

**O：Norwich Military Police:**
Rather ordinary, but she seems good to me!

**Artoria:**
Ah...ahaha, yeah. I appreciate your honesty, thank you.

**Gareth:**
W-wait a minute, this...I don't know about this.

**Gareth:**
We're going up against Mors. Fairies don't stand a chance.

**Gareth:**
...I cannot even imagine what it would take for us to win. I think we have to retreat here and wait for things to...

**Oberon:**
Hey. That's not something the courageous Gareth would say.

**Oberon:**
The Mors may be the natural enemy of fairies, but that doesn't mean you can't fight.

**Oberon:**
Artoria can backup Muramasa and da Vinci from the backlines.

**Oberon:**
We also have Fujimaru's summoning technique. We'll be able to drive off at least some of the Mors.

**Oberon:**
What do you say, Artoria? You came here to save Norwich.

**Oberon:**
Whatever the Calamity is, it's something you need to confront in order for your story to begin.

**Artoria:**
O-of course! Leave it to me!

**Artoria:**
And don't worry about the Mors! My body won't corrupt even if I come into contact with them!

**Gareth:**
Is that so!? In that case&mdash;yeah, we can do it!

**Count Peperon:**
It's decided, then. You will hold off the Mors on the street in the southern district.

**Count Peperon:**
I will need to remain in command here, so I cannot accompany you.

**Count Peperon:**
Hold them off for one hour, and that should be enough time to evacuate the entire southern district.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger that!|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go, Artoria!


---

**Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:**
Waa...waaa...

**Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:**
I shouldn't have come to check on the shop... shouldn't have come to check on the plantation with all this rain pouring...

**Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:**
Completely surrounded...they're gonna find me, unless...

**Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:**
Help me...help me...help me...Lady Savior... Lady Tonelico...

**Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:**
The fairies of my previous generation, and the one before that, and the one before that all spent their time making worthless shoes in Norwich...

**Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:**
They even made shoes for Lady Tonelico, or at least that's how legend has it...

**Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:**
So please save me...spare me...spare me...ah, why do the Mors seem frightened...?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There, a shoemaker fairy!|


---

**Artoria:**
Stay where you are! We'll take care of the Mors!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Artoria:**
Now or never! Quickly, get to the Count's shelter!

**Shoemaker Fairy:**
You s-s-saved me! Thank you, girl with the staff!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Gareth, you have good vision, right? Can you see what the harbor's like!?

**Gareth:**
Eh...!?

**Gareth:**
Y-yes, I see it! A swarm of Mors are coming from the harbor!

**Gareth:**
30...60...more than 100! Ah, they split up! Half of them are going elsewhere!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Towards the northern district!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(What do we do...split up...!?)


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
We can't save them, abandon the thought! If we lose even one man here, we're all dead!

**Senji Muramasa:**
You felt the power of the Mors just now, we all know it!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;but&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I know that...but, still...!)


---

**Senji Muramasa:**
Good grief, you don't know when to give up, do you, {(M) boy /(F) girl}? Screw it, use a Command Spell on me!

**Senji Muramasa:**
If I'm strengthened, I should be able to hold them off on my own! This is where I'll retire from here, then!

**Senji Muramasa:**
It's a poor end to our agreement, but it's better than being wiped out because we're being burdened by our thoughts!

**Artoria:**
Eh&mdash;hold on, it's not that easy,

**Oberon:**
No, that won't be necessary! Look, something's kicking up dust in the northern district!

**Gareth:**
That's the Child of Prophecy in black armor!

**Gareth:**
She jumped from the castle's bell tower and is kicking Mors left and right!

**Gareth:**
Amazing, amazing! Ah, it seems she's all alone, that can't be good!

**Gareth:**
But still, she isn't losing! She'll be able to handle the Mors in the northern district!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash...!|


---

**Oberon:**
Yeah, I guess Spriggan's little lies didn't work on that girl.

**Oberon:**
If she can hold down the northern district, then it'll be fine! We just have to keep defending the south!

**Oberon:**
Everyone, this is our moment of truth! This is when we stand to defend Norwich!

**Gareth:**
Yes, we won't lose to that Child of Prophecy over there!

**Gareth:**
We will stand our ground here, and let everyone see that Artoria is the real thing!

**Artoria:**
...

**--BATTLE--:**

**Senji Muramasa:**
How many are there now!? They just keep coming! I'm not even gonna count past fifty!

**Senji Muramasa:**
We're about to fall apart over here, how about you!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;, &mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Still, somehow...!


---

**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru!? Hold on, take a deep breath!

**Da Vinci:**
You're relying too heavily on your Mystic Code! You're exceeding the limits of your Magical Energy Life-Force Conversion!

**Da Vinci:**
You need to get back and rest! Immediate administration of active ampoule!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger... that...!|


---

**Gareth:**
There's another swarm of Mors coming in from the harbour! No way...there are probably over 500 of them! No, even more!

**Senji Muramasa:**
That bastard's finally pulled the trigger. Da Vinci-chan, how's our time!?

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, we made it! About an hour!

**Da Vinci:**
There aren't any residents left to evacuate, so we should retreat to the shelter!

**Gareth:**
...Huh? That's not...those aren't Mors...

**Gareth:**
They're fae...they're coming from over there... they were hiding in that building.

**Gareth:**
Are they fleeing this way? Why? They were safe inside&mdash;

**Gareth:**
&mdash; What? Huh?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gareth...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's happening at the harbour...?


---

**Gareth:**
&mdash; Uh. Ugh, buh...!

**Artoria:**
Gareth!?

**Oberon:**
She's just frightened. She's not hurt! It's because she was looking directly at that thing!

**Oberon:**
It seems to be causing mental disruptions in fairies!

**Oberon:**
Even the fairies that were hiding in the harbor district are fleeing here in panic!

**Da Vinci:**
That's not good. We can't fit all those people in the shelter!

**Senji Muramasa:**
We've got an even bigger problem. If that thing touches ground, the entire city itself will be destroyed!

**Da Vinci:**
Can that thing move!? No, of course it can, it just came out here!

**Da Vinci:**
Is this what they call the Calamity!? Then, what's with the rain clouds in the sky!?

**Senji Muramasa:**
We can think about that later, da Vinci! Artoria, Fujimaru, what's the plan?

**Senji Muramasa:**
Earlier, we decided to ignore the northern district, but that's no longer feasible.

**Senji Muramasa:**
We can stay here and go down with Norwich, or we can prioritise our own lives.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Those are the only two options, there's no other way. &mdash;If we hurry, we can still make it out.

**Senji Muramasa:**
You get it, right? Your job is to cleanse the Calamity, protecting Norwich is just a bonus.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Think about it from that perspective.

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...(I get it too. We have no chance of winning...)


---

**Oberon:**
I know how you feel, but we have to retreat now! We couldn't win even if you could fight properly!

**Oberon:**
Let's withdraw for the time being, and figure out the Calamity's weak spot!

**Oberon:**
It's not your fault Norwich is going to fall, this is just the way things have to be!

**Artoria:**
That...may be so...but...we'll take that thing down somehow&mdash;

**Artoria:**
Take it down&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are you seeing...?


---

**Castoria Monologue:**
&mdash;Faintly.

**Castoria Monologue:**
I awoke to the sound of a bell ringing out, far away.

**Castoria Monologue:**
When I woke up in my warm bed, I had a clear premonition.

**Castoria Monologue:**
“Perhaps today, the Calamity will come.”

**Castoria Monologue:**
I would always wake up to the sound of bells. Suddenly, a storm would arrive without warning.

**Castoria Monologue:**
It was the same in Tintagel.

**Castoria Monologue:**
It was an ordinary morning, but that day was the end of my normal routines to come.

**Artoria:**
...No way...I'm not confident enough...

**Castoria Monologue:**
Thanks to everyone else, I've gotten better, but it's still unreasonable.

**Castoria Monologue:**
I lack confidence. I lack strength. I lack qualifications. Saving Britain is still but a dream.

**Castoria Monologue:**
Shall I run away? That is what I think every time I wake up.

**Castoria Monologue:**
But I am the Child of Prophecy. That is who I was raised to be.

**Castoria Monologue:**
Everyone in the village saw me off with that expectation, even at the cost of their own lives.

**Castoria Monologue:**
That is why I have to do my best. I have to overcome the weakness inside me.

**Castoria Monologue:**
&mdash;To be honest, I don't really care about anything else.

**Castoria Monologue:**
But I absolutely won't betray that star. Not a chance.

**Castoria Monologue:**
Ah&mdash;but this is impossible. It is simply impossible. I know it is.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Those are the only two options, there's no other way. &mdash;If we hurry, we can still make it out.

**Castoria Monologue:**
I can run. That's what everyone is saying. No one will blame me for running here.

**Castoria Monologue:**
They will only be disappointed, that's all.

**Castoria Monologue:**
You can always make up for disappointments. You can always be forgiven through further achievements.

**Castoria Monologue:**
So I wanted to tell them we would run away, but I am surprised at how I was so hesitant to say so.

**Castoria Monologue:**
“I want to run. I can't do it. I'm scared. No, but... but... but...”

**Castoria Monologue:**
When I look to my side, there {(M) he /(F) she} is, looking up at that thing with the same face as me.

**Castoria Monologue:**
Fujimaru is the same as me.

**Castoria Monologue:**
Forced to do things we cannot possibly do. Sent into battles we don't have the strength to fight.

**Castoria Monologue:**
And yet we cannot turn it down, so here we stand.

**Castoria Monologue:**
Then I'll be the first to say, it's okay to run.

**Castoria Monologue:**
That's right. I chose in {(M) his /(F) her} stead. I was about to tell them all we should run away for {(M) his /(F) her} sake.

**Castoria Monologue:**
Then I saw that figure.

**Castoria Monologue:**
A star pushing their way through the crowd, rushing toward the Calamity.

**Castoria Monologue:**
Running straight at that thing with firm determination, having swallowed their fear.

**Narration:**
The image of the other Child of Prophecy. And so...

**Narration:**
Seeing this, power returned to Fujimaru's eyes.

**Oberon:**
...Mash...what a shame. Didn't she have any friends around who could stop her?

**Oberon:**
But it can't be helped...she's already a “Child of Prophecy”.

**Oberon:**
This is what the people around her wished for, and what she has chosen to do.

**Oberon:**
I guess dying here is the story she has chosen to tell.

**Oberon:**
Fujimaru...I don't really know how to say this, but...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Hold the fort here!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll be going, da Vinci!


---

**Oberon:**
What the hell!?

**Da Vinci:**
What are you saying!? I'm coming with you! Oberon! Take care of evacuating the fairies, please!

**Oberon:**
&mdash;Amazing. I didn't expect this kind of development...

**Oberon:**
It's alright, you should go! Sometimes brute courage is what's needed!

**Oberon:**
I believe in the power of you Chaldeans, after all, you've made it this far!

**Da Vinci:**
That giant, it's descending towards the harbour! That's an amazing way to attack. Or maybe it's prostrating!?

**Da Vinci:**
Either way, it'll completely annihilate the harbour! Fujimaru, is there anything on your mind!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where did Mash go!?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
She's already at the pier! She's deploying her Round Shield!

**Da Vinci:**
She's going to take that thing on by herself! Even Mash can't handle that kind of mass!

**Da Vinci:**
Here's my suggestion as your technical advisor: “if you turn back now, you can save yourself, Fujimaru!”

**Da Vinci:**
Is there really any reason for you to win this fight!?

**Oberon:**
So&mdash;is there a need for you to care?

**Oberon:**
If Mash will never remember you? If she will never return to being the girl you once knew?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That&mdash;|


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;is why!|


---

**Narration:**
&mdash;Now then, let's resume her story for just a moment.

**Narration:**
“If you do as I say, the other chiefs will never know. I can keep you hidden, even from the Queen's eyes.”

**Narration:**
Those were the silver-tongued words of Spriggan, which had not sat right with her.

**Narration:**
When she found out that the Mors had appeared, she did not bother with the heavily guarded ground floor exit.

**Narration:**
She climbed up the castle's bell tower, and jumped down into Norwich without hesitation!

**Narration:**
With a thunderous roar, a thunderous boom, and thunderous movement! No, thunderous movement isn't quite right, that was simply gravity at work.

**Narration:**
Once down in the city of Norwich, she attracted the horde of Mors and evacuated the fairies to safety.

**Narration:**
Then came the big one. The cursed hand of ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ rose from the sea.

**Narration:**
As one would expect, she stumbled at the sight, but when she saw the screaming fairies, she pulled herself together.

**Narration:**
She rushed into the harbour without hesitation and confronted the cursed hand at the end of the pier.

**Mash:**
(This is&mdash;)

**Narration:**
She realised at once that she could not stop it on her own. Even if she gave everything she had, she could not stop the inevitable destruction.

**Mash:**
Even so&mdash;!

**Narration:**
Even so, she could mitigate some of the damage.

**Narration:**
Even though the harbor would be destroyed, the damage could be lessened somewhat, and the residential district might be saved.

**Narration:**
That prospect was enough for her, and when she deployed her shield, she saw something unbelievable.

**Mash:**
That...person&mdash;

**Narration:**
Running into the harbour was the human she had met at the square.

**Narration:**
An inexplicable surge of joy and relief overflooded her heart, and so she could not help but raise her voice.

**Mash:**
Run away! Don't come over here! I can't hold it off for more than a few more seconds...!

**Narration:**
But her desperate shouting did not prevent the human's approach.

**Narration:**
Could {(M) he /(F) she} not hear her hesitant voice over the shield clashing against the curse?

**Narration:**
Unbelievably, {(M) he /(F) she} ran across the pier with a voice louder than even hers, shouting “I'm not gonna let you lose!”

**Narration:**
{(M) His /(F) Her} hand touched her back, as if to support her. As if to tell her that {(M) he /(F) she} would not leave her side.

**Mash:**
Ah&mdash;

**Narration:**
That concern for her filled her with so much joy, and she finally remembered being human.

**Narration:**
Indeed, and because she was human, she felt the pain, and the fear.

**Narration:**
The fear that she would let those who believed in her be hurt.

**Mash:**
I'm the Child of Prophecy, leave me be...! I'll be fine, just run away&mdash;!

**Narration:**
And so she held on strong until the very end. Saying it would be all right, like a child telling a lie they knew were poor.

**Fujimaru:**
I proclaim through my Command Spell!

**Mash:**
Eh&mdash;?

**Fujimaru:**
I don't care whether you're the Child of Prophecy or not&mdash;

**Narration:**
The voice resounded from behind her. From her heart to her fingertips, her fiery blood pumped throughout her body.

**Fujimaru:**
Mash, give us all a show we'll never forget!!!

**Narration:**
With this, the Prophecy had been overturned.

**Narration:**
Even Ainsel's own premonition could not have foretold this scene.

**Mash:**
(Ah&mdash;I get it now. I'll do that, Master.)

**Narration:**
The chalk wall repelled the cursed hand. That thing could not stand against the walls of Camelot.

**Narration:**
The thing recognized the creature in front of itself as its enemy, attempting to thwart the collapse.

**Narration:**
Something that would prevent the Calamity. A small-scale adversary, standing there to save the Fairy Kingdom.

**Fujimaru:**
You're doing it, Mash! Push it back!

**Narration:**
The familiar voice awakened what resided within her. It was neither Annis nor the Child of Prophecy that was found there.

**Narration:**
It was the knight who had inherited the holy shield. A servant of Chaldea. Indeed.

**Mash:**
Yes, Master!

**Mash:**
Please lend me your strength! I'll do everything I can to purge this place of the Calamity!

**Mash:**
Because&mdash;because! I may not be the Child of Prophecy, but even so...!

**Mash:**
My heart! It's crying out to protect this city!

**Narration:**
That girl's name is Mash Kyrielight.

**Narration:**
She, who everyone had believed to be the Child of Prophecy, was finally allowed to be selfish.

**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
No way...the Calamity is vanishing...

**Mash:**
...We did it. We did it, we really did it, Senpai!

**Mash:**
Amazing, we really managed to beat the Calamity!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You did it, Mash!|


---

**Mash:**
Ah...yes. T-this isn't the time to rejoice, though...

**Mash:**
Mash Kyrielight has returned. I apologize for any inconvenience I've caused.

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Welcome back, Mash. We're so glad you made it back safe.

**Da Vinci:**
I'm sure you've got a story to tell, but we'll get to that once we're settled in.

**Da Vinci:**
We have a local associate you'd probably like to meet. Or should I say, “companion”?

**Da Vinci:**
Oh, here she comes. Hey, over here, over here!

**Da Vinci:**
Let me introduce you. This is Mash, Fujimaru's main servant.

**Da Vinci:**
Mash, this is Artoria Caster. She's Fujimaru's owner.

**Da Vinci:**
She is the King Arthur of this Lostbelt, the Child of Prophecy, and a powerful magus.

**Artoria:**
Eh&mdash;nononono, I'm not that strong or King Arthur or the Child of Prophecy or...

**Artoria:**
I'm so embarrassed that you would say that in front of the likes of the incredibly strong Mash, I could just die...

**Artoria:**
I'm sorry that I couldn't lift a finger to help you out of the Nameless Forest,

**Artoria:**
I'm sorry that I couldn't be of any help against the Calamity, I'm so sorry that I'm so weak...!

**Mash:**
A-Artoria...! But you're the real Child of Prophecy...!

**Mash:**
No, no, no, what am I saying! I should apologize for introducing myself as the Child of Prophecy! I was just trying to comprehend what you meant when you said Senpai's “owner”, and then my mind went completely blank but then I realized da Vinci, that pain in the butt, was using it as a distraction to hide the fact that Senpai is a human from Chaldea!

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

**Mash:**
&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They hit it off just like that!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
All thanks to da Vinci-chan...I guess?


---

**Da Vinci:**
Nuh-uh, it's the high spirits!

**Da Vinci:**
I knew you two would hit it off, even though you are so different!

**Da Vinci:**
Well, then. “Cleanse the Calamity” and “Meet up with Mash”.

**Da Vinci:**
We've completed those two things in one go, but there's still one more thing we need to do in Norwich.

**Da Vinci:**
Indeed, the Pilgrim's Bell. Now that we're here, why don't we ring it?

**Artoria:**
That's...a little...I couldn't do something like that...

**Artoria:**
It was Mash and Fujimaru who drove back the Calamity.

**Artoria:**
I don't think I'm qualified to ring the bell right now...

**Mash:**
That's not true.

**Mash:**
I'm sure you tried to protect Norwich as best as you could.

**Mash:**
It was just a coincidence that I was the one who managed to drive back the Calamity.

**Mash:**
Just because I did that, doesn't mean I'm the Child of Prophecy.

**Mash:**
I just did it because it's what I wanted. I'm no different than you, Artoria.

**Mash:**
So please, ring the Pilgrim's Bell. I'll have a talk with Spriggan myself.

**Artoria:**
I s-see!

**Artoria:**
You're a good person, Mash!

**Artoria:**
From what Fujimaru told me, this isn't how I pictured you.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Is that the sound of rain?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...By the way, the Calamity Pool is still there...


---

**Da Vinci:**
You're right. We repelled the Calamity, so why are those clouds still&mdash;

**Mash:**
Everyone, look out&mdash;!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Mash?|


---

**Da Vinci:**
Oww...I was sent flying like a ball...

**Da Vinci:**
Huh? Mash?

**Artoria:**
&mdash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Mash...is gone&mdash;|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash. Mash...!


---

**???:**
Ah, you saw it happen right in front of you, so don't you get it? She was protecting you, and now she's gone.

**???:**
That right there was Morgan's Water Mirror. Originally, it was supposed to be used against the Calamity.

**???:**
It was such a flashy plot twist, but it's taken a long time to set up.

**???:**
Seriously, you outsider humans are so careless. Or were you led wherever the wind took you?

**???:**
Well, it doesn't matter either way. It doesn't change what I have to do.

**???:**
Come now, this is no time to be falling on your ass, Fujimaru.

**???:**
Don't fret, Mash is fine. She's just not here.

**???:**
The Water Mirror is a transference spell. She's somewhere else in Britain by now.

**???:**
Don't worry. You'll be reunited before long. If you don't, I'll be upset.

**???:**
When that time comes, the bride's prince will have to rise up as graceful as ever.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who are you...!?|


---

**G：???:**
Ooh, you've got spirit, don't you? You've just barely made it out.

**G：???:**
Pleased to meet you, Chaldeans. I am Habetrot.

**Habetrot:**
I am... Well, let's just say I'm like Mash's personal assistant.

**Habetrot:**
A friendly fae who will help you out on your journey, free of charge.

**Habetrot:**
That is, until you're reunited with Mash, at least. You should feel honored!

**--ARROW--:**

**Habetrot:**
Whaa, the food here is too delicious! The stuff back at Sheffield has nothing on this!

**Habetrot:**
Ah, is that pasta? Is that what you call it? Can I have some more? It's so fun to twirl!

**Red Rabbit:**
M-hay I have another slice of the carrot-colored cake, or perhaps another two?

**Red Rabbit:**
I went around the river and hurried to Norwich, only to find that everything is already over...

**Red Rabbit:**
If I don't suppress this heartbreak with things of sweet nature, there is no way I will be able to go back to pulling that carriage.

**Count Peperon:**
It's a good thing you were able to save Norwich. And without pause we have gained several more odd companions, it seems?

**Count Peperon:**
However, the situation has grown somewhat complicated.

**Count Peperon:**
You were able to reunite with Mash, but were immediately separated again.

**Count Peperon:**
And outside&mdash;

**Fairies Gathering Outside:**
Child of Prophecy! Child of Prophecy!

**Fairies Gathering Outside:**
The Child of Prophecy saved Norwich! The Child of Prophecy will defeat the Queen!

**Fairies Gathering Outside:**
We are no longer at Morgan's mercy!

**Fairies Gathering Outside:**
The Child of Prophecy saved us! It is time for us to return the favor!

**Fairies Gathering Outside:**
Route all weapon shipments to Londinium! Stop all deliveries to Camelot!

**Fairies Gathering Outside:**
Child of Prophecy! Child of Prophecy! Let's hear it for the true king of Britain!

**Gareth:**
We did it! This is a huge win for you, Artoria!

**Artoria:**
...

**Count Peperon:**
...It seems so. Perhaps a bit too huge. You protected Norwich without fault, and even managed to repel the Calamity.

**Count Peperon:**
But the fairies of Norwich are now devoting all their sympathies to the Child of Prophecy. With this, there is no way the Queen will sit idly by.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Her army will come. The Calamity has passed, but a war will soon break out between fairy soldiers.

**Gareth:**
Ah...I see, this will clearly turn into an insurrection...

**Da Vinci:**
I'm also concerned by Mash, who was spirited away by Morgan's Water Mirror.

**Da Vinci:**
And the fairies keep going on about how “there's no more danger” and “we'll all be able to reunite”.

**Habetrot:**
Right, right. Habenyan is out of ideas, too.

**Habetrot:**
However, I do know going on a desperate search right now would be a bad move. All good things must come to an end, inscrutable are the ways of heaven.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Habenyan? Is that what you're called? You're a bit of a proverbial fairy, aren't you...

**Count Peperon:**
Either way, for the time being, you shouldn't carelessly just rush outside.

**Count Peperon:**
If you do, it might further incite the fairies of Norwich to rebel against the Queen.

**Count Peperon:**
It would be best to sneak out of the city under the cover of night. That is, assuming you know where to go.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where to go...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Should we head back to Salisbury for now?


---

**Oberon:**
No. We managed to exorcise the Calamity and save Norwich.

**Oberon:**
We can't let this feat go to waste.

**Oberon:**
In the first place, we were never supposed to be allowed this opportunity. “The Calamity will be repelled, but Norwich will fall.”

**Oberon:**
That's part of the prophecy. I've kept it to myself until now.

**Count Peperon:**
...Then you will go to meet Spriggan? To have him compensate you for protecting Norwich.

**Oberon:**
Yeah. The fairies of Norwich will back us up against Spriggan.

**Oberon:**
“Let her ring the Pilgrim's Bell. The citizens of Norwich will break down your door if you don't!”

**Oberon:**
Stuff like that.

**Spriggan:**
I'll comply, of course! I wouldn't dare refuse the saviors of Norwich!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just like that!?|


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Huh? This fairy...

**Spriggan:**
What is it? Is there something on my face? Huh, there isn't. Then, shall we continue our conversation?


---

**Spriggan:**
The bell tower is just beyond here. As my loyalty still lies with Her Majesty the Queen, I cannot take you there myself, but...

**Spriggan:**
If you were to go and ring it on your own, I wouldn't be able to stop you.

**Spriggan:**
It would simply be my fault for being careless around you, that's all.

**Spriggan:**
She would be able to take such a thing into consideration.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Right, you're too scared of animosity from the public, after all.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Let's go up, Artoria. We'll ring it and get out of here.

**Senji Muramasa:**
...Artoria?

**Artoria:**
...I'm sorry. I can't ring the bell of Norwich.

**Artoria:**
To ring this bell would mean declaring war against Her Majesty Morgan.

**Artoria:**
...It isn't something I'm ready to do.

**Artoria:**
Not to mention...it was Mash who saved Norwich.

**Artoria:**
It wasn't me the people of Norwich hailed.

**Spriggan:**
Ho-ho. Well, well.

**Spriggan:**
Someone with an eye for the times, huh? I'm quite impressed.

**Spriggan:**
You're such a naive-looking thing, after all... Indeed, to ring the bell here would go against your morals.

**Spriggan:**
Unless of course, you would have armies march and further blood spill.

**Senji Muramasa:**
Ha? Why's that?

**Spriggan:**
Because there remain countless people loyal to Her Majesty the Queen.

**Spriggan:**
After all, she is the one who has protected Britain from the Mors for the past 2,000 years.

**Spriggan:**
Regardless of how despotic her rule might be, her accomplishments are rock-solid.

**Spriggan:**
Most would not go against someone like that just because it was “spoken of in a prophecy”.

**Spriggan:**
Who would be in the right? Who would hold the position of integrity?

**Spriggan:**
If they cannot answer that, the Child of Prophecy is nothing more than an invader...

**Spriggan:**
You would be barbarians, no different from the Saxons.

**Oberon:**
In other words, you're suggesting we send a message before we act? A declaration of our cause, and our denunciation of the Queen.

**Spriggan:**
Exactly. In fact, if you were to prepare such a thing, I would personally see that it was delivered to Her Majesty...

**Spriggan:**
Although there is no need for such things now. Just before, I was in conversation with Her Majesty.

**Spriggan:**
“In recognition of their good luck in saving Norwich, the Child of Prophecy and her foreign visitors are hereby invited to an audience with the Queen.”

**Spriggan:**
With cause of their unusual accomplishment, they will be treated as honored guests, and I will hear any proposal they put forth,“ she said.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(The Queen wants us to go meet her in person...!)


---

**Oberon:**
No way. If we go, we'll definitely be killed!

**Oberon:**
Did you really think we would fall for such a blatantly obvious trap, Morgan!?

**Spriggan:**
No, no. Her Majesty may be ruthless, but she abides by her decorum.

**Spriggan:**
As Her Majesty has stated that you shall be received as her guests, your safety is absolutely guaranteed.

**Spriggan:**
A ruler is one who stays true to their word, after all.

**Spriggan:**
How else could the six clans be consolidated?

**Senji Muramasa:**
...I see. Just like we require a declaration to start a war,

**Senji Muramasa:**
the Queen can't simply kill the Child of Prophecy without pretext.

**Senji Muramasa:**
In fact, that's how Norwich was saved.

**Senji Muramasa:**
As a political figurehead, she would need to prove to the people who is right and who is wrong.

**Senji Muramasa:**
In that case, it's just a matter of mutual questioning. To gauge the other party's worth.

**Da Vinci:**
I see it the same as Muramasa. Moreoever, I would really like to know more about the Queen.

**Da Vinci:**
So far, we only really know that her name is Morgan.

**Da Vinci:**
I want to question her myself, to confirm what it is she wants, what it is she desires.

**Da Vinci:**
However, I will only go if our safety both there and back will be guaranteed.

**Da Vinci:**
If antagonism arises during the audience, I need a promise that there will be a truce in place.

**Spriggan:**
Of course. All that has already been promised.

**Spriggan:**
All the details are in this letter. A copy has already been sent out to all the clan heads.

**Artoria:**
So, with all that...what do you think, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If she's this thorough, we'll face her.|


---

**Artoria:**
Why are you being so belligerent about this!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I mean, this means she has us cornered...|


---

**Artoria:**
Aa...what a grim face...

**Artoria:**
...Yeah. I get it. To be honest, I'm pretty pissed off as well.

**Artoria:**
What the hell does she mean, “lucky”?

**Artoria:**
We all worked so hard, Mash too! “Luck”, my ass!

**Oberon:**
I see. If everyone has made up their mind, I guess that will be our decision.

**Oberon:**
In this case, Artoria's decision to not want to ring the bell also makes sense.

**Oberon:**
If she rings the bell now, the Queen and Child of Prophecy would become political enemies.

**Oberon:**
In such a case, I imagine this invitation would become void, is that right, Spriggan?

**Spriggan:**
Who knows, I wouldn't be able to say.

**Spriggan:**
Oberon, was it? A troublesome fairy, aren't you? The kind not found in the Fairy Kingdom.

**Spriggan:**
I'll send a messenger to the Count's mansion first thing in the morning. Afterwards, I would like for you to meet up with the soldiers outside the city.

**Artoria:**
...Her Majesty's troops will escort us. Just in case, may I ask who will lead this escort?

**Spriggan:**
Of course. The unit sent will be the First Imperial Cavalry of the Mors Extermination Division. Their captain's name is Gawain.

**Spriggan:**
Indeed, our pride and joy, Fairy Knight Gawain will most definitely lead you safely to Camelot.

**Beryl:**
Huh? What was that? I couldn't quite hear you, Lady Spinel.

**Beryl:**
Could you repeat that, please? What was that about the black Child of Prophecy?

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I told you, she died in Norwich. She was struck by mother's Water Mirror.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Her body and armor both disappeared completely. There wasn't even a finger left.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's no surprise! She was surprisingly strong, but against my mother she couldn't last for a single second. Kyahaha!

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
She no longer has to suffer just on the inside.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Beryl? Hey, Beryl, what's wrong? Did I say something wrong?

**Beryl:**
&mdash;What's that? That's just hogwash.

**Beryl:**
That's just ordinary news, Lady Spinel. Your typical spread of misinformation. It's hardly even enough to call a joke.

**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
...? Mash, she was your sweetheart, wasn't she? She died, how's that ordinary news?

**Beryl:**
Mash simply DISAPPEARED, didn't she? If there's no body, that means she's alive.

**Beryl:**
In the first place&mdash;

**Beryl:**
I have to die first. Mash would never go and die before I do. Not a chance.

**Beryl:**
That's how the goddess of love made this world.

**Beryl:**
No matter what, Mash will always fall into my lap.

**Beryl:**
There might be ups and downs along the way, but it's bound to happen. Isn't that what being soulmates is all about?

## Prologue 
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Extra, extraaa! Extra from the deeeck! Da Vinci's Tifone has returned!
 
**Nemo:**
Good work. Have it rest in the cage until our reply is composed.
 
**Nemo:**
...It's cleared six different scans from the hazardous materials sensor. Musik, Holmes, Da Vinci's report is here.
 
**Holmes:**
Let's see. Hm...ah-hah...I see...so that's the situation...
 
**Holmes:**
Clan heads...the Calamity...a mysterious fairy horse called Red Rab-bit...
 
**Holmes:**
Quite a few more pieces of mind-blowing information. Mr. Gordolf, would you like to read it?
 
**Gordolf:**
Naturally. I'm Chaldea's commander. Looking over every report is my job.
 
**Gordolf:**
Captain, pot-au-feuniere, members of the Marines. I'm going to read this aloud, so I expect you to be quiet.
 
**Gordolf:**
Now, Britain, the Land of the Fey...
 
**Gordolf:**
The threat of the sixth Lostbelt, the Fairy Kingdom of Britain, which rejects the operation of all electronic devices inside it.
 
**Gordolf:**
Chaldea's special investigation operative and Master, Fujimaru,
 
**Gordolf:**
{(M)his/(F)her} exclusive Servant, Mash Kyrielight,
 
**Gordolf:**
technical advisor Leonardo da Vinci...along with the summoned Servant Tristan.
 
**Gordolf:**
Those four went ashore in Britain,
 
**Gordolf:**
to the Fairy Territory dubbed the “Nameless Forest”.
 
**Gordolf:**
As soon as they entered, they steadily lost their names and memories, and were separated due to the rules of that territory.
 
**Gordolf:**
Fujimaru woke up in a village in Cornwall,
 
**Gordolf:**
and came in contact with Artoria Caster, a local fairy who has since become an on-site collaborator.
 
**Gordolf:**
With help from Servant Tristan, they escaped from the Nameless Forest.
 
**Gordolf:**
With additional help from a new on-site local, Oberon, the so-called Fairy King,
 
**Gordolf:**
Fujimaru began the investigation in earnest.
 
**Gordolf:**
{(M)He/(F)She} was soon able to reunite with technical advisor Leonardo da Vinci,
 
**Gordolf:**
and while their highest priority was to find Mash Kyrielight, various information about the Fairy Kingdom was collected.
 
**Gordolf:**
The king of this Lostbelt is Queen Morgan, whose rule over the Fairy Kingdom has lasted for 2,000 years.
 
**Gordolf:**
The fairies are divided into six clans. Human existence is controlled by the fairies.
 
**Gordolf:**
The natural enemy of the fairies, known as the Mors. Fairy Knights who bear the names of Heroic Spirits from pan-human history.
 
**Gordolf:**
“Calamities” that occur every 100 years. “Great Calamities” that occur every 1,000 years.
 
**Gordolf:**
And...the one said to defeat Morgan, the “Child of Prophecy.”
 
**Gordolf:**
On a pilgrimage to ring the bells of the bell towers governed by the six clan heads.
 
**Gordolf:**
When this is successfully done, the Child of Prophecy will defeat Morgan and become the true king...
 
**Gordolf:**
There's no way Fujimaru would sit quietly by upon hearing such a story.
 
**Gordolf:**
{(M)He/(F)She} selfishly proposed cooperating with Artoria Caster without waiting for further instructions from me.
 
**Gordolf:**
For the sake of their mutual goal of defeating Morgan, they wholeheartedly supported the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Gordolf:**
Dialogue with Aurora, head of the Wind Clan. A chance meeting with the Fairy Knight Gawain at a human farm.
 
**Gordolf:**
An auction showdown with the Fairy Knight Tristan. The rescue of the Servant Muramasa, apostle of the Alien God.
 
**Gordolf:**
Dialogue with Muryan, head of the Wing Clan. Contact with Koyanskaya, in yet another new outfit.
 
**Gordolf:**
Joined by another local ally, the fairy Gareth. The mysterious fairy horse, Red Rab-bit.
 
**Gordolf:**
Through many dangers, including Dracae's river of tears,
 
**Gordolf:**
what Fujimaru saw when {(M)he/(F)she} arrived in Norwich was...
 
**Gordolf:**
Another Child of Prophecy supported by the fairies, none other than Mash Kyrielight!
 
**Gordolf:**
Urrrgh, I can't make heads or tails of this no matter how many times I read it over!
 
**Gordolf:**
Why is Kyrielight being held up as the Child of Prophecy!?
 
**Gordolf:**
And what the heck is a “Habenyan”!? This report alone gives me no idea!
 
**Gordolf:**
I guess I'll just fill in the gaps with my imagination.
 
**Gordolf:**
I would assume Kyrielight had been having a tough time as well.
 
**Gordolf:**
Was she helping people, no, fairies in the north perhaps?
 
**Gordolf:**
I suppose they were thanking her for being a hero.
 
**Gordolf:**
In addition, they made contact with a Crypter hiding out in Norwich, Peperoncino.
 
**Gordolf:**
And after all that, the Calamity finally broke out in Norwich.
 
**Gordolf:**
With the assistance of us Chaldeans, the Child of Prophecy successfully repelled the Calamity.
 
**Gordolf:**
However...
 
**Gordolf:**
After finally being able to rejoin the others, Mash Kyrielight was transported elsewhere by a mysterious phenomenon,
 
**Gordolf:**
and she was once again separated from Fujimaru...
 
**Gordolf:**
But there was no time to be sad.
 
**Gordolf:**
I'm sure that's what Fujimaru thought.
 
**Gordolf:**
After all, now, in accordance with our ultimate objective...
 
**Gordolf:**
{(M)He/(F)She} has received an invitation from Morgan, who holds the spear Rhongomyniad, a countermeasure against the Alien God.
 
**Gordolf:**
Camelot, the castle of King Arthur in pan-human history, and the castle of evil in the Fairyland Britain.
 
**Gordolf:**
Fujimaru, Da Vinci, Artoria, Gareth, Muramasa, and, uh...Habenyan?
 
**Gordolf:**
These six accepted Morgan's invitation, and will depart for Camelot tomorrow morning!
 
**Gordolf:**
That's all the explanation that can be given. Was it not a good review, gentlemen?
 
**Nemo Marine:**
I think we got it! Thank you! Now we're going back to our posts!
 
**Meunière:**
...We've gone and stepped in it again...I hope Mash is all right...
 
**Holmes:**
There's nothing foreboding in Da Vinci's report. We can be assured that Mash is at least safe.
 
**Holmes:**
The problem is Morgan's magecraft, the “Water Mirror.”
 
**Holmes:**
...As far as I can tell from the material sent to me separately, it's...
 
**Gordolf:**
The dark clouds shrouding Norwich were not the “Calamity Pool,” but Morgan's magecraft.
 
**Gordolf:**
To perform such large-scale magecraft from somewhere over a hundred kilometers away...
 
**Gordolf:**
Queen Morgan. It must be said she's a terribly strong opponent, comparable to the Lostbelt Kings we've faced up to this point.
 
**Nemo:**
...I'm not familiar with Morgan's legend. Sorry, but could you tell me about her?
 
**Meunière:**
Is the pan-human history version fine? Then let's start with the basics.
 
**Meunière:**
In English folklore she was referred to as the “good lake fairy”.
 
**Meunière:**
But after the Arthurian legend was compiled, she was instead considered to be an evil woman who opposed King Arthur.
 
**Meunière:**
Morgan was the child of the Lord of Tintagel and Igraine,
 
**Meunière:**
and later became King Arthur's older sister when her mother married King Uther.
 
**Meunière:**
However, her jealousy of King Arthur lead her to perform many evil deeds.
 
**Meunière:**
Stealing the sheath of the holy sword, seducing Lancelot, but more importantly than all of that...
 
**Meunière:**
She had intercourse with King Arthur, bore him an illegitimate son, Mordred, and sent him to the Round Table.
 
**Meunière:**
There are many factors that led to the downfall of King Arthur's kingdom, but it was definitely Morgan who gave it the final push.
 
**Holmes:**
On the other hand, Morgan had a side to her that protected King Arthur...or so you could say.
 
**Holmes:**
She's seen as one with Viviane, the Lady of the Lake who granted King Arthur the holy sword and guarded him after his death.
 
**Nemo:**
...a siren driven by her lust for power, huh?
 
**Nemo:**
What's the general opinion of her in the world of magecraft? There's got to be more to it.
 
**Gordolf:**
Hm. Ever since I received the technical advisor's first report, I've been poring over data in the Border in search of anything.
 
**Gordolf:**
First of all, her very birth lacked normalcy.
 
**Gordolf:**
Morgan was not a daughter of Tintagel, but was born after Igraine married King Uther.
 
**Gordolf:**
She was merely the daughter of the ruler of Tintagel in appearance, but had the blood of the rightful king, Uther.
 
**Gordolf:**
...What's more, Morgan was not human.
 
**Gordolf:**
She was a fairy child...the spawn of the island itself. The same as the Vile King, Vortigern.
 
**Gordolf:**
Morgan concealed this fact and was brought up as a human child.
 
**Gordolf:**
Until a rightful heir to Uther was born, she would have inherited his rule.
 
**Gordolf:**
But then that very rightful heir appeared.
 
**Gordolf:**
Artoria... Since the time when King Arthur was recognized by the holy sword and brought the lords together, Morgan's power had been considerable...
 
**Gordolf:**
She began to conceal the very Mystery of the fairies itself, and corrupted Camelot at every opportunity.
 
**Gordolf:**
“Artoria is no more than a king created by the machinations of humans.”
 
**Gordolf:**
“I am the heir to the Mysteries of Great Britain, I am the true king.”
 
**Gordolf:**
Morgan never failed to believe that, and eventually came to despise her father, King Uther, and her sister Artoria.
 
**Gordolf:**
She hated all those who disobeyed her, and she was a major player in the fall of Britain.
 
**Gordolf:**
Why did King Arthur's dear sister Morgan assault Camelot in her later years?
 
**Gordolf:**
The reason appears to be something like that.
 
**Meunière:**
Yes. She schemed to overthrow the faraway Camelot while serving as the queen of the lands of Orkney.
 
**Meunière:**
Four of the Knights of the Round Table, Gawain, Gaheris, Gareth, and Agravain were Morgan's children.
 
**Meunière:**
Mordred was...well, I'm sure we would have a problem if the person in question was here, but...she was a homunculus made by Morgan...
 
**Meunière:**
Possibly a clone of King Arthur, or so some experts have come to believe.
 
**Nemo:**
...Despite some minor differences, the fact that Morgan is an adversary of King Arthur,
 
**Nemo:**
and the fact that she's the witch who destroyed Britain—those are constants, aren't they?
 
**Nemo:**
So where does the part where she “protected King Arthur” come in?
 
**Holmes:**
A good question, Captain.
 
**Holmes:**
In many legends, Morgan takes on multiple roles.
 
**Holmes:**
“The good sister of King Arthur,” “the Lady of the Lake,”  “the goddess spoken of since ancient Britain.”
 
**Holmes:**
These are three different roles.
 
**Holmes:**
Common sense would dictate that one of them is correct, and the other two represent different beings.
 
**Holmes:**
But&mdash;I believe that all three of them are the truth. Morgan had a threefold personality.
 
**Holmes:**
Because of her supernatural birth,
 
**Holmes:**
what it means to be a human, fairy and the personification of Britain,
 
**Holmes:**
were all intermingled within her. It is impossible to balance three different roles like that.
 
**Holmes:**
If that is the case, she may have three personalities&mdash;perhaps each independent from the other.
 
**Holmes:**
Morgan, Artoria's good sister, the way she lived as a human.
 
**Holmes:**
The way she lived as a fairy, as the Lady of the Lake, Viviane.
 
**Holmes:**
The way she lived as the incarnation of Britain, Morgan le Fey.
 
**Holmes:**
If you think of it that way, it's all consistent.
 
**Holmes:**
The Knights of the Round Table did not attack Morgan because she was both good and evil.
 
**Nemo:**
I understand. That satisfies my curiosity.
 
**Nemo:**
...Huh? By Viviane, do you mean Nimue? That's the alias of the fairy who imprisoned Merlin, isn't it?
 
**Holmes:**
Yes. Morgan is the natural enemy of Merlin as well as King Arthur's longtime rival.
 
**Holmes:**
Viviane hated her own magecraft teacher, Merlin, because of their love affair, and so she sealed him away.
 
**Holmes:**
The magic sarcophagus inscribed with “only the innocent shall pass”...the great Bounded Field that imprisoned even the incubus Merlin.
 
**Holmes:**
A magecraft from the Age of Gods called the “Garden”, unable to be handled by anyone but the embodiment of Mystery.
 
**Holmes:**
It's unknown how similar the Lostbelt Morgan is to the pan-human history one&mdash;
 
**Holmes:**
I suppose we should be looking at more than just Rhongomyniad.
 
**Meunière:**
...Huh. So first the Lion King in Jerusalem, and now Morgan in the Fairy Kingdom?
 
**Meunière:**
How much influence does the legend of King Arthur have on us anyway? It's only natural since we're in Britain now, but come on!
 
**Meunière:**
If it goes as far as Albion showing up, we're screwed! Can the Storm Border even win against that!?
 
**Nemo:**
Albion?
 
**Holmes:**
The name of this island before “Britain”, given by a previous civilization.
 
**Holmes:**
...Though in the world of magecraft, that name has a different meaning.
 
**Holmes:**
The last pure-blooded dragon, Albion.
 
**Holmes:**
A Phantasmal Beast that remained in Britain despite the end of the Age of Gods, yet died out in the end.
 
**Holmes:**
What we call “dragons” are the result of the “dragon factor” left behind by dragonkind after they migrated to the Reverse Side of the World,
 
**Holmes:**
and has become nothing more than “dragon territories” while maintaining their own territories.
 
**Holmes:**
Pureblood dragons no longer exist on this planet. Save for Albion's corpse, that is.
 
**Gordolf:**
Indeed, that's what they say in the Clock Tower! It's good to dream big!
 
**Gordolf:**
But a dream is still just a dream. Albion is just another one of those tall tales.
 
**Gordolf:**
More importantly, it's finally been 28 days.
 
**Gordolf:**
The concentrated fruit juice extract the technical advisor sent gives us some spare magical energy resource.
 
**Gordolf:**
The time we can stay here has been extended past the original 50 days. Shouldn't we call them back temporarily?
 
**Nemo:**
...Mm, perhaps. It would have been ideal to complete the mission in 30 days, but...
 
**Nemo:**
Nonetheless, we don't know when the “Collapse” will start. It's best to not alter the established time limit.
 
**Nemo:**
17 days left on the schedule. Is there any chance of the mission completing in that time, Holmes?
 
**Holmes:**
...According to Da Vinci's report, the situation is in hand, so we should see it that way.
 
**Holmes:**
If their audience with Queen Morgan ends peacefully, and they get information about Rhongomyniad,
 
**Holmes:**
the only thing remaining would be to set aside time for an investigation into the Collapse.
 
**Nemo:**
...And if it doesn't end peacefully?
 
**Holmes:**
As long as Chaldea is working with the Child of Prophecy, war is inevitable.
 
**Holmes:**
We have a good grasp of the Fairy Kingdom's military strength. After Artoria completes her pilgrimage,
 
**Holmes:**
if we can bring together the rebelling factions, the battle for Camelot can be settled in a single day.
 
**Holmes:**
...Probably. At minimum, it will take 18 days to bring everything to a close. Just barely within our acceptable limits.
 
## Section 10: Camelot 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You can hear the song of the Child of Prophecy from the main street.
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“From now, I will tell you of a future. The future of the mystical island which became the land of fairies.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“The innocent shall return. To the Queen's castle, bottomless as it is.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“Accumulating, accumulating; like rain, like ashes. Fading away, fading away; like snow, like the unbelievable.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“Our hopes are at the ledge; still held within the palm of the queen's hand.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“Yet we must only endure a short time more. The morning when two thousand years have passed, the child of salvation will appear.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“They who unites fairies and humans, us and them. The child of salvation who will save the world.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“Like a moth to the flame. Even if it begins as but an ember, even if it cannot be seen.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“A city of iron, a sea of soot. When the calamity has been repelled, the pilgrimage will be hailed.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“Guided by the Staff of Selection, watched over by the foreign traveller, the child of salvation will reach the throne.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“The true king takes their place on the throne. A bloodstained crown presented.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“Ring out, ring out; like thunderous fury, like fiery lamentation. Let the six bells toll in demonstration. Make way for the true king.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“Before the red calamity reaches us. Before the black calamity bites.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“Although our work may be neglectful, we are descended of free fairies.”
 
**Singing Fairies:**
“Ever absent is our hope. A shining tomorrow is desired.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's nothing in this song that says “Norwich will be destroyed.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oberon said that it was inevitable that such a thing would happen.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Could it be...that he knows additional verses of this song of prophecy?
 
**Oberon:**
I do. The song actually has 18 verses.
 
**Oberon:**
At the moment only 14 of them are widely known. Actually, four of them were censored and cut out.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I knew it! Why did you hide this, Oberon!?
 
**Oberon:**
I'm sorry, I just forgot to tell you! Can we end this conversation here, please!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You shouldn't use your authority to fool us.|
 
**Oberon:**
...Looks that way. But I didn't want to lie to you. It hurt me too.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...There was a reason you didn't share them, right?
 
**Oberon:**
...In retrospect, I might have been a little too overprotective.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Alright, I'll fess up. The four other verses I heard go like this:
 
**Oberon:**
Verse 8.5: “Though the harbor returns to the water's edge, the Calamity heads for distant skies.”
 
**Oberon:**
Verse 9.5: “The round fortress shall burn out, the bell of the waters shall be revealed.”
 
**Oberon:**
Verse 10.5: “Upon the sinner who admits their guilt, the blade of decapitation is felled.”
 
**Oberon:**
Verse 12.5: “Their duty fulfilled, the Child of Prophecy shall bid farewell to their place of origin.”
 
**Oberon:**
As you can see, there's a lot of ominous phrases in there.
 
**Oberon:**
The reason they were cut may be because they were “inaccurate for a prophecy”.
 
**Oberon:**
In fact, verse 8.5 here has already been proven wrong. “Though the harbor returns to the water's edge, the Calamity heads for distant skies.”
 
**Oberon:**
It goes without saying the “harbor” is Norwich. The “water's edge” is the coast, where there's no longer a city.
 
**Oberon:**
I had resigned to the fact that Norwich would be destroyed despite us beating the Calamity. But...
 
**Da Vinci:**
That didn't happen. Because another Child of Prophecy appeared...I guess?
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah. It proves that not even Ainsel's prophecies are absolute.
 
**Oberon:**
Especially those four verses. So I've stopped worrying about them.
 
**Oberon:**
More importantly, it's almost time to leave. Artoria and Gareth, Muramasa and Habetrot.
 
**Oberon:**
With friends like these, I feel safe leaving you guys.
 
**Oberon:**
I think I'll split off here for now, if that's alright.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
More information gathering?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
That's part of it, but I really want to hurt Spriggan.
 
**Oberon:**
For the time being, I think I'll work with the Count to bring that guy down to rock bottom.
 
**Oberon:**
The reason you were separated from Mash is because he took in the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Oberon:**
Don't you want some payback for that?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Certainly.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Make him flat out broke.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, leave it to me! It's not my way as the Fairy King to draw blood, but I'll make him shed rivers of gold!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know it's about time, but I have something to tell you guys.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Oberon's going off on his own, right? I had a feeling that might be the case.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I see. Well...he's not a combatant, so it's not necessary for all of us to act together.
 
**Gareth:**
I'm sure Oberon will be fine splitting off from us, but why isn't Rab-bit here?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, he's currently working overtime. See, he's apparently a subject of Aurora's, so...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Wouldn't Aurora get in trouble if it were known he was coming with us?
 
**Da Vinci:**
So he'll stick with Oberon. If anything happens, he'll come running with his carriage.
 
**Gareth:**
I see, if you say so. But...then there's this pink fairy.
 
**Gareth:**
Are you coming with us, Habetrot? I think it'll be dangerous going to Camelot...
 
**Habetrot:**
I'll be fine, don't worry about me! Just think of me as your spectator.
 
**Habetrot:**
Not to mention, shouldn't you be worrying less about me and more about yourself, Gareth?
 
**Habetrot:**
I mean, I'm probably more useful and stronger than you~. In battle, I'm an irreplaceable healer!
 
**Habetrot:**
Fujimaru, I won't let you die until you meet Mash again.
 
**Habetrot:**
So go ahead and run headlong into battle as much as you want!
 
**Habetrot:**
No matter the wound, I'll sew it up with my magic needle! So long as it doesn't kill you instantly, it's all right!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's a big help, but...|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see you practice Nightingale's form of medicine.
 
**Habetrot:**
Nightingale? Sounds like some kind of fairy. So there's a nurse as sweet as me~
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...Quiet, everyone. Her Majesty's troops are coming through the main gate.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I apologize for arriving 10 minutes past the scheduled arrival time.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Fairy Knight Gawain, and 30 fairies of the First Imperial Cavalry of the Mors Extermination Division.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
We are here to receive you as honored guests of Camelot, and will guarantee your safety on your journey.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Artoria, at least greet her.)|
 
**Artoria:**
Of course! Thank you for your escort!
 
**Artoria:**
You may not know how to travel comfortably with such a giant body, but keep an eye out for us, you got it!?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...Well, that was my intention.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We look forward to working with you.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...Likewise. I'll be relying on your assistance as well.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You all are our charges. If you don't keep that in mind, then the soldier's duties will be more taxing.
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The Child of Prophecy and the foreign magus will ride in our carriage.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Your vassals will follow on foot. Are there any obje&mdash;you!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The blackguard who tried to take Her Majesty's head! How are you still alive!? You should be at the bottom of the Great Pit!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, Lancelot beat the stuffing out of me, and tossed me headfirst down that hole.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But sorry to say, it looks like I'm still here. Long story short, I'm the Child of Prophecy's bodyguard.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Tell Lancelot not to let a Servant out of her sight until she finishes off his Saint Graph!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...tch!
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
Lord Gawain...is it really all right to invite this fairy to Camelot...?
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
Even if he doesn't go for the Queen's head a second time...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...It doesn't matter. I was merely distracted by an unfamiliar technique at the time.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Next time, I'll deal with him myself. Her Majesty has ensured me that slight damage to the castle would be tolerated, should the situation call for it.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, isn't that something? You did seem a bit constrained back then.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Next time, let's both cross swords without holding back. Preferably in a straight fight, with no distractions, right?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...Hm. It seems the Child of Prophecy has a bit of a discerning eye.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
However...the other vassals...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...Can't be helped. Hey. Open one of the wagons.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The Servant goes in the same cart as the foreign magus.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Treat those two as honored guests until we reach the castle. We'll move faster that way.
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
Sir! Right away!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
We'll use the western highway to reach Camelot. On the way, we'll spend one night in Oxford.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
That way, we circumvent the Great Pit and head for Camelot. For those two days, we are a single party.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Under no circumstances are we to turn our swords against each other. Do you understand, foreign magus?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(nod)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course.
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Very well. Then let's move out! This may be an escort mission, but keep your guard up!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Now that the Calamity has been cleansed, the Mors' poison is spreading throughout all of Britain!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
As soon as they're encountered, draw your swords and annihilate them! And don't let our guests scream!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
...I'm relieved. This is no different from being in Red Rab-bit's carriage.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
...By the way, are you prepared yet, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean, for the audience with the Queen?|
 
**Artoria:**
W-well, yes, that. Wow...you said it so naturally.
 
**Artoria:**
You must be used to this sort of thing...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm nervous, but...
 
**Artoria:**
You say that, but you look like you're used to it!
 
**Artoria:**
I couldn't get a wink of sleep and practiced carrying my staff last night...
 
**Artoria:**
Nervousness about 20%, calmness about 80%... oh noooo, my servant is too much of a heavyweeeeight...
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
No, Fujimaru is just as nervous as you, Artoria.
 
**Da Vinci:**
{(M)He/(F)She} just knows that you need to stay calm in a pinch.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Because a Master is a commander who not only gives orders to Servants, but also has to be wary against them.
 
**Da Vinci:**
They excel at techniques like organising their feelings, as opposed to being a frontline combatant.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Is that so? You've met many kings before?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, all kinds.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Goddesses too.
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Still, I can never quite get used to it.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
By the way, about Fairy Knight Gawain out there...
 
**Da Vinci:**
According to what I heard in Norwich, she was the first Fairy Knight in the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It was 200 years ago now, 1,800 years into the Queen's rule. There was a huge outbreak of caterpillar-type Mors in the middle of the country.
 
**Da Vinci:**
A Calamity later known as the “Caterpillar War.”  Gawain was the one to quell it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It was different from the Calamity we purified in Norwich,
 
**Da Vinci:**
but she's probably a fairy recognized by the Queen for resolving a Calamity, just like Artoria.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that surprise?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is that respect?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
N-no, it's neither surprise nor respect. Ba—Gawain's nothing like that.
 
**Artoria:**
But...I see...so Queen Morgan isn't the only fairy who can cleanse Calamities...
 
**Artoria:**
I'm getting more and more nervous...like I always do...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Crap, that didn't help, did it? Sorry, sorry.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But the Caterpillar War wasn't that big of a Calamity.
 
**Da Vinci:**
At least, it wasn't one of the big ones that arise every thousand years...Norwich's was certainly bigger.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We saved a city. That's something you can be proud of, Artoria.
 
**Artoria:**
...Right! It was thanks to Mash and Fujimaru,
 
**Artoria:**
but I helped too! I won't lose to some Fairy Knight when it comes to defeating Mors!
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
Mors smoke confirmed nearby! Approaching from 3, 7, and 11 o'clock!
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
Lightning Corps, prepare Mystic Codes! Guards, form a perimeter!
 
**Artoria:**
Fujimaru!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it, we'll help!|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You want to show off for Gawain a bit, huh?
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah! We're gonna leave her speechless!
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The fact that you exited the carriage must mean you have no intention of relying upon our protection.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Very well, I'll accept your help. Their numbers are too great. We'll take on casualties if we're by ourselves.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Child of Prophecy, foreign magus, with me! Do not leave my side!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
More than ten large Mors...no, they're multiplying! The difference in strength is too great, we can't handle them!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Anyone not armed with iron, fall back. We don't need to defeat them, just set a decoy and gather them into a single group!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
When they gather together, I'll incinerate them all!
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
They don't seem to be taking the bait! They seem to have a different objective this time&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
They couldn't...!? (No...are they after the Child of Prophecy...?)
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;You.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No need to thank me. Just striking while the iron is hot.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
More importantly, what's the plan? If you're a general, you should know when to cut your losses.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
... (...how vexing, but it's as this man says.)
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
(Should we abandon the wagons and have the troops fall back, or just have the ones we're escorting run ahead of us...)
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
(...No. I am a Fairy Knight. I will not permit retreat in the face of Mors.)
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
(But the Mors are moving in such a way as to avoid gathering together...they're clearly wary of Galatine&mdash;)
 
**Gareth:**
The rearmost wagon has been destroyed! Wh-wh-what should we do, Habenyan!?
 
**Habetrot:**
Wow...we've got a Fairy Knight and we still have to fight...
 
**Habetrot:**
Man, she's terrible at this...
 
**Habetrot:**
You're supposed to be someone who has trouble holding back their incredible, uncontrollable firepower!
 
**Habetrot:**
Well, no use complaining.
 
**Habetrot:**
Fighting's a pain in the ass, but so's hoofing it from here!
 
**Habetrot:**
Gareth, let's take out the smaller Mors! Leave the big ones to the Fairy Knight!
 
**Gareth:**
Roger! Gareth, doing her best! I'm getting a little used to killing Mors&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
...Habenyan, Habenyan.
 
**Gareth:**
Is there some sort of blue light flying in our direction from Camelot?
 
**Habetrot:**
Ah! (That light, it's the same one as in Sheffield&mdash;)
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Abandon the purge and retreat! Take only the carriage and the first wagon, abandon the rest!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Hurry, assemble! Lightning Corps, see to our charges, Imperial Guard, gather the luggage!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I'll keep the Mors occupied&mdash;!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;What do you think you're doing, Lancelot!? I don't remember calling for help!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I agree. I don't think you needed help either. But these were Her Majesty's orders.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;Inferior life forms as enemies, confirmed. Commencing sweep-up operation.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Stand back, Gawain. Crushing them all is my job.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Amazing...she flew by in the blink of an eye...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's like a fighter jet...
 

---

 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
Enemy Mors annihilated! Amazingly done, Lord Lancelot!
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
The “dragon fairy” who knows no defeat! Britain's most beautiful Fairy Knight!
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
To think you could take out such large Mors with such ease and efficiency!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
As per the Queen's orders, the swarm of Mors has been purged. Gawain, I'll leave the convoy to you.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(And she just takes off...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(VTOL?)
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...Hmph. Leave it to me, she says, but she just thinks it's beneath her.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
What are you all celebrating for!? Repair the destroyed wagons right away!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
This is a pretty sorry showing for your first day on the job! Leave in Oxford is cancelled!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Each of you are to provide a report reflecting on your mistakes today!
 
**Gawain's Soldier:**
Y-yes sir! Please forgive us, Lord Gawain!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...Damn, how pathetic. Even you wretches should be able to bring down one or two of the large ones.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Is this what happens when you rely too much on the Fairy Knights?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Not just the humans, but it seems the fairy soldiers need to be broken in as well...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...uhm...
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Ah! ...I apologize, it had slipped my mind. Your assistance is appreciated. Your name was&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...I have to apologize again. I never got your name. I never had the authority to do so.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
To not know the name of the person offering assistance in a time of need, such a thing is the height of rudeness.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Tell me your name, foreign magus. I am Gawain.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's Fujimaru.|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;I see. A good introduction, full of hostility.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
We're going to be enemies eventually. It's reassuring to know you have guts.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
We'll resume the escort.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
And don't waste your breath with idle chatter in the carriage. Under some circumstances, your voices may carry on the wind.
 
**Gareth:**
I heard we'd be spending the night at an inn in Oxford, but to think we'd end up camping outside instead...
 
**Gareth:**
Well, in times like these, one must pursue a meal!
 
**Gareth:**
I'm very sorry, Mr. Imperial Guardsmen, but I'm eating the cake the Count gave me!
 
**Gareth:**
Oh, is mine cheesecake? That's what it says! What about yours, Artoria?
 
**Artoria:**
Mmm. Mine says it's roll cake...wow, they look like logs, and seem really easy to eat!
 
**Artoria:**
Just like the Count, to be so thoughtful! Everyone from pan-human history is so considerate!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You could say that.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I wouldn't say that.
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Imoyoukan...? How attentive is that guy?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
This makes me want some tea...think I'll go back to the river and get some water...
 
**Habetrot:**
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Chiffon cake? Is that what this is?
 
**Habetrot:**
This tastes so joyful! There are so many kinds of sweets!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, seems like a wide variety of cakes have been created in the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's Woodwose's restaurant chain in the south, Edinburgh's gourmet desserts in the north,
 
**Da Vinci:**
or so I heard in Salisbury. But it's not just cheesecake that's popular.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Why is that?
 
**Gareth:**
Eh? Well cheesecake is very tasty, but it does make you kinda thirsty.
 
**Artoria:**
It's because the big shot up north hates cheesecake.
 
**Artoria:**
Cheese is improper for dessert, and chocolate is king... that's her way of doing things.
 
**Artoria:**
But for us southern fairies, something like chocolate is far too much of a luxury item for us to be familiar with...
 
**Artoria:**
It's an expensive item...lower-class fairies will never earn enough morpounds to be able to afford it...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm? Fujimaru, is there something on your mind?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm gonna go bring some food to Gawain.|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you in the habit of eating something sweet after meals?|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I don't really eat sweets. When it comes to prepared meals, I prefer meat dishes.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I won't take that, but...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Have a seat if you want to talk. I can appreciate that level of subtlety.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It's about Lancelot, isn't it? You want to know all about&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, I want to hear about you, Fairy Knight Gawain.|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...I see. You're after my true name, aren't you?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Your intelligence gathering is pointless, but I have to give you credit for attempting to do what you can.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
By the way, I haven't thanked you for today yet. Sit. I'll share a story with you to pass the time.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I came into this Britain 400 years ago now.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
An upper-class Fang Clan fairy who lived in Norwich... one of the “next generation”.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
But I didn't look anything like my predecessors.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
A member of the Fang Clan, but my body looked like one of the Wind Clan...no, I looked like a human.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Some called me a Changeling, others said it was because of the curse...from the battle with the Mors 600 years earlier.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Either way, I don't know what the reason was. I don't think I want to know either.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I was granted the honor of knighthood for ending the Caterpillar Wars.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
For 1,800 years of Her Majesty's reign, the title of “Fairy Knight” had been sealed.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The Fairy Knights were considered to be the vassals of the savior Tonelico during the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The first one was named...was named...hm? Sorry, I can't seem to recall it.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Anyway, they met their end in Orkney. Since then, Her Majesty forbade them.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
But in order to exterminate the endlessly-multiplying caterpillars, Her Majesty decided to break that seal.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I was gifted the name of a someone said to be a Knight of the Round Table from a foreign land...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
“Sir Gawain” was the name I received, and alongside it, I received the power to strengthen my own horn, my sword.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Galatine...a Noble Phantasm, you say?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I'm confident it can match the original carried by Sir Gawain.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
But I can't say the same about myself. I can't stand aside the genuine Knights of the Round Table of pan-human history.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...what she just said...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Could she...revere the Knights of the Round Table...?)
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...No, let's not speak of the Knights of the Round Table. I don't know why, but others say it's creepy when I do so.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Instead...yes, let's talk about the war with the Mors.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Year 1000 of the Queen's Calendar. A thousand years ago from now. The story of a Great Calamity.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
A time when a Mors was crowned a “king,” raised an army, and waged war on the Queen and the five clans.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It's said that “king” was a strange being. He didn't attack fairies. He didn't slaughter the humans.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
He lived only for the fire and lightning.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It did not matter what it was. He burned it, destroyed it, and revelled in the clouds of smoke that followed.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
He reduced cities and forests to scorched earth, burned the very ground itself, and summoned the storm clouds. The crash of thunder coming down from the storm above was music to his ears.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
There were fairies that called him the “King of Storms”. Her Majesty forbid the utterance of that name.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
This war against the Mors King lasted for decades, but finally the Fang Clan brought it to an end.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The “king” was defeated by Woodwose, who had just taken over as head of the Fang Clan from his predecessor.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The Great Calamity...the magical energy-devouring “Mors King” was repelled before the Fang Clan.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
But...it's said that on the verge of death, the “king” imposed a curse on the Fang Clan.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A curse...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What was it?
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...The fairy-devouring Black Dog.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
After the “king” disappeared, the Black Dogs started to roam the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
But they eat the Mors as well. To tell you the truth, they're far from being considered complete vermin.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Some of them are even trained and broken, then used in Mors extermination squads.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Just like me. You haven't heard? The Black Dog Lord, they call me.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
That is what I am. Even after becoming a Fairy Knight, I'm still vilified with such a name.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It's only right. After all, I'll eat anything. Including fairies&mdash;and humans.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh&mdash;|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Losing your nerve now, are we?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
When the woman you're asking information from is feared as a monster throughout the fairy kingdom?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Don't worry. I won't prey on you. I speak only of the strong.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
My rule...my alien common sense as a fairy... enhanced due to predation...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I can take on the abilities of the fairies I consume. There are some compatibility and capacity limits though.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Right now my stomach is full of Foul Weather, the great fairy of the Earth Clan.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...During the Caterpillar War, we desperately needed his Sacrament.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
But he wouldn't come out of Cornwall. He just sealed himself in his own fortress.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I killed him in single combat as a knight and took in his flesh, and that's how things are now.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;That's enough of this for now. The post-dinner break is over. Get out of here.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for talking to me.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I didn't think you'd be this talkative.
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I'm used to conversing with humans. After all, right now my man is one.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eeh!?|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Ah&mdash;n-no, when I say that, I don't mean a relationship between a man and a woman, nor do I intend to eat him.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
He's merely a guest I've allowed to recover at my residence for a short while.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
But&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You're just like him. The way you're not afraid of me, and how you're inquisitive without being malicious.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
We'll take turns standing watch tonight. You rise early tomorrow, so don't stay up too late.
 
**Singing Fairies:**
Be at ease, be at ease. The prayer is over, close your eyes.
 
**Singing Fairies:**
The time for fun is over. Put down your books and dim your lights.
 
**Singing Fairies:**
Today has come to an end, so say goodbye. Once and forever, today has ended.
 
**Singing Fairies:**
Forgive us, forgive us. Forgive us our sins, for we will forgive you your sins.
 
**Singing Fairies:**
It's all in the past anyway. Just be sure to clean up!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...again...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...that song...
 

---

 
**--ARROW--:**
 

 ~2 days since departing Norwich~ ~30 days since arriving in the Fairy Kingdom~
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So that's the Camelot of the Fairy Kingdom&mdash;|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
I-it really is impressive. I've seen it from the other side of the Great Pit, but...
 
**Da Vinci:**
So what you can see from Oxford is the back side of the castle.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I thought it looked like a wall, but looking at it from the front - it really does look like a royal palace.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There are housing districts around the main gate, and even more within the ramparts.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Is that what separates the general public from the upper class?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...So the gate's on that side, huh? The castle faces the Great Pit.
 
**Gareth:**
I-is that so? Then that main gate is actually the back entrance?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, no. Just a mistake. Sorry for the confusion, Gareth.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You have to go through that gate to enter the castle. There's no route in from the Great Pit.
 
**Habetrot:**
What about fairies that can fly? They could get in easily.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That's not gonna happen.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The front of the castle...the side facing the Great Pit is covered by a magical barrier.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You'll understand if you're ever unlucky enough to be tossed off the battlements. Camelot's walls are studded with gunports.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Usually you put those on the front, right? That's why the front of the castle is the “Great Pit side.”
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(It's not the front gate that Morgan is worried about...)
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Ah! (Fujimaru, Fujimaru)
 
**Artoria:**
(Gawain doesn't look too happy. She's staring to the north...)
 
**Artoria:**
(Why is she in such a bad mood? Ask her, Fujimaru. You're friends now, right?)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
S-sure. (She's coming on strong...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're not that close.
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
What is it, Fujimaru. Are you afraid to enter Camelot now...?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...I see that's not the case. What rouses my anger, you say?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You'll understand when you see it. It's Knocknarea's army to the north.
 
**Artoria:**
Knocknarea? Huh? Where? I can't see her anywhere.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
I see. You can't see with your stature. How unfortunate.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Well, it's fine if you don't. It's none of your concern.
 
**Artoria:**
It's totally our concern!
 
**Artoria:**
Fujimaru, put me on your shoulders! Pretend you're Red Rab-bit!
 
**Artoria:**
Muramasa, make a watchtower or something!
 
**Artoria:**
Fujimaru and me could climb it together!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hold on a second, isn't this exactly where my handy tools come into play?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Here, a telescope for long-distance viewing. With this, your eyesight's as good as Gawain's.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Take a look at the plains to the north. There's a huge one glaring back at us.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hm?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Wow, I can see so far! Thanks, Da Vinci!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Turn the dial on the side. Now it's focusing on five kilometers away.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Turn it four more notches and it'll focus on 20 kilometers. You see them?
 
**Da Vinci:**
The fairies covering the plains. That's the other queen we've heard so much about in the south...
 
**Da Vinci:**
The army of northern fairies led by Knocknarea, the “King's Clan.”
 
**Artoria:**
That's an army!? It's not just Fang and Earth Clan...
 
**Artoria:**
There's a lot of masked soldiers! What're those, giants!? There are giants too!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
That's right. Knocknarea's Rule is to distribute wealth and power equally among her subjects, no matter what they are.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
She's the opposite of Muryan in Gloucester.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
But it's only effective where she is. Therefore...
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see. If she's leading an army, she has to be at the center of it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, look a little further ahead.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You see that conspicuously big wagon that looks like a fortress?
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's a fairy standing on top of it, looking down at us.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I've never seen her before, but I can say without a doubt that is Knocknarea, the Queen of the North.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hm? Let's see...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know I've seen her somewhere before...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That Celtic bodysuit...
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The one we fought in North America, Queen Medb of Connacht&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(No matter how you look at her, that's Medb!)
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Medb...? Do you have a fairy just like her in your world?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...Still, what is she thinking? It's not me she's fixated on, it's you...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Did you do something to incur her wrath, Fujimaru?
 
**Da Vinci:**
See? Doesn't she look just like Medb? Except for a slight...well, okay, major change in fashion taste.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...But she's staring straight at Artoria, I wonder...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Is it condescending? Or is she mad? Whatever it is, it's indescribably hostile...
 
**Habetrot:**
I can't believe she would assemble her army so openly, even if it is 20 kilometers away.
 
**Habetrot:**
Isn't this a blatant act of hostility towards Queen Morgan?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
...She's still within her own territory, if only just barely.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
She insists it's “military exercises in preparation for the Calamity.”
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Up until ten days ago, she was assembling them forty kilometers away.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
When she saw that Sheffield had fallen, she seized the opportunity and immediately headed south.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
20—no, 30,000 troops? This goes beyond a show of force; this is military intervention.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What about her supply train...oh, right. Fairies don't need to eat, do they?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Yeah. Unlike humans. That's what makes Knocknarea's army so special.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
She despises humans. Even if she's fighting the Mors, she won't make use of them.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
She claims to be queen of an “absolute zone of control, for fairies and by fairies alone.”
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...a domain of nothing but fairies...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Sounds like Medb...yet it doesn't...)
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Either way, she won't advance any further.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
She doesn't have enough reason to challenge Her Majesty, and her odds of winning are slim.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The northern fairies have hysterically rebelled against Her Majesty at every opportunity.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
And every single time, they've been beaten and ran away, back to the north. This time will be no different.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;Come on, make haste. No more idle conversation.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Through the main gate. Steel yourselves further from here on out.
 
**Gareth:**
So this is Camelot's castle town...!
 
**Gareth:**
It's bigger than Salisbury, and more opulent than Gloucester...!
 
**Habetrot:**
The only ones living here are upper-class fairies. The mana in the air here is incomparable with the other cities.
 
**Habetrot:**
Magical energy gathered from fairies throughout Britain...is this the existence tax from the command spells?
 
**Habetrot:**
It's converging at the castle keep. I heard about this, but the amount is simply ridiculous.
 
**Habetrot:**
It doesn't matter if you ignore Knocknarea's army outside, you could never match this.
 
**Habetrot:**
It's insane to even think of defeating Morgan now.
 
**Habetrot:**
...I wonder if he had ever even been to Camelot before...
 
**Habetrot:**
You'd never even think of treason if you came here... and yet you did, didn't you, Boggart?
 
**Artoria:**
...Um, when we went through the gate, I saw something...
 
**Artoria:**
Weren't there some sort of characters written on there?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. That was Old English. “Only the innocent may pass.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
But it was covered in red paint. As if to reject the contents of the text.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
This is as far as the carriage will take you. Beyond here is the royal palace.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Only the Child of Prophecy and the foreign magus are allowed an audience with Her Majesty.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The rest of you will wait here. The clerks will attend you as guests of honor.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I see. Anything we should know?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
There's a hotel that serves the royal household before you. Relax and wait there.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
After the audience, I'll arrange for us to meet here. However...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Da Vinci, was it? A clever fai...Servant with both appearance and intelligence.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You may come as well. An advisor is necessary for the human magus.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, I was going to try and follow no matter what, but you sure made that easy.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We may be enemies, but my thanks for your consideration, Fairy Knight Gawain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Gareth, Muramasa, Habetrot. Looks like you're all on standby here.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We've learned quite a bit about the Queen's army over the past two days. She's even more strict about her rules than I imagined.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if it's just Fujimaru, Artoria, and me, there won't be any danger.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Whatever ends up happening, we'll be safe until we leave Camelot.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, I guess. I was the one who broke in there in the first place.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
There's no way I would be invited back in.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So keep your head on, Artoria. If she says something that makes you angry, don't be too quick to respond.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You too, alright Fujimaru? Keep an eye on your partner.
 
**Gareth:**
I'm worried, but...I can't imagine anything strange or bad happening...
 
**Gareth:**
Right, I'll wait here with everyone else! Take care of yourself, Artoria!
 
**Habetrot:**
No objections here either. I never really had any interest in Morgan to begin with.
 
**Habetrot:**
I'm just along for the ride until Fujimaru and Mash meet back up again.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Right.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go, Artoria.
 

---

 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(That staircase took almost an hour to climb&mdash;)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This is Camelot's keep...the throne room of the Queen...!)
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Prostrate yourselves. Offer yourselves up.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Worship. Submit.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
The envoys that come before the throne shall hold their breath. The thirty ambassadors and one hundred government officials shall close their mouths.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
The ruler who expands the borders. The ruler who built the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
You are in the presence of Her Majesty Queen Morgan. You hear the mantra of Her Majesty Queen Morgan.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Take heart, Child of Prophecy, foreign magus.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
This is Her Majesty's grace. This is Her Majesty's pardon.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Well done. You have all assembled without my summons.
 
**Morgan:**
Remarks from the ambassadors and government officials are forbidden.
 
**Morgan:**
The only ones in this room qualified to speak are myself, my guests, and...
 
**Beryl:**
And me, Beryl Gut, the Queen's husband. So sorry, all you hobnobbing big shots.
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Beryl Gut...! So he was in Camelot after all...!)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(And what's he talking about!? Queen Morgan's husband...!?)
 
**Beryl:**
Hey, it's my kouhai from Olympus! Hmm? Why the long face?
 
**Beryl:**
Hey now, didn't Mash tell you? I'm Morgan's catch.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The fact that you're here means...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't tell me you're Queen Morgan's...
 

---

 
**Beryl:**
You betcha. You're a Master, so you should be able to tell, Fujimaru.
 
**Beryl:**
Alright, I confess. I'm Morgan's Master after all.
 
**Beryl:**
The Queen's partner in ruling the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's no way that's true!|
 
**Beryl:**
Oh, but it is!
 
**Beryl:**
Well to be honest, I'm so out of my league I don't know how I should be feeling!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(...I can't make any careless statements in front of the Queen...)
 
**Morgan:**
...
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Artoria. Raise your head and step forward. I will allow it.
 
**Artoria:**
Y-yes!
 
**Morgan:**
...I see. The Child of Prophecy. You certainly seem to be the genuine article.
 
**Morgan:**
And you, foreign magus.
 
**Morgan:**
The Master of Chaldea, desperate to reclaim pan-human history.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Yes. That's correct.
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
I acknowledge your labors in Norwich. Well done expelling the Calamity, albeit inefficiently.
 
**Morgan:**
Receive my reward. By all rights, I should pay you in the legal tender of my Fairy Kingdom, but...
 
**Morgan:**
Your magical energy resources stem from the spatial magical occupancy value, the basis of which is the quantum of magical foundation... also known as QP, or Quantum Pieces, am I correct?
 
**Morgan:**
One hundred million should be sufficient. Take it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That much!? Wait, do you have a QP mint here or something!?
 
**Morgan:**
I have no need for such a thing. I merely looked at your form of magecraft and refined it further.
 
**Morgan:**
This ends my statement. If there is nothing else, your audience ends here.
 
**Morgan:**
Artoria. Fujimaru. Do you have any questions to pose to I, Queen Morgan?
 
**Morgan:**
Choose your words with care. Depending on your words, I may withdraw your status as my guests.
 
**Artoria:**
...!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(As expected, Artoria immediately froze up...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I have to be the one to speak up first here...!)
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
You first. Good. I'll praise your recklessness.
 
**Morgan:**
You who crossed five Lostbelts to stand before me now. Speak your desires.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Chaldea's objective is the restoration of the bleached Earth.|
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
Yes. Beryl Gut has informed me. I am aware of the state of the outside world.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But there's an anomaly in this Lostbelt.|
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
Interesting. What do you speak of?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Our observation predicts a “collapse” some time in the future. You could think of it as the same sort of thing as in Ainsel's prophecies.
 
**Da Vinci:**
This “collapse” will spread out from Britain and eventually cover the entire planet.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We don't know the how or why though.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We of Chaldea have disembarked into your Fairy Kingdom in order to understand and rectify this collapse phenomenon.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We have no hostile intentions towards a Lostbelt whose Fantasy Tree has already burned down.
 
**Da Vinci:**
From the very beginning, our objective has been to stop the “collapse of the world”.
 
**Morgan:**
I see. This is not an invasion, but a relief mission. Is that all you came for?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We seek the Divine Construct capable of rivalling the Alien God.|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes. The transcendent great magecraft that you unleashed upon Olympus, the holy lance Rhongomyniad.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We'd appreciate it if you could either share with us the theory or Mystic Code that makes such magecraft possible.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Olympus? Alien God? What are these outsiders talking about...?)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(No, they're being too brazen! How dare they make such requests of Her Majesty!)
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Hmph. Indeed, I know the weapon of which you speak.
 
**Morgan:**
I see that it is no lie that you came here to save Britain.
 
**Morgan:**
And thus, I can decisively say: your pan-human history will meet an unseemly demise.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
!?|
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
The outside world...the “collapse” you speak of that will propagate over the bleached Earth...
 
**Morgan:**
From the beginning, this was nothing more than expansion of my territory. I am the one denying you your history.
 
**Morgan:**
I am your enemy, so there is no sense in me giving you the Divine Construct.
 
**Morgan:**
Fujimaru. And you, the infant born of conceit.
 
**Morgan:**
If you want to save your world, then defeat me. You have no other way to save your pan-human history.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...I suppose that's a declaration of war then, Queen Morgan?
 
**Morgan:**
Indeed, it is. Pan-human history and I are incompatible. If you desire it, take it by force.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...Even despite negotiating...we have to fight...)|
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
The same goes for you, Artoria. The abominable Ainsel's “Child of Prophecy”.
 
**Morgan:**
At the end of the year&mdash;all the fae living in Britain will be destroyed by way of the Great Calamity.
 
**Morgan:**
But no matter how many times they die, fairies will always be born anew.
 
**Morgan:**
Even if all of Britain is engulfed in flames, as long as my castle still stands, the Fairy Kingdom will rise again and again.
 
**Artoria:**
Are you saying Her Majesty...defends her kingdom, rather than the inhabitants of Britain?
 
**Morgan:**
Indeed. I will not save the fairies. My kingdom alone is what will be protected.
 
**Morgan:**
There is no need to fear the Great Calamity with the amount of magical energy stored in this throne.
 
**Morgan:**
Furthermore&mdash;only a chosen fairy may rule from this throne.
 
**Morgan:**
You are one of them. You are different from the other fairies or the outsiders.
 
**Morgan:**
Neither a rebel nor an invader, but an arbitrator chosen by the Staff of Selection.
 
**Morgan:**
By accepting my invitation, you have shown that you are the true Child of Prophecy.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;A fairy sent down from Paradise. If it is you, you are justified in seeking my defeat.
 
**Morgan:**
There is no sin in fighting me, nor in the rivers of blood that will be shed as a result.
 
**Morgan:**
If you wish to save Britain, then defeat me and take my place on the throne.
 
**Morgan:**
Fulfill that foolish prophecy. You should know better than anyone that it is the only way.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Morgan:**
It seems our talk is over. I am pleased we have come to understand each other's positions.
 
**Beryl:**
I know, right! Getting all buddy-buddy through talk and not shedding any blood is a major turn-off for me!
 
**Beryl:**
Well then, seems like you've come to believe in convenient things like human decency and reasoning.
 
**Beryl:**
Negotiations have broken down. You don't really think you're gonna get home in one piece, do you?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ah! Aah, here we go!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, Artoria, get behind me! I thought this might happen...
 
**Morgan:**
Be silent.
 
**Beryl:**
!? !!! !? (Beryl shouting something)
 
**Morgan:**
Until they leave Camelot, these are my honored guests.
 
**Morgan:**
I will not permit a single strand of their hair, nor a sliver of their pride to come to harm.
 
**Beryl:**
!!!! !! !!!! ...! (Beryl screaming “Are you for real!?”)
 
**Morgan:**
Forgive my husband's rudeness, Fujimaru, infant.
 
**Morgan:**
Daughter of Tintagel. So long as you remain Artoria, I do not see you as my enemy.
 
**Morgan:**
Until you ring the pilgrim's bells, I will forbid the lords from attacking you.
 
**Morgan:**
However&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Should she choose to ring the pilgrim's bells, and rise up as the Child of Prophecy...
 
**Morgan:**
Yes. I will then see Chaldea too as my enemy, and marshal my forces.
 
**Morgan:**
Think carefully before you throw yourself into a battle you have no chance of winning.
 
**Morgan:**
Now, begone. There shall be no further words exchanged between us.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
...What is it?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Where did you take Mash?|
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Mash? And what might that be?
 
**Da Vinci:**
The magecraft you used to drive away the Calamity... one of our friends was swallowed by the convergence of the dark clouds.
 
**Da Vinci:**
A Demi-Servant who holds the Saint Graph of the Knight of the Shield, Galahad.
 
**Da Vinci:**
As someone who has bestowed the names of the Round Table on the Fairy Knights, you should know that name.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;I see. So that's what it was.
 
**Morgan:**
I have indeed captured the Knight of the Shield.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where!?|
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
I am not obligated to tell you. She is my spoil of war.
 
**Morgan:**
But I can assure you that she is safe. No one&mdash; not even I, can bring her to harm.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...?|
 

---

 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...We were escorted safely out of the castle, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...We got a lead on Mash, but...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...Right. We got nowhere.
 
**Artoria:**
We were arbitrarily declared “enemies”, and reminded that disobedience would not be tolerated...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. If I had to say anything about the results, it would be that they were subtle.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We know that Morgan is hostile to pan-human history,
 
**Da Vinci:**
and we know that Mash is trapped somewhere, though she's still safe.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But this only “confirms” what was previously “unconfirmed”.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We don't have a clear idea of how to win when we go against Morgan.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And the Divine Construct is out of the question.|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
I've made some progress on that, actually.
 
**Da Vinci:**
During our audience with Morgan, behind the throne... there was an atrium overlooking the Great Pit, right?
 
**Da Vinci:**
From there I was able to observe a magical energy pattern similar to the Lion King's in the Sixth Singularity.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Rhongomyniad has definitely been prepared as a “weapon.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
And not just one or two. More than ten of them are installed in the front of Camelot's castle.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's quite a few. Most probably they've been used here in Britain as well.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Rhongomyniad used on Olympus was...
 
**Da Vinci:**
“Just another use of it” as far as Morgan is concerned, or so I think.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If that's the case, she could at least sell us one but, well, negotiations are impossible at this point.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If we can't defeat Morgan, then our original goal of “obtaining a Divine Construct” is an impossibility.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...We've got a whole heap of problems...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Still, I'm glad we made it back safely. I see that Queen Morgan honors her word.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Seems like it. The amount of magical energy in Camelot, not to mention Morgan herself, is enough to send chills down my spine, but...
 
**Da Vinci:**
As a queen, she thoroughly enforces her laws. She even disregarded Beryl's objections.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
(Yeah, I know what you mean, Fujimaru. That's why things are even more confusing.)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Beryl himself said he was Morgan's Master. Then, is Morgan a Servant?)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(That can't be the case. She's been ruling over this Lostbelt for two thousand years now.)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Beryl only came here in 2017, same as the other Crypters.)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Morgan was already the queen of the Fairy Kingdom at that time. There's no way she was summoned as a Servant.)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(...Is Beryl lying, or is he being led to believe that himself?)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Whatever the case, our lack of information is staggering...)
 
**Gareth:**
Ah! Everyone's back! Yoo-hoo! Over here, over here!
 
**Gareth:**
Welcome back Artoria, Fujimaru!
 
**Gareth:**
Oh, how was the audience!? How was Her Majesty!?
 
**Gareth:**
Was she scary!? Was she strong!? Was she ten meters tall!?
 
**Gareth:**
She's got Tristan for a daughter, so I bet she chews through fairies!
 
**Artoria:**
U-uh, ahaha...she felt like a queen...
 
**Habetrot:**
Hey, don't bug the Child of Prophecy with questions, Gareth.
 
**Habetrot:**
She's mumbling since she doesn't want to ruin your dreams. She really wants to say that it was “totally normal”.
 
**Artoria:**
Ah&mdash;
 
**Habetrot:**
I know, I'm a master of a maiden's heart! Show a little more of yourself, Artoria!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah. I don't know about maiden's hearts or whatever, but she's right about putting yourself out there.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You're someone that hates to lose at heart, right?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
“I could never compete with the Queen. It'll take me a thousand years to catch up to her.”
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You're probably thinking something like that, right?
 
**Artoria:**
I am not! I was thinking more like a hundred!
 
**Gareth:**
...As expected, we don't get an escort on the way out... it's like they're telling us “now get out, but on foot!”
 
**Da Vinci:**
I imagined getting out of here would be hard, but it's tough confronting the reality of it...
 
**Da Vinci:**
They could at least give us a carriage, it would make getting to Norwich much easier&mdash;hm?
 
**Oberon:**
Hey, what a coincidence, ladies and gents!
 
**Oberon:**
I was out test-driving the new carriage, and somehow or other ended up here in Camelot!
 
**Oberon:**
But fate works in mysterious ways! Don't hesitate to hop on!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You were keeping an eye on us, weren't you?
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
You got it. I figured it was about time!
 
**Oberon:**
How'd your audience go? I want to hear all about it, but...
 
**Oberon:**
Let's get out of here first. If we hang out here forever we might provoke the Queen's soldiers.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Everyone, I am glad you were not led astray by the beauty of other carriages.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
My carriage has been improved in Norwich, and has been powered up with six seats and two bunks.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
I promise to make your journey throughout Britain a pleasant one.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
For I am the foremost fairy horse with a reputation for putting on the pressure in the homestretch, Red Rab-bit.
 
**Artoria:**
...Ignoring the cart, did you get a powerup as well?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
I revealed myself to be a vassal of the Child of Prophecy in Norwich, and allowed myself to go on a lavish spending spree.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
When the Earth Clansmen heard that, they prepared this armor, saying “well if that's the case”.
 
**Artoria:**
I see. Well, I hope you ponied it up yourself!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...and that was our audience with Morgan.|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
...Awfully blunt of her. Morgan sure seems motivated.
 
**Oberon:**
I was hoping that with Chaldea and the Child of Prophecy together, there would be a chance at peace negotiations, but...
 
**Gareth:**
From the beginning she had no intention of handing the throne over to the Child of Prophecy...to the true ruler.
 
**Oberon:**
And that's not all. Morgan's not even of a mind to save Britain.
 
**Oberon:**
“Expand her territory and overwrite the outside world.”  That's what she said, right?
 
**Oberon:**
I guessed as much too, but I had no idea of how exactly.
 
**Oberon:**
But when I heard about your audience, it hit me. Morgan's planning to make use of the Great Calamity.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...What do you mean?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
That magecraft she used in Norwich, the Water Mirror. She used it to purge the Calamity.
 
**Oberon:**
Right, Habetrot?
 
**Habetrot:**
Yeah. Transference magecraft is her forte. That was just on a much grander scale.
 
**Oberon:**
Even if Mash and Fujimaru hadn't played an active role,
 
**Oberon:**
the Calamity would have disappeared. Rather, Morgan would have taken it.
 
**Oberon:**
Meaning&mdash;Morgan decided to take possession of the Calamity.
 
**Oberon:**
Then there's only one answer. Morgan is able to use Calamities as her own magical energy.
 
**Oberon:**
She'll use that magical energy to turn Fujimaru's world...all of pan-human history... into her own territory.
 
**Oberon:**
Using a curse to destroy the world of fairies, she will destroy the world of humans.
 
**Oberon:**
That's Morgan's objective. She wants a Great Calamity to occur.
 
**Artoria:**
...Not to purge it...but to use it as a weapon...?
 
**Artoria:**
...If she even can. Like in Norwich, could she actually have purged it...?
 
**Gareth:**
That can't be...the only ones who will be saved are the fairies living in Camelot...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...That's true, the nobles living in Camelot seem to look down on the other cities.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
They say that “only the fairies in Camelot have worth.”
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
They're spoiled by the privileged status the Queen gives them. The Child of Prophecy is probably unsightly in their eyes.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The Queen may have said we're not enemies until you ring the bell, but Beryl is her husband, right?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We never know when they might come after us. It's good Oberon showed up when he did.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Let's get away from Camelot first, then figure out our next course of action.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The only thing I know for sure is our objective. In order to save Britain, to save the world...
 
**Da Vinci:**
And in order to save Mash, we have to defeat Morgan.
 
**Habetrot:**
...
 
**Narration:**
A few hours after the audience, in the throne room cleared of people...
 
**Morgan:**
...Still no movement from the Great Pit...this is rather disconcerting.
 
**Morgan:**
...Even though the Great Calamity arises once every 1,000 years.
 
**Morgan:**
The fairies are all complete fools.
 
**Morgan:**
I will use them to the last. To deny all of pan-human history.
 
**Alien Priestess:**
...
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;You again? You can't solve anything just by watching, woman.
 
**Morgan:**
If you are the priestess of the Alien God, come and kill me yourself.
 
**Morgan:**
Naturally, your apostle was defeated.
 
**Morgan:**
A Servant based upon the Heroic Spirits of pan-human history is no match for my Fairy Knights.
 
**Morgan:**
If all you can do is watch, then remain backstage. You are an unpleasant sight.
 
**Morgan:**
If you have an opinion about me to voice, then do so&mdash;yes, just like that man.
 
**Chaldean:**
I'm sorry to interrupt your fun little talk. I'd have knocked, but you don't have a door here.
 
**Morgan:**
Of course. How can you welcome a visitor with just a knock? Was there not a waiting room?
 
**Chaldean:**
The wraith repellent downstairs? Well-crafted, but unnecessary. I don't have that kind of time to be wasting.
 
**Chaldean:**
I'm not an outstanding mage like you, nor do I have your omnipotent body.
 
**Chaldean:**
I'm a man who can only do things to the same extent a human can. I can't afford to go to places I have no business being in the first place.
 
**Morgan:**
...I don't understand.
 
**Morgan:**
By any measure, you're one of the Chaldeans. A man from pan-human history.
 
**Morgan:**
The Alien God would undo that entirely...
 
**Morgan:**
And I could destroy it even before it achieves its objective.
 
**Morgan:**
Is that not what you came here to stop?
 
**Chaldean:**
No. Destroy it, if you can.
 
**Morgan:**
What?
 
**Chaldean:**
Indeed, if you are left to your own devices then this planet will collapse. Humanity will disappear.
 
**Chaldean:**
But compared to the aims of the Alien God, that is a far more preferable fate.
 
**Chaldean:**
You'll overwrite a history that did not align with your feelings in order to expand both your kingdom and your rule.
 
**Chaldean:**
I neither admire your wish nor your tenacity, but I do acknowledge your accomplishments.
 
**Chaldean:**
Therefore, I will not interfere. I will not help Chaldea.
 
**Chaldean:**
If you win and this planet becomes a dead world, then so be it.
 
**Morgan:**
...You won't raise your hand against me, you say?
 
**Morgan:**
Then why are you here? You said yourself you did not have the time to spare.
 
**Chaldean:**
I came to see your work. It is praiseworthy.
 
**Chaldean:**
You saw through the role of the Fantasy Tree, and instead of fearing it, you decided to make use of it.
 
**Chaldean:**
You wasted no time analyzing Chaldea's summoning formula, and then used it on your own flesh and blood.
 
**Chaldean:**
A masterful accomplishment. It's true what they say about you, a genius whose magecraft approaches the divine.
 
**Chaldean:**
Don't you get it? I came here to praise you, Queen Morgan.
 
**Chaldean:**
Because there is nobody else who will.
 
**Morgan:**
Hmph. I cannot be pleased by such approbation of my magecraft ability. That's nothing more than sarcasm.
 
**Morgan:**
If you have nothing else to say, then begone from my sight.
 
**Morgan:**
From here on out, this is my world. Be they Alien God or vile beast, there is no place for them here.
 
**Chaldean:**
I know that. In any case, this is the last point of intervention.
 
**Chaldean:**
At this point, even if I interfere, the outcome will not change.
 
**Chaldean:**
Even should this Lostbelt be seized, it is 2,000 years too late.
 
**Chaldean:**
A perfect history. A well-executed script. Victory is in sight, despite your blunder with Tristan.
 
**Chaldean:**
As someone who once stood in your place, I wanted to applaud how you brought this about.
 
**Chaldean:**
From my point of view, neither the Child of Prophecy nor Chaldea's Master has any chance of victory over you.
 
**Chaldean:**
Although&mdash;
 
**Chaldean:**
A third party has yet to appear on the board. If there are other factors at play, the story may yet change.
 
## Section 11: Londonium 
 
**Artoria:**
Therefore,
 
**Artoria:**
taking into account that the Queen's forces may be pursuing us, “unaware” of her orders,
 
**Artoria:**
we left Camelot in a hurry, and were moving along the northern border, when all of a sudden...
 
**Artoria:**
...we set foot in a bright, brilliant field of chocolate!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's sprouting directly into chocolate!|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Sweeeeets&mdash;!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Holy crap, this is amazing&ndash;!
 
**Habetrot:**
What do you think you're doing, that field belongs to someone! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves for trespassing!
 
**Habetrot:**
If you're going to sample it, start from the tip!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Ooooh, this is like the super-luxurious slab of wood that Lady Aurora once gave me!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
It doesn't compare to carrots, but I must say, this is sublimely sweet...!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(&mdash;dumbfounded)|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
DIVE!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What the hell is the matter with you morons!?
 

---

 
**Everyone else:**
Yummy! Sweet!
 
**Everyone else:**
The taste is a bit unrefined, but that's okay since it's SOOOOOO GOOOOOOD!
 
**Oberon:**
Hehe, everyone looks like they're having fun.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
How can you be so peppy, Oberon? We're supposed to be looking out for&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What's with you, Gareth? Aren't you gonna jump in with them?
 
**Gareth:**
Awawawawa...!
 
**Gareth:**
Everyone, get a hold of yourselves! You'll be in big trouble if you eat that!
 
**Everyone else:**
Ah...ah? (turns around with mouths smeared with chocolate)
 
**Gareth:**
Aaah, I knew it...!
 
**Gareth:**
These are the rumored chocolate fields of Knocknarea! The ingredients there are mesmerizing, paralyzing, and worst of all, high-calorie!
 
**Gareth:**
Fairies who eat that chocolate become addicted,
 
**Gareth:**
and are forced to obey Knocknarea until they die! (※Gareth's supposition)
 
**Everyone else:**
???? (doesn't understand what Gareth is talking about)
 
**Chocolate Field Mors:**
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/NkGVSh6.png#gh-light-mode-only)&ndash;!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Well. (casually wiping his mouth with his finger) Mors from the field...!?
 
**Gareth:**
Probably Mors lying in wait to prey on fairies paralyzed by the chocolate...
 
**Gareth:**
Chocolate→Fairies→Mors...a complete food chain.
 
**Gareth:**
It's a shame, but we can't rely on all those affected by the toxic chocolate!
 
**Gareth:**
Muramasa! It's up to us!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
R-right, I see. Well, I'm counting on you, Gareth!
 
**Gareth:**
Uh, Muramasa, why are you stepping back? And why have you been hiding your right hand behind your back all this time?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, it's right there, isn't it?
 
**Gareth:**
OLD MAN!!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Gareth:**
Oh, huh? Everyone, are you feeling a bit numb?
 
**Artoria:**
Sorry Gareth, but I'm feeling fine...I just hope this isn't poisonous or anything like that...
 
**Oberon:**
Yes, yes. You see, they call it a chocolate addiction...
 
**Oberon:**
“It's so delicious, that I can't ever forget it.” “Then, if you want to eat more chocolate, head to the north.”
 
**Oberon:**
That's all there is to it. I don't think there's any physical downside!
 
**Gareth:**
It's true! It's so amazingly good!
 
**Gareth:**
It's sweet, crunchy, easy to eat, and best of all, doesn't make you thirsty! My head feels like it's spinning!
 
**Oberon:**
Hahahaha. But, chocolate isn't exactly common, and I'm pretty sure this is a field owned by Knocknarea.
 
**Oberon:**
If you're tasting the produce without permission, well...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Shit! There's a huge army marching towards us from over the hill! And...what the hell is that?
 
**Mystery Soldiers:**
Weeeeeeeeeeeei!!!! Hohooooooooooi!!!!
 
**Artoria:**
We've been surrounded...! This presence...no, the surrounding magical energy is as thick as honey!
 
**???:**
That's enough, you shameless tourists!
 
**???:**
You've got some nerve, to behave as if my farmland is an all-you-can-eat buffet!
 
**???:**
I wonder, is it that you desire to become my slaves for the next generation? And the generation after that? And the generation after that?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This voice&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Without a doubt!
 

---

 
**H：???:**
Yes, be afraid. Will you bow down, and prostrate yourselves?
 
**H：???:**
No matter how far you've travelled, you'll know who I am the moment you gaze upon the beauty standing before you.
 
**H：???:**
So, that's why&mdash;
 
**H：???:**
In the name of Queen Knocknarea, divine punishment will be bestowed upon these chocolate thieves!
 
**Knocknarea:**
You are hereby charged with embezzlement of state property, smuggling of cultural goods, dining and dashing, and slandering the Queen's good name!
 
**Knocknarea:**
After one hundred years of packing chocolate into boxes,
 
**Knocknarea:**
you'll receive a pension commensurate with your work, and will be ordered to live out the rest of your sorry lives in Edinburgh!
 
**Artoria:**
I knew it...!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's Queen Medb...!|

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah! Medb is awesome!
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
...Who?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
It was five years ago, in Gloucester.
 
**Artoria:**
The first fairy I met after leaving the village was a tempestuous one.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Hmph...well, of course, it's only natural.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As a ruler, I can't help but kick around my rivals when they're all lined up like this...
 
**Knocknarea:**
In the once-in-a-century Princess Contest, the crowning glory went to me...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Let it be known throughout Britain that I, Knocknarea, am the new Queen of the Northern Fairies!
 
**Artoria:**
...didn't even qualify...didn't even make it up on stage...
 
**Artoria:**
It's fine. I only came because everyone in the village told me to...
 
**Artoria:**
A Princess Contest is a dumb thing anyway...
 
**Artoria:**
I just wanted to get out of the village for once...
 
**Knocknarea:**
...sigh. How stupid of me.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It's the middle of the harvest season. What am I doing here?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Is it some political appeal? Or a claim that I have some prestige as the reincarnation of Mab?
 
**Knocknarea:**
The elders will always treat me like a little girl...
 
**Knocknarea:**
The judges' idea of “beauty” is laughable in the first place.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Beauty is living a life you can be proud of yourself, not for someone else.
 
**Knocknarea:**
They don't understand that it's us participants who decide, not those bystanding judges&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh, hello. Are you that Tintagel girl from the preliminaries?
 
**Artoria:**
Urk.
 
**Artoria:**
No, you've got the wrong fairy...I'm more like a part-time waiter...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Why didn't you come to the finals!? I thought you'd be the last one in the end!
 
**Knocknarea:**
That would have been a great contest, I was all hyped up to beat the snot out of you,
 
**Knocknarea:**
and you were nowhere to be seen! Did you leave because you felt stupid!?
 
**Artoria:**
Well...it was kinda dumb...(especially me).
 
**Knocknarea:**
That “I don't get it” look!
 
**Knocknarea:**
As if you're saying “Hmph... I lost the match, but saved my dignity. A consolation prize is fine with me!”
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oooh, that really ticks me off! That's it, you and me are gonna compete right here!
 
**Knocknarea:**
What are you good at? Horseback riding? Dance? Music? Fighting? Packing sweets?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Whatever is fine. This will be the real finals! Don't let me down!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh. Those shabby clothes just won't do.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Mack! Dim! Tear them all off and throw them away!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Put on one of my dresses instead. Then get yourself up on stage one more time!
 
**Knocknarea:**
What is true beauty? What is true brilliance, worthy of a princess?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Let us two remind the foolish masses of that!
 
**Artoria:**
Uh&mdash;wai—no—sto—
 
**Artoria:**
Shut up for a minute, you sweet-talking pompous upstart&ndash;! I'll kick your ass&mdash;!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm sorry...I didn't think that you really didn't qualify...
 
**Knocknarea:**
My instincts have never been wrong, you know? The instant I saw you, a chill raced down my spine.
 
**Knocknarea:**
“She's bad news. She's different from the others. She'll turn the world upside-down,” stuff like that.
 
**Artoria:**
Umm&mdash;r-really? I looked like that to you?
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, I get it. I'm a late bloomer! That's right, because I'm the Chi&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
But it seems I was mistaken. You just have so many negatives, you came full circle.
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, is that so!? Then from now on, don't brag about your “good instincts!”
 
**Knocknarea:**
Yeah. I'll observe properly and not just rely on my intuition.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Anyway, what kind of village are you from, Artoria?
 
**Knocknarea:**
The southwestern edge of Britain? My city is on the very northern tip, so I couldn't imagine that at all.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Does the ash fall? What color are the forests? Can you catch fish? Are the people nice?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Also, what's up with that exploding lamp you just threw at me?
 
**Narration:**
The northern fairy who got close to me simply because she was curious. A happy memory from back when neither of us knew who the other one was.
 
**Narration:**
Her name was Knocknarea.
 
**Narration:**
My first friend, destined to one day clash with the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Artoria:**
...and so we spent time getting to know each other in Gloucester for...two days? Three days?
 
**Artoria:**
As you can see, she's a hopeless one who never listens to people, so she gives off a bad impression...
 
**Knocknarea:**
So do you, Artoria!
 
**Knocknarea:**
You seem so docile, but you're awfully sharp-tongued! I'm relieved to see you're the same as ever!
 
**Oberon:**
Well this is unexpected. You had a true friend who argues with you like that?
 
**Oberon:**
I mean...how is it you're able to quarrel with THE Knocknarea like this?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Impossible...I've been so nervous my tongue has been sticking out of my mouth for some time now.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
The Queen of the North. Head of the King's Clan, Knocknarea. Her magical energy conceals this campground.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Truly a great fairy of the highest degree...although her combat potential is not as great as a Fairy Knight's,
 
**Red Rabbit:**
there is nobody in the Fairy Kingdom who can match her in terms of alien common sense or size of territory...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it that great...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I'm not a fairy so I don't really get it...)
 

---

 
**Gareth:**
But how very like you, Artoria!
 
**Gareth:**
Whenever Knocknarea says something snide, you fire back twice as hard!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah. They're perfectly matched.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Artoria seems docile at a first glance but is troublesome at heart, while Knocknarea is flashy on the outside but a hard worker on the inside.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's like uneven craftsmanship. Arguing while being close-knit.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Shut up over there! I don't remember asking for your opinion!
 
**Knocknarea:**
You all are aware you've been apprehended as chocolate thieves, right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We are.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll pay you (because I'm rich now).
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
...
 
**Knocknarea:**
...Artoria. Come here for a sec.
 
**Artoria:**
What is it? It's not like you to be discreet. You want me to keep all the bad stuff that happened in Gloucester a secret?
 
**Knocknarea:**
...That's not it, we didn't do anything wrong. It's about... that one that talked back at me just now.
 
**Knocknarea:**
...Is that a human? Your servant? Did your dream come true?
 
**Artoria:**
N-no, {(M)he/(F)she}'s my ally, a magus from the outside world.
 
**Artoria:**
{(M)He/(F)She}'s pretending to be my servant, but if anything, {(M)he/(F)she}'s done nothing but help me so far.
 
**Knocknarea:**
...I see. So they're nothing more than your guard.
 
**Knocknarea:**
What's {(M)his/(F)her} name? I don't get why you haven't collared {(M)him/(F)her}. Tell me. Please.
 
**Artoria:**
So polite...are you really Knocknarea? Did you eat something bad? Or too much chocolate?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Uh... (No, I've got to be patient...)
 
**Knocknarea:**
Yeah, I've gotten sweeter lately. So what's {(M)his/(F)her} name? When did you meet?
 
**Artoria:**
{(M)His/(F)Her} name is Fujimaru. We met around twenty days ago now...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Meaning it's nothing serious yet. Well, I guess it doesn't matter who you associate with.
 
**Artoria:**
Huh?
 
**Knocknarea:**
...Aren't you a human? You're a human, and you're talking to me like that?
 
**Artoria:**
You're wrong, Knocknarea. She's Fujimaru.
 
**Artoria:**
A magus from the outside world and my ally.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh...the prophecy did mention that, I guess. The traveler from a foreign land. Whatever.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Still...you've got a good air about you. I mean your spirit, not your body.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If you look closely, you're covered in nicks and dings, but nothing's been damaged. It's almost encouraging.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Fujimaru. If you need a place to stay, come to my castle.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It would be a shame to see you enslaved by the southern fairies. Maybe you can cure me of my misanthropy.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Sorry, I got off track. Anyway&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
The Child of Prophecy of all people, how pathetic. Can you really manage with such a ridiculous entourage?
 
**Knocknarea:**
I can't believe you don't have an army.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Looks like my intuition really doesn't work on you.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The Child of Prophecy who saved Norwich. When I heard that fairy's name was Artoria,
 
**Knocknarea:**
I was all, “I knew it!”, but turns out I was wrong again. You're still just as pathetic as you were back then.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Can such a timid, low-class fairy really obtain nothing but third-rate friends?
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Correction, Knocknarea.
 
**Artoria:**
Don't make fun of my friends. They're much better than I deserve.
 
**Artoria:**
They're always smart, always brave, always adorable, and that one's always an old man.
 
**Artoria:**
If nothing else, they're much stronger than all the soldiers you always have waiting on you.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Is that so? Then let's test that, Artoria.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Your friends, my soldiers. Let's see who's stronger.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If you win, then I'll pardon your crime of stealing chocolate. After that, you're free to go.
 
**Knocknarea:**
But&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Hmm? But what?
 
**Knocknarea:**
But, if my soldiers win, Fujimaru is mine.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Eh. Wait, Fujimaru is your type, Knocknarea!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Wh—no way! I just want a magus to prepare for my war with Morgan!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Now let's get this started, Artoria! Who's the real savior of Britain, you or me&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
Let's begin the preliminaries!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We managed to win somehow! (Thankfully...)|
 
**Knocknarea:**
...hmph. Whatever. My predecessor did say you can have up to three chances.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Probably because love isn't easy to come by, I guess?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
By the way, that fairy commander just now...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I thought they looked familiar, but it was just an illusion. Let's forget about it and move on.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yeah! You're all amazing! Victory goes to Team Fujimaru!
 
**Artoria:**
Now let us all go! A queen should keep her promises!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Of course. I don't have time to play with you anyway.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm right in the middle of military exercises. My enemy is Queen Morgan, not the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I've got no use for a lower-class fairy who's still a nobody. Go wherever you like.
 
**Oberon:**
Oh? I guess the King's Clan doesn't see the Child of Prophecy as a problem.
 
**Oberon:**
You would really think you'd be better off capturing us than letting us go.
 
**Knocknarea:**
...
 
**Knocknarea:**
I do see you as a problem.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm the only ruler of Britain. For me, Morgan and the Child of Prophecy are both eyesores.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Be that as it may, Morgan's military strength is not to be underestimated. To ensure victory, I'll make use of whatever I can.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Either my provocations will get Morgan to leave her castle, or I'll lay siege to it myself after completing all my preparations.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Whichever happens, the other clans need to be held in check. Which is why I want the Child of Prophecy to play an active role.
 
**Knocknarea:**
You get it? All you have to do is hang around and Morgan's military power will start to wane.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm not saying you have to ring all of the pilgrim's bells. Could you ring at least a couple or so?
 
**Knocknarea:**
If you do that, I can take care of the rest.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'll take Camelot, overthrow Morgan, and banish all the humans from the island!
 
**Knocknarea:**
As the daughter of the great Mab, descendent of the northern fairies, I shall restore Britain to its former glory!
 
**Knocknarea:**
...Well, I can allow a few exceptions, since I am so generous.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If the humans would mend their ways, I could consent to establishing an autonomous zone in Britain.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As proof of that, I shall allow you to speak, Fujimaru.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Is there anything you want to ask me? As a special favor, I'll answer anything you ask.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well then, I'll take you up on that...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are there hearts scattered everywhere?|
 
**Knocknarea:**
(Hearts? Is that a figure of speech?)
 
**Knocknarea:**
So...you care about me that much, do you? Well it's only natural, since it's me.
 
**Knocknarea:**
You probably wouldn't believe it, human, but this is uncontrollable magical energy spilling out from within.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As a member of the King's Clan, I'm not supposed to show my dreams and desires until I have the throne, but...
 
**Knocknarea:**
My feelings...no, my passions, I guess? That's what's leaking out of me.
 
**Artoria:**
That's not something you should say with a smug face, you know.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why don't you work with the Round Table Army against Morgan?
 
**Knocknarea:**
No. A very big no.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I may tolerate humans, but I will not join hands with them.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The human Round Table Army is even more of a disgusting eyesore than Morgan's army is. If they ever appear before me, I'll crush them without a second thought.
 

---

 
**Northern Fairy:**
Pardon me, Lady Knocknarea. We've received an appeal from Edinburgh.
 
**Knocknarea:**
What is it? This is a good Mab Chance. We can continue the exercise later...
 
**Northern Fairy:**
No, it's about the response to the Mors disease. Lend me your ear, please.
 
**Northern Fairy:**
...specimens for transcription...insufficient... several refugees from Sheffield...
 
**Knocknarea:**
...I'll make the selections. Tell them they'll receive my list soon.
 
**Knocknarea:**
We're done talking here. You all are free to go. I don't care where.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Ah, but I have to say one more thing.
 
**Knocknarea:**
At least show some dignity, Artoria. Nobody's going to follow a shabby king, you know?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, we've gone south through the chocolate fields, and are now back in southern Britain.
 
**Gareth:**
We're almost to Gloucester. Can we stop there for a bit?
 
**Gareth:**
You've never been to Gloucester, have you, Habenyan?
 
**Habetrot:**
I haven't, but that's Muryan's city, right? I can only imagine what it's like.
 
**Habetrot:**
Sounds interesting, but there probably aren't any brides. I'm fine managing Fujimaru.
 
**Gareth:**
I see...that's too bad...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's head to a safe area for now.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about returning to Norwich?
 
**Artoria:**
No, on the contrary, I think Norwich would be too dangerous at the moment.
 
**Artoria:**
The Count may be there, but there's no way Spriggan hasn't taken any new precautions.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. I'm in favor of thinking things over in a safe location.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Do we fight the Queen, or do we just escape? It's a crucial decision. We need to sit down and think about it.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Gloucester is out then. Muryan aside, I don't trust Koyanskaya at all.
 
**Gareth:**
What about the Welsh forest? It is Oberon's territory, after all.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Or perhaps Salisbury? We could inform Lady Aurora of our doings.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We have too many candidates...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you think, Oberon?
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Hmm...
 
**Oberon:**
Well first of all, I can't recommend my forest. It's not suited for a base of operations.
 
**Oberon:**
And Salisbury and Norwich aren't safe.
 
**Oberon:**
We can't put too much faith in Morgan's promise that she won't interfere.
 
**Oberon:**
If Beryl Gut comes after us with the Queen's army, Aurora won't be able to protect us.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Like Knocknarea said, from here on out, we're going to need military strength.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Should we return to the Storm Border? I'd like to show it off to Artoria and Gareth.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If we circumvent the Nameless Forest, we can reach the coast.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I wonder if we could stop by Artoria's home of Tintagel on the way?
 
**Oberon:**
No, let's keep that as a last resort. We're not evacuating.
 
**Oberon:**
If we want military strength, there's only one thing to do.
 
**Oberon:**
As a matter of fact, the safest place for the Child of Prophecy is not a fairy city at all.
 
**Oberon:**
The capital of England in pan-human history, southeast of Oxford.
 
**Oberon:**
The base of the humans&mdash;the abandoned city of Londinium.
 
**Oberon:**
With Norwich's Calamity cleansed, Artoria has no need to worry about any of them.
 
**Oberon:**
As the Child of Prophecy who will save Britain, why don't you pay a visit to the Round Table Army?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Oberon:**
I appreciate you pushing this far after staying up all night and getting no rest. Londinium is just over those two hills.
 
**Oberon:**
But let's take a short break first. after all, it's almost lunchtime.
 
**Oberon:**
You'd rather enjoy a leisurely lunch outside than in a bumpy carriage, right, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks. Honestly, you're a lifesaver...|
 
**Oberon:**
No, I just wanted to get out and stretch.
 
**Oberon:**
This six-passenger carriage is convenient, but it's also a little cramped in there.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is it safe here?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
We passed through every major city on the highway overnight. The Queen's soldiers shouldn't be deployed in this area.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
We've finally made it to Londinium...what do you know about this place?
 
**Oberon:**
Over 2,000 years ago...
 
**Oberon:**
It's said to have been the largest city in Britain before Morgan rose to power.
 
**Oberon:**
The five clans lived together as equals, humans were elected as the city lords, and so on.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Huh? Then, Londinium was a human city!
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah. But it was destroyed by civil war towards the end of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Oberon:**
It was the grandest fortress city in Britain, but it was susceptible to malice from within.
 
**Oberon:**
I never could figure out why it was abandoned after that.
 
**Oberon:**
The Queen never did restore it, and she built herself a new castle at Camelot.
 
**Habetrot:**
Well well. I guess Oberon isn't as well-informed as he appears.
 
**Habetrot:**
Listen up. Londinium was destroyed by the clans.
 
**Habetrot:**
After Tonelico brought the war between the clans to an end, they named a human knight as the new king.
 
**Habetrot:**
A single human boy who led the Round Table Army.
 
**Habetrot:**
A new king for a new age, and all of Britain celebrated.
 
**Habetrot:**
But a riot broke out during the coronation ceremony by an anti-fairy group of humans,
 
**Habetrot:**
and some fairies living in Londinium were killed.
 
**Habetrot:**
The clan heads were angered by this and invaded Londinium, massacring the Round Table Army.
 
**Habetrot:**
The knight who was to become king died, and Tonelico was executed after taking blame for the riot.
 
**Habetrot:**
Grimm the Wise managed to escape,
 
**Habetrot:**
and the Black Knight wouldn't die no matter what they did, so they dumped him in the ocean with both ears crushed.
 
**Habetrot:**
Ashamed of what happened, the remaining Fairy Knight crossed over to Orkney with Tonelico's coffin.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Tonelico, the fairy that was hailed as a savior?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The Wise. Black Knight. Fairy Knight.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The four of them are said to have saved Britain many times...but what was the Fairy Knight's name?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I heard it from Mike in Salisbury. It was...it was...huh?
 
**Da Vinci:**
What was it? Weird...I'm sure I heard it somewhere...
 
**Habetrot:**
Don't think too hard about it.
 
**Habetrot:**
The point is it's an old human stronghold, cloaked in a bad history.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Camping in a castle destroyed by the fairies long ago?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Isn't that bad luck? Not that I want to appear superstitious.
 
**Habetrot:**
Heheh. You'll understand once we get there, Muramasa.
 
**Habetrot:**
If you ask me, both Morgan and the clan heads are dumb.
 
**Habetrot:**
It's ridiculous to ignore Londinium just because it has already fallen once.
 
**Gareth:**
You're familiar with Londinium, Habenyan? And yet you don't know about Salisbury or Gloucester.
 
**Habetrot:**
I know about Salisbury. The place with the cathedral?
 
**Habetrot:**
I've even seen Aurora. It's just not something I care about.
 
**Gareth:**
Is that so...is it really okay that we didn't stop in a beautiful city even once?
 
**Habetrot:**
It's fine. It's not like it's my job to enjoy the trip.
 
**Habetrot:**
But why are you fussing over me so much, Gareth? Oh, do you want to order a bridal gown?
 
**Gareth:**
Ah! It's way too early for me to be a bride, I haven't even met someone yet...!
 
**Gareth:**
No, it's not that...it's just...
 
**Habetrot:**
Just?
 
**Gareth:**
It's nothing! Gareth, going to get some water!
 
**Habetrot:**
...?
 
**Gareth:**
...haah...haah...I almost said too much there...
 
**Gareth:**
But...are you really okay with this, Habenyan?
 
**Gareth:**
...despite the fact I can see the future for Artoria and Fujimaru...
 
**Gareth:**
...I can't see Habenyan's...at all...
 
**Gareth:**
&mdash;Mors?
 
**Gareth:**
Oh no, I've got to take it out before it touches me...! Hiyaaaa&mdash;!
 
**Gareth:**
Guh...! That's strange...my lance has gone through so many times before...
 
**Gareth:**
...I see. Artoria was helping me with her magecraft.
 
**Gareth:**
But now I'm all alone&mdash;
 
**Mors:**
&ndash;
 
**Gareth:**
...That's just like me. I'm weak, yet I get carried away and get the wrong idea...
 
**Gareth:**
I'm going to die here, unimportant, unable to do anything&mdash;
 
**???:**
So close! If you had taken six, or even just three more steps, you could have run it straight through!
 
**???:**
You're still too small. You can't pierce a Mors' hide with just the weight of your lance.
 
**???:**
Keep in mind the leg you pivot on should be facing forward, not to the side, and make use of the weight of the earth.
 
**???:**
But that's something to worry about later. For now, can you stand up?
 
**Gareth:**
Ah&mdash;Y-yes. Um, you are&mdash;
 
**???:**
Just a passing-by waterboy. I saw you going into the woods.
 
**???:**
I came here to warn you about the Mors lurking in this area&mdash;
 
**Mors:**
&ndash;！
 
**???:**
...but it looks like I was a little late.
 
**???:**
Luckily, there's just the two of them. I could really use your help, if that's alright.
 
**Gareth:**
Y-yes, of course! I'm Gareth!
 
**???:**
I'm Percival. You can handle the one on the right, gallant knight.
 
**Gareth:**
P-Percival&mdash;Eh? Eeeeeeehhhhhh!?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Gareth:**
We won...I can beat Mors all by myself...
 
**Percival:**
Yeah, good job. You're plenty strong, and you'll get even better with some training.
 
**Percival:**
By the way, Gareth, was it? I've never seen your face around here.
 
**Percival:**
This is going to be a battlefield soon. If you want some friendly advice, it would be better for you to head to Manchester or Norwich.
 
**Percival:**
Unless...you came to join the Round Table Army in Londinium?
 
**Percival:**
Hmm...well, we're always in need of one more trustworthy ally, but...
 
**Percival:**
Such a cute little girl coming to Londinium, I wonder...
 
**Percival:**
The roofs will never be fixed in time...and the ghosts come out at night...
 
**Gareth:**
U-um, I'm sorry to bother you!
 
**Gareth:**
If I'm not mistaken, you said your name was Percival, is that right!?
 
**Percival:**
Yeah, Percival. Good name for a human, right? I think so too.
 
**Gareth:**
Let me introduce myself again! My name is Gareth, a follower of the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Gareth:**
The Child of Prophecy&mdash;Artoria, has come to Londinium!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
(Gareth is late...it's probably nothing to worry about, but... it's bugging me...)
 
**Artoria:**
Excuse me, I'm going to get some water too. We can go over the hills afterwards.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then, I guess we can all go...hm?|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Gareth's back, but why is she jumping up and down and waving at us?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
There's a tall man next to her. He appears to be quite the stallion as well, but...
 
**Oberon:**
Ah! That sturdy chest armor!
 
**Gareth:**
Heeey! Heeeeey! Everyoooone! Listeeeeen!
 
**Gareth:**
Percival, Percival!
 
**Gareth:**
The strongest human, the leader of the Round Table Army, Percivaaaaaal&mdash;!
 
**Percival:**
...
 
**Percival:**
Sorry about this. Somehow, this has turned into a bit of an impolite first meeting.
 
**Percival:**
It's an honor to meet you, Child of Prophecy. And you, foreign magus.
 
**Percival:**
I am Percival. I serve to manage the Round Table forces as their representative.
 
**Percival:**
I may look like a knight, but I've never been taught proper etiquette.
 
**Percival:**
My ill manners as a country bumpkin may show through, but I look forward to working with you.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The pleasure is all mine.|
 
**Percival:**
Yes. Glad to see you're so full of energy.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
By the way, why is Red Rab-bit so jittery?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
What do you mean why!? Percival is said to be the one human in the Fairy Kingdom...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
the one and only human spiritually strong enough to ride into battle atop a fairy horse...!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
The way they synchronize their breathing, and how they trust each other with their lives is enough to make any horse emotional...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
It's amazing, the union between rider and horse. It's like a dream of mine come true.
 
**Percival:**
Kundry would be delighted to hear that as well. She's saved me more times than I can remember.
 
**Percival:**
...oh right, we were in the middle of a conversation, and I start rambling on about my partner...
 

---

 
**Percival:**
I understand your plight.
 
**Percival:**
You need a safe place to use as a base to prepare for your confrontation with the Queen's army.
 
**Percival:**
In that case, Londinium welcomes you with open arms.
 
**Percival:**
I'm afraid we couldn't repair it in time for the arrival of the Child of Prophecy, but...
 
**Percival:**
It's one of the most defensible locations in Britain. Everyone there will protect you.
 
**Human Soldiers:**
We've got the lumber from the supply corps! Hurry and start repairing the ramparts!
 
**Human Soldiers:**
Use 80% on the walls, and 20% on the interior! Priority goes to the kids' houses!
 
**Q：Fairy Soldiers:**
This afternoon, we're sending a merchant to Norwich in disguise! If you need anything, put it on the list!
 
**Q：Fairy Soldiers:**
We've got the Count's backing, so there's no need to hold back! But keep the luxuries to a minimum!
 
**Soldier in Training:**
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!
 
**Instructor:**
We can't match the Fang Clan's movements! Countering them is more important!
 
**Instructor:**
Wait for the spear, then attack! If you thrust too early, you're easy to dodge!
 
**Instructor:**
When you feel it coming, put your shield forward! Place your sword so it pierces the side at the same time!
 
**Instructor:**
Arrows are unlikely to hit their mark! They'll sense you as soon as you take aim on them!
 
**Instructor:**
Sweep in groups of ten from the ramparts! If you hit one, great! It's effective as disruption, so don't get discouraged!
 
**Blacksmith's Young Apprentice (Male):**
I can only sharpen it, but it's still useful! Hey you, your spearhead's missing!
 
**Blacksmith's Young Apprentice (Male):**
You'll lose to the Fangs that way, just get over here for a sec!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
This place is pretty lively despite being run-down. Everyone's running around occupied with something.
 
**Habetrot:**
At first glance I can see about 300 soldiers who can fight. Maybe a few more?
 
**Habetrot:**
That doubles if you bring in the refugees. Are the weaker ones doing needlework in the back?
 
**Habetrot:**
This is great! They're more like a revived civilization than an army!
 
**Habetrot:**
Maybe this is where I'll find that bride!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. The walls and streets are in shambles, but it's more lively than any city we've seen up till now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The land that would eventually become the capital city of London in pan-human history. It's so full of life!
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is something wrong?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
No&mdash;It's nothing like that.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;How can a place like this be so beautiful?
 
**Gareth:**
...Artoria?
 
**Soldier Running In:**
Commander, you can't just jump off the walls and go running into the woods like that!
 
**Soldier Running In:**
You're the core of the Round Table Army, the hope of everyone gathered here in Londinium!
 
**Soldier Running In:**
I'd appreciate it if you would stop acting on impulse all the time from now on!
 
**Soldier Running In:**
&mdash;Ahem. Please excuse me.
 
**Soldier Running In:**
Are these potential new recruits? If so, then you should first register yourselves in the plaza...
 
**Percival:**
No, it's nothing like that, Magre. They're not new recruits.
 
**Percival:**
They're important guests. Isn't that right, Oberon?
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, at least for now. Whether or not we join the Round Table Army is up to Artoria.
 
**Soldier Running In:**
Oberon? Whoa, it's Oberon! When did you get back to Londinium!?
 
**Soldier Running In:**
Hey everyone, it's Oberon! That no-good Oberon is here&ndash;!
 
**G：Londinium Citizen:**
Oh wow, it really is him! Oberon the Heartless&ndash;!  
 
**Q：Londinium Citizen:**
He popped up out of nowhere again! Where the hell have you been all this time?
 
**I：Londinium Citizen:**
You're gonna stay for a while this time, aren't you!? Don't make the kids cry all over again!
 
**I：Londinium Citizen:**
The instant you disappear, we all get too depressed to do anything!
 
**H：Londinium Citizen:**
Especially the women! They get all hooked on your sweet talk, and they think they're all princesses or something!
 
**H：Londinium Citizen:**
It's fine for you to be nice to them, but don't make such a mess! They still have work to do!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even here...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oberon...
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Whoa, don't get the wrong idea, okay? I swear, I'm being serious here.
 
**Soldier Running In:**
Yeah, you were serious. Seriously putting on a show!
 
**Soldier Running In:**
When you show up, the Round Table Army becomes nothing more than a rowdy bunch of folk. This whole city becomes nothing but a festival when you're here.
 
**Soldier Running In:**
It's days like those that keep us all laughing...hey, wait.
 
**Soldier Running In:**
You said the next time you came, you'd bring the Child of Prophecy with you, so...
 
**Soldier Running In:**
Don't tell me...
 
**Artoria:**
(Aw crap...)
 
**Oberon:**
Yep. She's the rumored Artoria. The savior who protected Norwich.
 
**Oberon:**
She bears the Staff of Selection sent from Paradise, just like Percival's Spear of Selection.
 
**Oberon:**
In a nutshell, she's the one who you've been waiting for, the Child of Prophecy who will save Britain.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
The festival's in full swing now. Will we not be able to talk to Artoria for a while?
 
**Da Vinci:**
They're caught up in “Child of Prophecy fever”, but is it really okay to not intervene, Oberon?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I don't think she's good at handling this kind of attention.
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, I guess so. Imposing too many expectations on her would probably be rough on Artoria.
 
**Oberon:**
But, shouldering the hopes and dreams of the people is her specialty.
 
**Oberon:**
What do you think, Fujimaru? Should we pull Artoria out of the crowd?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She'll be alright.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's not making her usual face.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, you look happy, Fujimaru. Can you tell Artoria's behaving differently from usual?
 
**Oberon:**
Exactly. That's not the girl who lacks confidence in herself, or looks away while stammering.
 
**Oberon:**
...Yeah. This is Londinium. The city that dreams of a righteous future for Britain.
 
**Oberon:**
This is different from the self-serving, self-preserving dreams that have been foisted on her up until now.
 
**Oberon:**
What Artoria is experiencing right now are hearts without lies.
 
**Oberon:**
She's probably taking pride in being the Child of Prophecy for the first time in her life.
 
**Oberon:**
As if using one's hands to wipe eyes clouded by seeing far too much.
 
？1,1000,saveMaterial：What does that mean...?
 
**Oberon:**
Oh, just a hunch.
 
**Oberon:**
I am a fairy king after all. Aren't I allowed to wax poetic once in a while?
 
？2,2000,saveMaterial：...(Could it be that Artoria's and Oberon's eyes are...?)
 

---

 
**Percival:**
I'm sorry the residents kept you for so long. I hope you weren't too bothered by it.
 
**Artoria:**
No, it was no trouble at all. They were very good to me.
 
**Artoria:**
Please, let everyone know that I had a lot of fun!
 
**Artoria:**
However...
 
**Artoria:**
Muramasa is the only one missing. Is he still making friends with the residents?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Sorry to keep you waiting! I had a small errand to take care of.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
There's a workshop here, but it was in terrible shape. Worse off than Norwich's.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
They've got so many furnaces, and only one guy who can take care of them.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You should stop by later, Artoria. Wouldn't it be interesting to see what you can do to help fix them?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
There's a ton of quartz crystals. You can make as much glass as you like.
 
**Artoria:**
Really!? Great! I can't wait!
 
**Artoria:**
Or not. Percival is going to show us to the Round Table Army's war room right now.
 
**Artoria:**
As the Child of Prophecy Party, we have to restrain ourselves from any meaningless activity. Got it?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The “Child of Prophecy Party”? What are you acting all high and mighty for? You were too much of a coward to ring even one bell.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You're like a king being waited on...oh, I see. Like Knocknarea, I get it.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Your old friend turned out to be a genuine queen. So you can't afford to be careless.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, the difference in where your “raw materials” are is pretty clear! Too bad you're not nearly enough of a woman to be queen!
 
**Artoria:**
Muramasa! You're missing the point, Muramasa!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There are many types of kings.|
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Mm. That's true. Sorry, that was thoughtless of me.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Knocknarea's got a, what the hell is it? She's got a weird aura that's way too strong...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something like...that...isn't necessary to be queen in the first place.
 
**Artoria:**
That's right, Fujimaru. But what do you mean by “that”?
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Hahaha. You're very close, aren't you? And not just the two of you, everyone.
 
**Percival:**
I was worried that the Child of Prophecy might be shouldering a heavy burden, but...
 
**Percival:**
Looks like my fears were unfounded. We could learn from your example.
 
**Artoria:**
...No. It's the people of Londinium.
 
**Artoria:**
I've been to many cities up till now. The disparity of living conditions, dissatisfaction with Her Majesty...
 
**Artoria:**
There were many differences, but the point of “wanting someone to save them” was the same.
 
**Artoria:**
But the people of this city are different. Not only are people more truthful, but they don't rely on others.
 
**Artoria:**
I understood by talking to them just now.
 
**Artoria:**
The fairies stand up for the humans, and the humans stand up for the fairies.
 
**Artoria:**
They're determined to denounce Her Majesty for the sake of their neighbors, not just for themselves.
 
**Artoria:**
I'm sure they're the real “Knights of the Round Table.”
 
**Artoria:**
There are no upper or lower classes. Everyone stands side by side in cooperation.
 
**Percival:**
I don't know what a “Knight of the Round Table” is, but...
 
**Percival:**
It is true that the Round Table Army isn't an organization that's just “by humans, for humans.”
 
**Percival:**
We want to change the way things are for humans, but before that, we want to change the way things are in Britain.
 
**Percival:**
We're not humans or fairies. We just want a shared future.
 
**Percival:**
Lord Oberon gathered these kinds of people. I'm just another one of them.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Lord Oberon...?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oberon? Don't tell me...
 
**Habetrot:**
I did think he was strangely popular here...
 
**Percival:**
Yeah. The one who organized the Round Table Army was none other than Lord Oberon himself.
 
**Percival:**
He saved me when I had nowhere else to go, he removed the curse on Londinium,
 
**Percival:**
and he quickly and carefully recruited supporters for us from all throughout Britain.
 
**Percival:**
On top of that, every month he works hard to get us financial aid. Well, we hear about how deep in debt he is all over Britain.
 
**Percival:**
Many of the soldiers have the mistaken idea that I'm the one leading the Round Table Army,
 
**Percival:**
but I personally think Lord Oberon is the one leading us.
 
**Oberon:**
Quit talking about me like that. I've said it over and over, I'm just an investor.
 
**Oberon:**
You're the leader, Percival. The one who grew it so large is you.
 
**Percival:**
Heh, that's true. Let's put it that way.
 
**Percival:**
It's not luck we're blessed with good comrades, but the efforts of one person.
 
**Percival:**
Now that things are settled, let me show you to our headquarters.
 
**Percival:**
Security is tight, so right now the headquarters is the only place with a roof. ...Sorry about that.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Wait a second, Percival. What are these paintings on the wall?
 
**Percival:**
Painting...ah, that's a mural painted during the Fairy Calendar. We don't know anything else about it...
 
**Artoria:**
This is...six fairies and a large animal...? It looks like they're celebrating somehow, but...
 
**Artoria:**
I've never seen a creature like this in Britain...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Looks like more of a monster than an animal. Could it be a personification of the Calamity?
 
**Gareth:**
Hmm, I don't get that sense...I get a strong feeling that it's both charming and reliable.
 
**Habetrot:**
I feel the same way. Muramasa is a Heroic Spirit of pan-human history, so he can't feel the love put into this beast.
 
**Habetrot:**
You don't feel any dread from this mural if you're a fairy from Britain. If anything, you see it reflecting something grand.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Because I'm a pan-human history Heroic Spirit...?
 
**Da Vinci:**
...something grand, huh?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm not a fairy either, so I don't get the feeling Gareth and Habetrot do, but...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Percival. Could this mural possibly be religious?
 
**Percival:**
Religious...? Sorry, I don't really understand the term.
 
**Percival:**
This mural originally belonged to the fairies of Orkney... the Rain Clan.
 
**Percival:**
When Londinium was being built, this was brought in from the ruins of Orkney by the “Knight of Londinium”,
 
**Percival:**
or so the story goes.
 
**Percival:**
It shows the creation of Britain, and has a name in the old fairy tongue.
 
**Percival:**
“The Insect of the Abyss.”
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Insect of the Abyss...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This huge beast-like thing is...?
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
!|
 

---

 
**Percival:**
What is it, Fujimaru? Did you see someone strange over there?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...(It felt like someone was watching me from behind...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...No, it was just my imagination.
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Da Vinci. You said this was a religious painting. Are you saying this is a “god”?
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Possibly. The fairies here are clearly supposed to represent the six clans.
 
**Da Vinci:**
They're the ancestors of the fairies of Britain's Lostbelt.
 
**Da Vinci:**
They're worshipping...no, they're offering something to it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Then it's a higher being than the fairies...something you have to call a “god”.
 
**Oberon:**
Hm. But there aren't any gods in the Fairy Kingdom? Didn't I say that the cathedral was only for appearance's sake?
 
**Oberon:**
I've been to almost every city in the Fairy Kingdom gathering information, but there's no other murals like this one.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's why. This mural was painted before Morgan took control of Britain...before the Fairy Kingdom was founded.
 
**Gareth:**
Oh! It's talking about the Fairy Calendar, before the Queen's Calendar!
 
**Gareth:**
Huh? But does that mean...Her Majesty doesn't know about this mural?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No. She probably knew and deliberately left it out of history.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
As Queen, Morgan is now the sole target of the fairies' devotion...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The concept of a “god” is a hindrance to the rule of Britain, so by ignoring it, it's been erased.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Why do the Calamities occur? Why is there no god in Britain?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Maybe part of the answer can be found in this mural.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But it's too bad. There's something written on it, but since it's in old fairy script, it's beyond me.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Can you read it, Oberon?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right here, there's something that looks like a character for a single word.
 
**Oberon:**
...I'm ashamed.
 
**Oberon:**
I've somehow managed to read fairy script before now, but something this old is beyond me.
 
**Oberon:**
You'd need a civil servant working for Camelot to understand this...
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see. That's too bad.
 
**Percival:**
...It was something so valuable...sorry, I had no idea.
 
**Percival:**
We just left it outside until now, but we'll begin preparations to preserve it immediately.
 
**Percival:**
Let's recruit some people who know a lot about fairy history, and we'll start excavating the surrounding areas as well.
 
**Percival:**
Who knows what other valuable records might turn up?
 
**Oberon:**
That's good. If we take Norwich, we'll get some more skilled labor.
 
**Oberon:**
In any case, Londinium's restoration takes priority. The sooner we have a plan, the better.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Did you say... taking Norwich?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Percival:**
We're going to use this as the operations room.
 
**Percival:**
This was a room in the bell tower, selected for its panoramic view of Londinium.
 
**Percival:**
The room just downstairs is being used as a guest room, so you can all rest there.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, more importantly...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Were you serious about conquering Norwich?
 
**Artoria:**
The Round Table Army opposes the Queen.
 
**Artoria:**
You should be attacking Camelot. There's no sense in targeting the other cities.
 
**Percival:**
Yes. This goes against our creed. But we can't overlook the current state of Norwich.
 
**Percival:**
Thanks to your efforts, the Calamity was repelled. But afterwards...
 
**Percival:**
As soon as the Child of Prophecy departed for Camelot, Spriggan appealed to the Queen to dispatch troops.
 
**Percival:**
He claimed that the citizens of Norwich were supporting the Child of Prophecy and were showing defiance to the Queen.
 
**Percival:**
...He's just using you as an excuse to eliminate the fairies and reclaim the land.
 
**Percival:**
We only learned about this a day ago in a secret message from a human calling themselves “the Count”.
 
**Percival:**
The Queen's forces will probably reach Norwich tonight. We have perhaps two days to spare.
 
**Percival:**
We're currently recalling our like-minded compatriots back to Londinium from various operations across the land.
 
**Percival:**
As soon as they're all assembled, we begin our march to Norwich.
 
**Percival:**
Before Spriggan can begin his massacre, we'll storm Norwich's gate and take the city.
 
**Percival:**
Even if we're labelled as barbaric invaders.
 
**Oberon:**
It's a long shot. The people of Norwich won't be cooperative.
 
**Oberon:**
From the fairies' point of view, the Round Table Army is still seen as “an armed band of humans”.
 
**Oberon:**
They'll probably see no difference between being killed by Spriggan or the Round Table Army.
 
**Artoria:**
...An armed band...of humans...
 
**Gareth:**
...
 
**Percival:**
Please don't worry yourselves. This is something we all discussed and agreed upon together.
 
**Percival:**
This isn't your fight. Please, get some rest.
 
**Percival:**
No matter what, Londinium is safe. The Queen's magecraft won't reach here.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Oberon:**
Fujimaru.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Oberon...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I understand how Artoria feels...)
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(You want me to say it here...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(But if we miss this chance, you'll regret it.)
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Let's go ring the bell, Artoria.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...Yeah, I know...it's too demanding.
 
**Artoria:**
But I get it. I've made my choice as well.
 
**Artoria:**
Knight Percival. You never asked for my assistance, not even once.
 
**Artoria:**
Neither did the people of Londinium. They worried about me, they encouraged me...
 
**Artoria:**
But none of them asked for help. All they said was, “do your best.”
 
**Artoria:**
That's why&mdash;I'll play my role as well.
 
**Artoria:**
I cannot ring the bell of Norwich by myself. Everyone, please lend me your strength.
 
**Artoria:**
Show them the Round Table Army is not a mere band of armed humans,
 
**Artoria:**
but trusted allies of the Child of Prophecy, dedicated to the salvation of Britain.
 
**Percival:**
It would be my honor. &mdash;Thank you, Artoria.
 
**Percival:**
Whether or not our war will be just or evil is not my place to say, but&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
I swear on the lands of Britain that I will fight as your comrade without shame.
 
**Percival:**
The Round Table Army is made up of about 400 individuals, with both humans and fairies mixed together as a single company.
 
**Percival:**
I serve as commander. This is our main force.
 
**Percival:**
Besides that, we have five platoons of about 50 each.
 
**Percival:**
You'll meet them later,
 
**Percival:**
but there are the former knights of the Queen, Aurelia and Etwar, and the human knights Kenwood, Landon, and Karwas.
 
**Percival:**
The latter are the commanding officers of the platoon.
 
**Percival:**
In addition, like-minded individuals have gathered into five squads.
 
**Percival:**
Right now, they're in the middle of battlefield training. Their instruction has been entrusted to Secretary Magre, who you met before.
 
**Percival:**
Also, as you have seen, we have many non-combatants living in Londinium.
 
**Percival:**
Architects, clothiers, cooks, blacksmiths, administrators, teachers...
 
**Percival:**
We have about 300 people living here now, so we can't cover all our bases, but everyone is doing a great job.
 
**Percival:**
Furthermore, there's the schedule for the city's restoration plan, and the necessary collection of monthly resources...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Wait, hold it. Tell me all the details at some point later, Percival.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Stick to the plan for the assault on Norwich for now. Because, well...
 
**Gareth:**
Zzzzz...
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash; (Expression of someone desperately trying to stay well-behaved.)
 
**Da Vinci:**
You can see they've hit their limit. We've just been a party of seven up till now,
 
**Da Vinci:**
so you can't just suddenly start talking about managing a battalion of 1,000 people, alright? These things have to be done in stages.
 
**Percival:**
Y-you're right, I'm sorry. I was so happy to hear Lady Artoria's words earlier,
 
**Percival:**
I suddenly started blabbering on about ourselves... I'm so embarrassed...
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, I can understand why you might do that.
 
**Artoria:**
But please don't treat me with such respect. “Lady” is a little...
 
**Percival:**
I understand. Then I'll start over, Artoria.
 
**Percival:**
Heading to Norwich will be half my company and three platoons, about 400 soldiers in total.
 
**Percival:**
The Count is gathering anti-Queen...or, anti-Spriggan military police and residents in the city.
 
**Percival:**
We've heard it amounts to another 400.
 
**Percival:**
Put together, our military power comes to about 800.
 
**Percival:**
With these forces, we'll suppress the Queen's soldiers dispatched from Camelot,
 
**Percival:**
and head for the belltower...the tower Spriggan rechristened as the Vault Fortress.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
800, huh... Not enough to take the city, but enough to take that bastard's stronghold.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But you're facing fairies, and half your force is comprised of humans. Isn't the difference in strength too great?
 
**Percival:**
...Don't worry about that. The Round Table Army's tactics and weapons are geared towards anti-fairy combat.
 
**Percival:**
We know how to get around the difference in ability. That said...
 
**Percival:**
Taking the Vault Fortress will be beyond us.
 
**Percival:**
It's an impregnable iron tower that refuses entry to humans and fairies alike.
 
**Percival:**
Therefore, I'd like to ask for your help in taking it.
 
**Percival:**
Fujimaru. I've heard of your magecraft from Lord Oberon.
 
**Percival:**
He said that while you usually are alone, you can summon a force stronger than a platoon in battle.
 
**Percival:**
The gates of the Vault Castle can't be taken by an army. The only way is to break in and open them from the inside.
 
**Percival:**
It's a dangerous mission, but will you accept?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Nod)|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is my specialty. Artoria's as well.
 
**Artoria:**
Could you pleeeease stop bringing up Merlin's magecraft, Fujimaru!
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Thank you very much. I can see our victory now.
 
**Percival:**
The platoon operating in the south will be back by the evening. As soon as they return, we leave Londinium.
 
**Percival:**
We'll travel under cover of darkness, slip into Norwich before dawn, and take control of the city before Spriggan can counter us.
 
**Percival:**
It may be presumptuous, but I'll be taking command of the operation. Is that all right, Artoria?
 
**Artoria:**
Yes. We'll obey your orders. Please use us without restraint.
 
**Percival:**
Then I'll plan the operation with that in mind.
 
**Percival:**
We've also received a map of the city from the Count, so we can plan out our route to gain control.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Count Peperon really doesn't miss a thing...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's fundamentally a man who can just do anything...
 

---

 
**Percival:**
We have about three hours before we depart, so everyone, please feel free to get some rest.
 
**Habetrot:**
I see. Well, I'm off to the clothier's.
 
**Habetrot:**
There's a mountain of scraps to work with.
 
**Habetrot:**
I know we're busy, but with that I can make cute clothes for all the kids!
 
**Habetrot:**
So even if it's only for a short while, you can rely on me, Habenyan!
 
**Gareth:**
I've been apprenticed to Percival!
 
**Gareth:**
I'd really like it if you could teach me how to properly handle a lance in the training grounds!
 
**Percival:**
Of course, if only for a bit before the mission brief arrives.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I'm off to the forge to bug the brats there.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
There's only a single proper smith in the whole town. The rest are all just apprentices.
 
**Oberon:**
...Hm. I guess I'm out of work then?
 
**Oberon:**
I can't fight on the battlefield. You got anything on your mind, Percival?
 
**Percival:**
I want you to look into Oxford's movements.
 
**Percival:**
Woodwose is the most excitable of the clan heads.
 
**Percival:**
After we take Norwich, it's possible&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, I feel the same.
 
**Oberon:**
Let's keep him in check with Aurora's cooperation.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Aurora? Doesn't she only have a self-defense force, instead of an army?
 
**Oberon:**
An army isn't the only strength she can have, Da Vinci.
 
**Oberon:**
You see, Woodwose has a bit of a crush on Aurora these days.
 
**Oberon:**
If a beautiful woman who wouldn't even give you the time of day no matter how much you spoil her suddenly tells you “I want to see you right now,”...well?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you completely heartless, Oberon?|
 
**Oberon:**
Oh no. Despite what you might think, Aurora has her hobbies too. There's nothing wrong with showing Woodwose some appreciation.
 
**Oberon:**
...Actually, no. Aurora's a philanthropist, so she might accidentally go all the way with him.
 
**Oberon:**
I'll give her a warning first. If she's too nice to him, he'll get the wrong idea.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're toying with a man's heart!
 
**Oberon:**
No! If anything, I'm looking out for him!
 
**Oberon:**
Woodwose is awful at romance, so this is my chance to set him up for a date!
 
**Da Vinci:**
I've never met him, but I actually feel pretty bad for the guy now.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Welp, I'm off to Salisbury first. If all goes well, I'll see you in Norwich!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Then I'm off to chat with secretary Magre.
 
**Da Vinci:**
What about you, Fujimaru and Artoria?
 
**Artoria:**
I'll take Percival's advice and have a nap downstairs.
 
**Artoria:**
It looks like we'll be marching all night. We should refresh ourselves while we still can.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see. Then I'll do the same.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We should probably check on Red Rab-bit...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, he was left in the plaza surrounded by a bunch of kids.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's about time we went and rescued him.
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Then everyone, we meet back here in three hours.
 
**Percival:**
At sunset, we begin the operation to capture Norwich.
 
## Section 12: Norwich (II) 
 
**Percival:**
I was born in a farm and grew up in Salisbury.
 
**Percival:**
I guess they needed humans to fight the Mors.
 
**Percival:**
There were many other kids taken in besides me, and we were all treated very well.
 
**Percival:**
We didn't just get food, clothing, and shelter. A school was even made for us to attend.
 
**Percival:**
“There is no freedom for humans beyond the farm.”  That's what I had always heard, so I was surprised.
 
**Percival:**
Because of those experiences, I can't hold any ill will towards the fairies.
 
**Percival:**
It's because of that I ended up with a great physique and was granted this spear.
 
**Percival:**
But...
 
**Percival:**
I don't know much about the fairy that took me in.
 
**Percival:**
It's probably because they took in and raised so many human children.
 
**Percival:**
Around the time I became a full-fledged human soldier,
 
**Percival:**
I heard the fairy who had taken us all away from the farm had passed away.
 
**Percival:**
The school where we were all raised was closed down, and I left Salisbury.
 
**Percival:**
After that, I traveled around to hone my skills, and was working as a bodyguard in a certain forest,
 
**Percival:**
when I received a nomination for the Games in Camelot and was told “I'm sure you'll get good results.”
 
**Gareth:**
The Tournament of Robins five years ago, I heard about that! A human knight advanced all the way to the finals!
 
**Gareth:**
So that was you, Percival!?
 
**Percival:**
Yeah, I was lucky enough to make it that far. I didn't do so well at the end though.
 
**Percival:**
But I'm glad I was able to talk to Queen Morgan in person. That's how I was able to make my decision.
 
**Percival:**
The Queen saw humans and fairies alike as “tools”.
 
**Percival:**
She had no intention of reforming the Fairy Kingdom. After realizing this, I thought about it in my own way.
 
**Percival:**
I would create an organization that would support the Child of Prophecy that would soon appear.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ah, I see. Well, you started out as just a rebel.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Did Oberon put you in charge of the Round Table Army?
 
**Percival:**
Yes. We were working as guards protecting merchants from the Mors when Lord Oberon appeared.
 
**Percival:**
He told me, “you won't achieve anything doing that, Percival. Your painstakingly-cultivated white light will go rusty.”
 
**Percival:**
He then started managing us. Before I knew it, our rebel band had become the Round Table Army.
 
？1,1010,saveMaterial：I see. Oberon is a real smooth talker, huh!
？2,2010,saveMaterial：...(It happened that early...?)
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh? What's that “white light” you mentioned?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You can beat the crap out of fairies despite having a human's body, so it must be a pretty amazing skill...
 
**Percival:**
No. The white light is this spear.
 
**Percival:**
This is the Spear of Selection. It's a weapon Tonelico used to carry.
 
**Percival:**
The fairy who took me in gave it to me.
 
**Percival:**
They said, “this spear answers only to the innocent. It cannot be handled by fairies.”
 
**Habetrot:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Selection...is it the same as Artoria's staff?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
I wonder. They are a little different. One's a staff, and one's a spear.
 
**Artoria:**
I get the same feeling from it, but it has no “substance” anymore.
 
**Artoria:**
This spear is amazing, but I feel like it's not “chosen” anymore.
 
**Percival:**
You too? When I hold it, I get the same sensation.
 
**Percival:**
A strong feeling of sadness and regret that flows into me, and rips at my body.
 
**Percival:**
The lamentations in the spear pour out as magical energy, and shines like tears when it's swung.
 
**Percival:**
This is why it's called “white light”.
 
**Percival:**
This spear has become something that defeats fairies instead of saving them.
 
**Percival:**
In truth, it's not a weapon that should be used, but... it's the only thing that can stand up to the Fairy Knights.
 
**Percival:**
But it's said to be “only for the innocent.” Sooner or later, I won't be able to use it anymore.
 
**Gareth:**
That's not true! You're a fine, upstanding man, Percival!
 
**Gareth:**
You're the ideal knight, protecting the weak and reforming the selfish! There's no way you're guilty of anything!
 
**Gareth:**
If that was the case, I'd have been thrown in prison for the crime of weakness long ago!
 
**Percival:**
That's an exaggeration, but they say weakness is a sin, Gareth.
 
**Fairy Officer Aurelia:**
Percival, it'll be dawn soon. It took a forced march, but we made it in time.
 
**Fairy Officer Aurelia:**
Should we deploy as soon as we crest the hill?
 
**Percival:**
Yeah. I'm leaving command to Landon. I'd like you two to hold out for an hour.
 
**Percival:**
The Child of Prophecy and I will flank Norwich ahead of you.
 
**Percival:**
We'll get in through the sewer systems the Count opened up, and rendezvous with the anti-Spriggan forces in the city.
 
**Percival:**
We'll then start a riot inside and take advantage of the chaos to open the gate from inside.
 
**Percival:**
As soon as the gates open, your troops will wrest control of the ramparts from the Queen's soldiers.
 
**Percival:**
We'll then reconvene, spread out, and crush the remaining soldiers inside of Norwich.
 
**Percival:**
After all hostile enemies have been taken out, we'll surround the Vault Fortress.
 
**Fairy Officer Aurelia:**
Understood. Don't get too reckless, Commander...
 
**Percival:**
Same to you, Aurelia. Sorry to leave you with the difficult job again.
 
**Fairy Officer Aurelia:**
I've gotten used to it. Child of Prophecy, take care of Percival.
 
**Percival:**
You heard the plan. From here on, we're on our own.
 
**Percival:**
Before daybreak, we'll sneak into Norwich and make a big ruckus.
 
**Percival:**
This will be a long battle. I hope you're prepared, Fujimaru.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Count Peperon:**
Welcome, welcome! You're right on time, Fujimaru!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Count Peperon!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You came to meet us in person! Thanks!
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
I'm the one who asked this favor, so I'd show up whether you came in through the sewer or the morgue.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Let's see, the ones who came in are...
 
**Count Peperon:**
Miss Da Vinci, little ol' Muramasa and Gareth, Habetrot, and...
 
**Count Peperon:**
OH MY GOODNESS!!!
 
**Percival:**
An enemy!?
 
**Count Peperon:**
What!? Where!? Where are they!? Oh I'm scared! Save me, Percy-boy!
 
**Percival:**
Percy-boy!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We really don't have time for this.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Use his real name, Pepe.
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
...Right. Sorry about that.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I've never seen his type before, so I got a little carried away.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Welcome to the sewers of Norwich. You're Percival of the Round Table Army, right?
 
**Count Peperon:**
I'm Count Peperonna. Just call me Count.
 
**Percival:**
Ah, you're...I'm sorry for my rudeness. I thought you were some kind of Fairy Deadlord living under Norwich...
 
**Percival:**
It's a pleasure to meet you. I am Percival of the Round Table Army.
 
**Percival:**
You have my thanks for bringing the crisis here to our attention.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I should be thanking you. You're the ones who will be shedding your own blood.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Oh, there's one missing. Where's that kiddo, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean Oberon?|
 
**Count Peperon:**
Oberon doesn't set foot on a battlefield. He's more of a chess grandmaster type, putting all the pieces in the right place.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I'm talking about that spirited little bunny, Red Rab-bit.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You mean Rab-bit?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Yes. That spunky colt.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Red Rab-bit stayed behind in Londinium. He said he wouldn't come if he couldn't pull his carriage.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Oh, what a shame...though, he might actually be pretty smart. That must be Aurora's upbringing at work.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Well, shall I show you the way? Once we're above ground, we'll split into two groups.
 
**Count Peperon:**
B Team will draw the Queen's soldiers into the main street, and C Team will open the main gate.
 
**Count Peperon:**
B Team will be Artoria and Muramasa, C Team will be Percival, Gareth, and Habetrot.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Chaldea...Fujimaru and Da Vinci should support both teams.
 
**Count Peperon:**
We're outnumbered, so if you don't run around, both teams will be overrun.
 
**Count Peperon:**
You can do that much, can't you? You've come this far, after all.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Of course.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see there's no A Team.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Maybe one day! When you finally get big enough, Fujimaru,
 
**Count Peperon:**
you, me, and Kadoc can call ourselves the A Team! Oh, that will be such fun!
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Understood. Then&mdash;
 
**Count Peperon:**
Yes. So begins the Battle of Norwich. Let's run Spriggan down.
 
**Spriggan's Guard:**
Lord Spriggan! The Round Table Army has begun assaulting the main gate!
 
**Spriggan:**
...Hmm.
 
**Spriggan:**
The Round Table Army is different from other rebel groups. They are fundamentally a proper army, in their own way.
 
**Spriggan:**
There is no way they would assault the walls with merely 300 men. Perhaps...
 
**Spriggan's Guard:**
Milord, we have a report from soldiers stationed in the city! Residents are up in arms throughout the city!
 
**Spriggan's Guard:**
The resistance has raised their flag against the Queen. And with them is...
 
**Spriggan:**
Is the Child of Prophecy among them?
 
**Spriggan's Guard:**
Sir! She is why the citizens' morale is so high, and the soldiers are at a loss as for what to do!
 
**Spriggan:**
...Heh. Kuheheh...Hahahahahah!
 
**Spriggan:**
Aaahaahaahah! Ah, how perfect!
 
**Spriggan's Guard:**
M-milord...? Please calm yourself, we need your orders&mdash;
 
**Spriggan:**
Worry not, I have perfect command of my faculties. Relay this to the soldiers.
 
**Spriggan:**
“Stay at your posts until the Queen's army is overrun. After that, either surrender or fall back to the Vault Fortress.”
 
**Spriggan:**
“Keep from harming the citizens as much as possible. Stay on the defensive.”
 
**Spriggan:**
Understood? Only the Queen's soldiers will fight the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Spriggan:**
We are merely protecting Norwich. Think of it that way.
 
**Spriggan:**
And have the bell tower garrison stand down. I'll greet the {(M)boy/(F)girl} there.
 
**Spriggan's Guard:**
Yessir!
 
**Spriggan:**
Now&mdash;it's time to show us what you can do.
 
**Spriggan:**
I'm counting on you, Fujimaru of Chaldea. Everything depends on you.
 
**Spriggan:**
If the Child of Prophecy has even a chance of winning, then investing in her isn't a bad idea.
 
**Spriggan:**
I'm getting sick of deceiving the eyes of all these fairies anyway.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Right! We're just about done here! We'll take care of the rest on our own!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Head for the gate ahead of us, Fujimaru! Don't rely on Percival!
 
**Artoria:**
Gareth tends to bite off more than she can chew, so please look out for her!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Copy that!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Both of you, be careful!
 

---

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Round Table Army Soldier A:**
Report from Captain Landon! We've gained total control of the south district!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier B:**
Report from Captain Aurelia!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier B:**
The Queen's forces surrounding the main gate have lost 20% of their forces and have withdrawn!
 
**Percival:**
All right, advance to the north district! We're heading for the Vault Fortress!
 
**Percival:**
Take the ones who surrendered into custody and leave them with Aurelia's unit!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Sir, yes sir!
 
**Gareth:**
Haah...haah...
 
**Habetrot:**
...I'm beat...this is harder...than I thought...
 
**Percival:**
Gareth, Habetrot, you two stay here.
 
**Percival:**
Muramasa, Artoria, Da Vinci, Fujimaru.
 
**Percival:**
We'll break into the Vault Fortress ourselves. All clear?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Good or bad, I'm coming regardless. I want my shot at Spriggan.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. Just one more push...!|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
So lively. Good thing I went to the effort to prepare a way in.
 
**Count Peperon:**
None of the Queen's soldiers are stationed at the Vault Fortress. From now on, we'll only be facing Spriggan's guards...
 
**Count Peperon:**
&mdash;Wait. Is the fortress door already open?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Actually it looks like there's no soldiers inside. Has even the bell tower been left undefended?
 
**Percival:**
...!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it...a trap?|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
...Well, yeah, probably. But not one set for us.
 
**Count Peperon:**
This is a trap for Artoria...for the Child of Prophecy and for Queen Morgan.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Spriggan's a shrewd one. He's offering us the bell himself.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Well, I'm not sure what to make of it, but he probably thinks there's no profit in protecting the bell.
 
**Count Peperon:**
He's probably trying to surrender. And in such a way that doesn't appear to be rebelling against the Queen.
 
**Count Peperon:**
He'll be saying, “it was the Child of Prophecy who rang the bell, I had nothing to do with it.”
 
**Percival:**
...This is unexpected.
 
**Percival:**
I thought we wouldn't be able to take over Norwich without ringing the bell.
 
**Percival:**
Spriggan is withdrawing his forces. He's showing that he no longer has the will to fight.
 
**Percival:**
In terms of gaining control of Norwich, we've already finished. There's no need to ring the bell anymore.
 
**Percival:**
But...
 
**Count Peperon:**
What comes next is up to the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Count Peperon:**
If you ring it, there's no turning back. The real war will begin.
 
**Count Peperon:**
...It peeves me to play into his hands, but this is the best chance we'll get.
 
**Artoria:**
...Let's do it. The bell aside, Spriggan's in there.
 
**Artoria:**
From the way he handled the Calamity, and now this, we can't let him run loose anymore.
 
**Artoria:**
I want to know exactly what he thinks he's doing... as the leader of the Earth Clan.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We've seen none of his soldiers, to say nothing of Spriggan himself. It was almost too easy to get this far.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...this is giving me some really bad vibes. There's something in here. Be careful.
 
**???:**
Oooh...oooooooh...
 
**???:**
Capless...Capless...where are you...Capless...
 
**???:**
I can smell Paradise...I can hear Avalon...I see... you've finally come...
 
**Percival:**
Ah! Magical energy is converging on the ceiling! This density...it's a Nightcall!
 
**Fairy Deadlord:**
...The one who will save us...the one who will unfasten Britain...
 
**Fairy Deadlord:**
Oooh...my dead flesh is accursed...but the Earth Clan will gladly give up their souls...
 
**Fairy Deadlord:**
...Yes. In exchange for your abominable flesh and blood!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Percival:**
...It's completely dissipated. Seems like it remained here as a Fairy Deadlord for a long time...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Probably didn't have a very good death. May you rest in peace now, old man.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, it doesn't seem like there's anything left in our way. All that's left is to ring the bell...
 
**???:**
Oh, splendid, simply splendid!
 
**???:**
You've done a wonderful job exorcising the wraith haunting this tower for the last 100 years.
 
**Spriggan:**
This is exactly what it means to solve a problem quickly and skillfully. Truly the most heartwarming sight since I came to this Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Spriggan:**
I, Spriggan, am enthralled by your power once more.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Spriggan&mdash;!|
 

---

 
**Spriggan:**
Oh? It seems the air is still hostile. Even though the battle is over.
 
**Spriggan:**
The Round Table Army has defeated the Queen's soldiers sent to Norwich.
 
**Spriggan:**
Thanks to you, Norwich has been freed from the Queen's tyranny.
 
**Spriggan:**
As the city's lord, I could not be more pleased.
 
**Spriggan:**
What do you say? Allow us to toast your victory.
 
**Spriggan:**
Oh, are you lacking in etiquette? My apologies, how insensitive of me.
 
**Spriggan:**
If you are leaving, then please do not mind me. My soldiers will make way for you.
 
**Percival:**
...I heard it was you who asked for aid from the Queen's army.
 
**Percival:**
And now you're saying you have nothing to do with them.
 
**Spriggan:**
I have certainly conveyed so to Her Majesty. Norwich was badly damaged by the Calamity.
 
**Spriggan:**
I requested soldiers to assist with the reconstruction. This is only the natural act for a lord.
 
**Spriggan:**
It seems that some of them were rather harsh in their actions subduing the rebels,
 
**Spriggan:**
but you prevented that as well. You have my thanks.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You're saying that the Count's tip we got that said you intended to purge all the anti-Queen rebels here was wrong?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fine. We have no way to verify that now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But what will you do now?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Your city has been conquered. The citizens' frustration with you has boiled over.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Do you really have the leeway to be chewing the fat with us?
 
**Spriggan:**
How can you say that? You are quite the mean-spirited one, Leonardo da Vinci.
 
**Spriggan:**
It is true that Norwich has been conquered, but that is merely temporary.
 
**Spriggan:**
If the Round Table Army is being led by the Child of Prophecy, then your only objective is this bell.
 
**Spriggan:**
You should have no intention of taking control of Norwich for yourselves.
 
**Spriggan:**
Well, if you plan to use it as your base, that is a different story...
 
**Spriggan:**
This city is not defensible in the least.
 
**Spriggan:**
But if you prefer to repeat the mistakes of Sheffield, then I will not stop you.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
Ah ah ah, no point in that. No need to deal with him.
 
**Oberon:**
It would be a waste of time questioning him about his crimes.
 
**Oberon:**
Because he doesn't think he's done a single thing wrong.
 
**Artoria:**
Oberon!? When did you get here?
 
**Oberon:**
Just now. The trick with the restaurant worked pretty well.
 
**Oberon:**
Glad to see everything went well here too. As expected of Percival.
 
**Oberon:**
But there's nothing more to be done.
 
**Oberon:**
If you couldn't kill Spriggan during the confusion of the battle, then now you must leave him be.
 
**Oberon:**
Unless, of course, you want to lose control of Norwich. You don't want that, do you?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lose control of Norwich...?|
 

---

 
**Spriggan:**
Oh? Must I explain it to you, {(M)Lord/(F)Lady} Foreign Magus?
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, no. I'll sum it up.
 
**Oberon:**
Spriggan's shown his neutrality to the citizens. He's done his “job” as Lord.
 
**Oberon:**
For this reason, the fairies still see him as one.
 
**Oberon:**
Therefore, if you kill him while he's open to negotiations, the citizens will be angered.
 
**Oberon:**
That's not all. The craftsmen who live here hate the guy, but the citizens who aren't...
 
**Oberon:**
The ones using the craftsmen here can't make do without Spriggan.
 
**Oberon:**
Remember how Norwich is in the middle of becoming a city of humans?
 
**Oberon:**
For those who want to make money, Spriggan's policies are a must.
 
**Oberon:**
He's a skeevy son of a bitch who's got half of the people here backing him and the other half calling for his hide.
 
**Oberon:**
We can't just kill him without reason. We're more likely to raise the public's ire that way.
 
**Oberon:**
More importantly&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
Without Spriggan to negotiate with the Queen, Norwich will be occupied by the Queen's forces as a rebel stronghold.
 
**Percival:**
We can't protect this city. Norwich will be destroyed... is that what you're saying?
 
**Spriggan:**
Quite so. No matter what, when you kill the head of state, you kill the country.
 
**Spriggan:**
If you wish for Norwich's destruction, then you should execute me here and now.
 
**Artoria:**
...This isn't a bluff. You're being serious.
 
**Artoria:**
You don't care about the safety of the Earth Clan, and you don't want to protect Norwich.
 
**Artoria:**
But you don't value your own life either. I don't understand...
 
**Artoria:**
I can't understand what your objective is. You're acting like a&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes, like a human. You're no fairy, Spriggan.
 
**Da Vinci:**
A Changeling who drifted into the Fairy Kingdom of Britain from pan-human history...right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...(...I had a feeling, but...)
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Don't even joke about that...there's no way a clan head could disguise something like that!
 
**Da Vinci:**
For fairies, the distinction between human and fairy comes down to smell, magical energy, and looks.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Each fairy has their own unique look. So if there are fairies who “look like humans,”
 
**Da Vinci:**
if you can clear those three hurdles, then you can pass yourself off as one. For the scent you can make perfume.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The amount of magical energy you have can be falsified by wearing a Mystic Code. And as for your looks&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, if only your ears look close enough...|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
If you just perform cosmetic surgery on your extremities, then the human body won't be adversely affected.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The only thing I'm wondering about is your age. It's been 100 years since you became Lord of Norwich.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You can only hide aging so much. What's going on under that makeup?
 
**Spriggan:**
Well, I don't know what you could possibly be talking about. But I'll indulge you.
 
**Spriggan:**
Suppose I was a human from the same lands as Master Fujimaru.
 
**Spriggan:**
Does that give you some idea of what my objective might be?
 
**Spriggan:**
I would have no attachment to the Queen, fairies, or Britain in the least.
 
**Spriggan:**
However, I am no longer able to return to where I came from. I could no longer even return to being who I was before.
 
**Spriggan:**
What's most important to me is&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...A home where you feel safe.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Nothing aside from this Vault Fortress.
 

---

 
**Spriggan:**
You're rather out of touch with reality, but you get the general idea.
 
**Spriggan:**
Who sits on the throne makes no difference to me, be it Her Majesty or the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Spriggan:**
So long as I can protect this Vault Fortress. I am the Lord of Norwich, after all.
 
**Spriggan:**
Nevertheless, the trick to surviving is to serve the strongest.
 
**Spriggan:**
For now I serve Her Majesty. &mdash;What happens next depends on you.
 
**Oberon:**
See? He's not your ally nor your enemy. Guys like this are the absolute worst to deal with.
 
**Oberon:**
Well, as long as the bell is rung, we have no need for Norwich. It's a town without an army after all.
 
**Oberon:**
No matter how far they go, Spriggan's forces are just a private army. They're no threat to the Round Table Army even if we ignore them.
 
**Spriggan:**
Indeed. Do you all understand? Is there no value in killing me? Splendid.
 
**Spriggan:**
Then the jester will hide himself in the corner of the stage. Please use the Pilgrim's Bell as you please.
 
**Spriggan:**
...But, that's right. Jesters should be jesters in their own way.
 
**Spriggan:**
When the Child of Prophecy casts down the Queen, my days will be numbered.
 
**Oberon:**
Now, let's get down to business. Artoria, have you made up your mind?
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
(Salisbury...Gloucester...Norwich...and Londinium.)
 
**Artoria:**
(The city of wind where human and fae live together... the glamorous, yet lonesome city of flowers...)
 
**Artoria:**
(The city of smiths, where fairies and humans came together to compete, deceive, and help each other...)
 
**Artoria:**
(And the abandoned city...full of injured, anxious people, who yet thought of others with a smile...)
 
**Artoria:**
(...Sixteen years. The time I spent in Tintagel as the Child of Prophecy...)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...(watch in silence.)
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Right. I'll ring the bell.
 
**Artoria:**
I know what I need to do. Everybody, please stand back.
 
**Artoria:**
“The song of Paradise. The Chant of the Inner Sea. That which is born chosen, predestined, confirmed.”
 
**Artoria:**
“The Bone Bell of Beginnings, showing the lost child the way home. &mdash;Their sins, be forgiven.”
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
What, isn't it too early for lunch? Wait, that's not the cathedral's hourly chime, is it?
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
...That's weird. I feel strangely happy, yet sad...
 
**Coral:**
...A nostalgic sound that makes my heart wrench... Lady Aurora. Could this be the Pilgrim's Bell?
 
**Aurora:**
Yes. The bell of Norwich, signalling the Earth Clan's acknowledgement.
 
**Aurora:**
Hehe...it seems that thing went well, Oberon. I feel a bit sorry for Woodwose, though...
 
**Aurora:**
Congratulations, Artoria. Thank you, Fujimaru.
 
**Aurora:**
Now we too can finally move forward as well.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
(...This sound...it seems to be resonating throughout all of Britain...)
 
**Koyanskaya:**
(This wavelength...it's more like joy...)
 
**Koyanskaya:**
(...It makes sense now. That's what they meant by “pilgrim”...)
 
**Muryan:**
&mdash;The first.
 
**Muryan:**
I'm relieved. That girl is finally showing her worth as the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Muryan:**
I wondered what was going to happen when she accepted that invitation to Camelot&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
Hehe, now the war really begins! I'm looking forward to this, Koyanskaya!
 
**Muryan:**
Her Majesty or the Child of Prophecy, the Fairy Knights or the Round Table Army!
 
**Muryan:**
Who will fall first! Who will have the last laugh!
 
**Muryan:**
Who will you bet on, Koyanskaya! Ah, could Chaldea be the dark horse?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Chaldea has no chance of winning. After all, they're not even a piece on the board this time.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
However&mdash;indeed.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
For you, betting on Chaldea is not a bad choice.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
After all, from here on out, stock in the Fairy Kingdom is going to crash, and hard.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
If you know that, don't you think you should look into alternatives?
 
**Muryan:**
Don't be silly. After preparing the board for this long, there is no way I'm dropping out of the game.
 
**Muryan:**
&mdash;Just watch, Koyanskaya. No matter what happens, I will carry out my justice.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
...Lady Muryan.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Huh, so that's the sound of the Pilgrim's Bell. It doesn't resonate with anything in my soul, but...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Good thing Norwich caved in. Looks like that girl finally grew some backbone.
 
**Knocknarea:**
That's how my rival should be. Just ring a bell or two for me, would you?
 
**Fairy Official:**
Th-this awful sound...is this the sound of the Pilgrim's Bell!?
 
**Fairy Official:**
What of the soldiers sent to Norwich!? What does Lord Spriggan have to say for himself!?
 
**Fairy Ambassador:**
It's the Child of Prophecy! That girl collaborated with the Round Table Army to invade Norwich!
 
**Fairy Ambassador:**
What in the world was Woodwose doing!?
 
**Fairy Ambassador:**
How could he miss the Round Table Army marching while in Oxford!?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
It's just as Beryl Gut said! We should have captured and killed her when we had the chance!
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Quiet. Quiet, please.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
The 30 ambassadors and 100 government officials gathered here will cease their discussion.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
It is the edict of Her Majesty, Queen Morgan. It is the mantra of Her Majesty, Queen Morgan.
 
**Morgan:**
The pilgrim's bell has been rung. Tell all the lords. Tell all the fairies.
 
**Morgan:**
From here on, I no longer recognize the Child of Prophecy as a subject of mine.
 
**Morgan:**
She is now an enemy of the Fairy Kingdom. Those who join her are to be considered the same.
 
**Morgan:**
In my Fairy Kingdom, such enemies are to be crushed. To be destroyed. They deserve not even a shred of mercy.
 
**Morgan:**
I hereby order Woodwose, the Lord of Oxford, to assault Londinium.
 
**Morgan:**
The result of this battle will determine the charge of neglecting the march on Norwich.
 
**Morgan:**
Hearken. There is no land in Britain that shall welcome the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Ooh, Her Majesty the Queen has made her decree! The evil of the Child of Prophecy comes to an end here...!)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(War! A war has begun! Oh man, this is gonna be so much fun!)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(The last century has been so dull! I'll be able to hear the screams of those squirming low-class fairies again!)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Thank you, Child of Prophecy! Thank you, Round Table Army! Thank you for letting us kill each other again!)
 
**Morgan:**
...Hmph. When they saw they could prepare for war, they all raced to be the first one back.
 
**Morgan:**
So easily bored, so easily bloodthirsty. Two thousand years, yet fairies remain the same as ever.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Portunes. Awaken, Knight Portunes.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Sire. Guard Knight Portunes, at your command. It is an honor to be released from the chessboard.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
It has been 200 years, yet Her Majesty's beauty has not diminished in the slightest...
 
**Morgan:**
A fine greeting. As for the current state of the kingdom&mdash;drink. This is the Water of Conveyance, containing a record of the last 200 years.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Then, if I may be so bold&mdash;
 
**Knight Portunes:**
...I understand. The Child of Prophecy, that bothersome prophecy left behind by my lady Ainsel...
 
**Knight Portunes:**
What of the rest of the Mirror Clan? Who is the current head after Ainsel?
 
**Morgan:**
Every last one of them has vanished. You are the last of your kind, Portunes.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
That's...quite an ironic fate.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
To think that I would be the survivor after parting ways with Ainsel and becoming Her Majesty's knight.
 
**Morgan:**
This is the best future someone like you could see.
 
**Morgan:**
You judged correctly. The truth is you survived long enough to see this year.
 
**Morgan:**
Now put your crisis-avoiding foresight to good use.
 
**Morgan:**
You will be aiding Fairy Knights Gawain and Lancelot.
 
**Morgan:**
If the time comes...you understand your part?
 
**Knight Portunes:**
...Yes. We of the Royal Guard understand the will of Her Majesty.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
You want the two Fairy Knights to conquer Londinium... but first they will be stationed at Oxford, correct?
 
**Morgan:**
Has your mind grown dull as well? Woodwose is sufficient for Londinium.
 
**Morgan:**
The Fairy Knights will be given a different mission.
 
**Morgan:**
...There are other bugs to squash. The attack on Londinium is but a sideshow.

**Fujimaru 1:**
At last, the bell...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria...!?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Eeh? Whaaaaaaaaat!? I'm glowing!? I'm glowing all over&ndash;!?
 
**Oberon:**
Water, get some water! She's hot, she's about to burst into flames!
 
**Oberon:**
Da Vinci, don't you have some rapid-cooling thing or something!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I did as a grown-up, but not now~!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's cooled down, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What the heck was that just now?
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Y-yeah. Sorry, I lost it myself there for a second. That wasn't part of the prophecy, so...
 
**Oberon:**
Still...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, I know...that was...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, you're right...it's...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I might not be a fairy, but I get it...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...When you look at me that way, I start to feel anxious...
 
**Artoria:**
Did I do something...?
 
**S：Everyone else:**
No, it's not that&mdash;
 
**S：Everyone else:**
Artoria, aren't you feeling incredibly strong?
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;?
 
## Fragment / 5 
 
**Mash:**
Nn... My body is tingling all over&mdash; what happened&mdash;
 
**???:**
Whoa! Whoaaa!
 
**???:**
She's awake! She's awake!
 
**???:**
She's waking up, Tonelico! The weird person! The one wearing the iron armor!
 
**???:**
Can I beat her up? Can I beat her up? She's definitely a bad fairy!
 
**Mash:**
Habetrot! I'm glad you're safe!
 
**Mash:**
Thank goodness...there was an awful lightning strike and I thought Norwich might've burned down...
 
**???:**
No-witch? What are you even talking about? Did you come from those woods there?
 
**Mash:**
Huh&mdash;This is, the coast...? Where's Norwich&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Where's Senpai, and Artoria&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
What in the world happened, Habetrot!? What happened in Norwich&mdash;
 
**B：???:**
What the hell is Nowitch!? Never heard of it! And that isn't my name!
 
**B：???:**
I am Totrot, Fairy Knight Totrot! Don't mistake me for someone else, don't you dare!
 
**Mash:**
Huh? Tot...rot...? Are you not... Habenyan?
 
**Totrot:**
&mdash;Habe&mdash;nyan?
 
**Totrot:**
That sounds way better! Better than the cries of a Grimalkin!
 
**Totrot:**
Tonelico, Tonelico! This is amazing, this girl's amazing!
 
**Totrot:**
She speaks amazing words! I don't even know what they mean, but they're amazing! She's definitely a mage like you!
 
**Tonelico:**
Yes yes, let's stop lumping in magecraft with things you simply haven't heard of, Totrot.
 
**Tonelico:**
Hello, nice to meet you. I am Tonelico, and this is Totrot.
 
**Tonelico:**
And this is Britain, Land of the Fae. Can you tell us your name, stranger?
 
**Tonelico:**
It is destiny that we met here. If the stars align, we may be able to lend you our strength.
 
**Mash:**
Y-yes&mdash;my name is Mash Kyrielight...
 
**Mash:**
Tonelico. Are you...the savior Tonelico&mdash;?
 
**Tonelico:**
Wow. So you know who I am. Are you from Londinium?
 
**Tonelico:**
But I must have at least caught word of a fairy as powerful as you...
 
**Tonelico:**
Hmm... I came to the eastern shore because I detected a great magecraft being used here, similar to that of the Infinity Mirror.
 
**Tonelico:**
Oh. Are you perhaps a fairy from the north?
 
**Tonelico:**
Did your transport fail, and you got flung out in the middle of nowhere like this?
 
**Totrot:**
A fairy from the north!? Are you an ally of Mab!? How can that be, when you're this cute!?
 
**Totrot:**
Then, she is our enemy! Should we attack her, Tonelico?!
 
**Tonelico:**
Of course not. Shut your mouth for a second, Totrot.
 
**Tonelico:**
Let's relocate for now, Mash. Our camp is in the woods over there.
 
**Tonelico:**
We could be rudely interrupted by the Mors around here, so let's continue talking in a safer place.
 
**Narration:**
So, let's continue with this side of the story, shall we?
 
**Narration:**
Mash, having protected Fujimaru and Artoria,
 
**Narration:**
was spirited away by Morgan's Water Mirror.
 
**Narration:**
After a moment of darkness, she woke up on a beach she had never before seen.
 
**Narration:**
Thick fog all around obscured her view, and the sound of crashing waves filled her ears.
 
**Narration:**
On the northern horizon was a Fantasy Tree that had grown tall enough to reach the heavens. The fairies called it the World Tree.
 
**Narration:**
And what surprised her more than anything was that&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;There aren't any walls! There isn't a wall of light surrounding Britain anywhere...!
 
**Narration:**
Nothing existed around the island of Britain, except for a sea of white.
 
**Narration:**
This was the island of Britain around 2,400 years before Mash's arrival in the year 2017 of the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Narration:**
The year 400 of the Fairy Calendar. The story of the Age of Destiny, and the last battle of the Savior known as Tonelico.
 
## Section 13: Wales (II) 
 
**Artoria Caster:**
...Ah, I can hear the tolling of the bells...
 
**Artoria Caster:**
...Even though half a day has passed...even though everyone praises me with smiling faces.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
...I want to close my eyes and grab the back of my head.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
...Over and over, over and over, can I hear the bells ringing.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
Another Britain, likely in pan-human history. There is not a mage, nor a fairy,
 
**Artoria Caster:**
but an entirely distinct, imposing version of myself, seemingly a hybrid of human and dragon.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
Artoria Pendragon.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
The one who united the lords of the island, who defended Britain from foreign invasion.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
The one who built the Chalk Castle of Camelot. An ideal king.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
Trusted by all, loved by all,
 
**Artoria Caster:**
righteous above all else, radiant above all else.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
With the twelve Knights of the Round Table, her many loyal soldiers, and with ■ ■ ■ ■  ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ in hand, she was a king who created numerous futures.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
...Truly magnificent. I have never seen anything like her.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
I don't want to see her. I don't want to be shown her. She's too much. I don't want to believe it. I don't want to acknowledge it.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
&mdash;After all.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
She has no equal. Takes no refuge. No one who understands her. None who can comfort her.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
She receives no reward. No goals. No rest. She cannot afford failure, not even a single mistake.
 
**Artoria Caster:**
Ah&mdash;from the bottom of my heart, I think: “No.”
 
**Artoria Caster:**
Just how cruel must it be for everyone to smile and acknowledge a king like that?
 
**Artoria:**
...Morning. I see, the sun rose while we were on the move...
 
**Artoria:**
I had the most amazing dream. Maybe it was because I rang the Pilgrim's Bell.
 
**Artoria:**
............................................................ ............................................................Ah.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Who would want to live like that?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's quite lavish, even with the carriage bouncing around...|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Sunrise, and only a bit further until we reach Londinium! Good thing our return trip didn't hit any snags!
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah. We traveled under cover of darkness when we went to Norwich, so we wouldn't be seen.
 
**Oberon:**
They prepared this carriage for our return trip.
 
**Oberon:**
The Queen might have banned animal labor, but there's no real punishment for doing it.
 
**Oberon:**
I guess it's a trend. Only the clan heads do it now, but sooner or later everyone's going to be doing it.
 
**Oberon:**
But why did the Queen ban carriages? Does she just really like horses?
 
**Habetrot:**
There is that, but it's more a warning to the fairies. If horse-drawn carriages become the norm, fairy horses won't be born.
 
**Habetrot:**
We fairies are simple-minded in our cruelty, you know.
 
**Habetrot:**
Once something becomes popular as “that sort of thing,” we don't want anything else.
 
**Habetrot:**
We're serious about mimicking human culture, and it's already 2017, right?
 
**Habetrot:**
The fact that Red Rab-bit and Percival's favorite horse Kundry are doing so well is due to Morgan's concern.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ah, I see...so there's such a thing as “Mystery Maintenance.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
Copying human society is fine, but as for the fairy ecosystem...or rather, their phylogenetic tree?
 
**Da Vinci:**
She won't allow this “cultural imitation” to start pruning off its branches, will she?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...she's shrewd.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So she's not just a tyrant who drains her people of their lifespan once a year.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...Artoria doesn't look so well...)|
 
**Oberon:**
(...Ha, that's my cue from Fujimaru!)
 
**Oberon:**
No, Morgan is a monstrous queen!
 
**Oberon:**
It's just like her to do something nice to make you think she's a good person!
 
**Artoria:**
Oberon?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But the fairies in the woods of Wales...
 
**Oberon:**
You raise a good point. The Queen isn't concerned about the future of fairykind.
 
**Artoria:**
Oberon...?
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Remember the fairies in my territory, the forests of Wales?
 
**Oberon:**
It's the only land in Britain with the colors of autumn. All the fairies driven there are weaklings.
 
**Oberon:**
Those without a place in the Fairy Kingdom. Those that fled to escape harsh treatment.
 
**Oberon:**
Those that were persecuted simply for being, told not to “spread their evil influence.”
 
**Oberon:**
Insect-type fairies who lost their homes due to Morgan's hatred of bugs.
 
**Oberon:**
Small, simple-minded fairies of low intelligence, unable to enter the society of the Fairy Kingdom focused on mimicking human culture.
 
**Oberon:**
All these fairies gather, cling together and die without hope in my forest.
 
**Gareth:**
...That's true. Her Majesty's Britain does not suffer the weak or those without worth...
 
**Gareth:**
She's a ruler who values not the fairies living in the country, but the country itself...
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah. But it's not like you're unwanted because you have no worth.
 
**Oberon:**
Those that have no place to go anymore.
 
**Oberon:**
Those that can only rot away, hated and forgotten.
 
**Oberon:**
In the middle of their forest, I was summoned.
 
**Oberon:**
In a land that won't permit any sort of intervention by pan-human history, my summoning was especially dangerous.
 
**Oberon:**
I couldn't move my arms and legs and had to sleep it off.
 
**Oberon:**
If I had been on my own, I would have likely disappeared then and there.
 
**Oberon:**
Remember when I told you before I had only a cape when I came here? Well that was a lie.
 
**Oberon:**
I didn't even have that. It was kinda cold.
 
**Oberon:**
But it wasn't scary or lonely.
 
**Welsh Fairies:**

**Oberon:**
They couldn't touch me, but they formed a tight circle around me,
 
**Oberon:**
trembling in excitement, waiting for me to open my eyes.
 
**Oberon:**
What, don't you perk up when someone helps you out?
 
**Oberon:**
I used the sound of their voices to stay conscious, and eventually my Saint Graph stabilized to the point where I was able to wake up.
 
**Oberon:**
That's why I'm so much more invested in Britain than I probably should be, because they're here.
 
**Oberon:**
It's ridiculous to think that because they're worthless, they can't do anything. Those helpless ones were the only ones to help me.
 
**Oberon:**
So I gotta return the favor☆. That's why I'm working so hard to overthrow Morgan.
 
**Oberon:**
Same as you, Fujimaru.
 
**Oberon:**
I may be powerless and a king of the weak, but I'm not going to half-ass it.
 
**Oberon:**
I'm putting in my full effort. Even if it means I can't save anyone.
 
？1,1020,saveMaterial：So that's why...
 
？2,2020,saveMaterial：That's right, we never heard about when Oberon was summoned.
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, that's how it went down.
 
**Oberon:**
I was summoned to this land several months before you even arrived here.
 
**Oberon:**
It was at the same time that Beryl Gut arrived in this Lostbelt.
 
**Oberon:**
When he intervened here, pan-human history probably noticed the danger.

**Round Table Army Soldier:**
...and that's it for the report from Captain Karwas.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
The enemy has already deployed on the north side, but it's easier to enter from the south.
 
**Percival:**
Understood. As planned, we'll return to Londinium with the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Percival:**
Tell Karwas to hold his position. It's still too early for an all-out battle.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Yessir!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What was that about, Percival?|
 

---

 
**Percival:**
As we expected, the Queen's forces have begun their march on Londinium.
 
**Percival:**
It's the army stationed at Oxford...the Fang Clan, led by Woodwose himself.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That was fast. They shouldn't be able to mobilize so quickly...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's only been a day since Norwich's bell rang. Are they on a forced march because the Queen is demanding some kind of response?
 
**Artoria:**
...Woodwose's forces are made up of nothing but Fang Clan fairies.
 
**Artoria:**
Essentially, they carry no weapons and fight using only their bodies. That's why they can prepare for battle so quickly.
 
**Artoria:**
They have no equal in open battle, but they're not as adept at occupation or holding a siege.
 
**Artoria:**
There's no threat from an army like that assaulting Londinium.
 
**Artoria:**
Why not simply whittle them down during the siege,
 
**Artoria:**
and then kill Woodwose when he loses patience with waiting and takes to the battlefield himself?
 
**Gareth:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
Huh? What is it, Gareth?
 
**Gareth:**
N-nothing...you just...seem different from how you usually are...
 
**Artoria:**
Uh...do I really?
 
**Artoria:**
I'm the same as always...haha...maybe I got a little more confident...?
 
**Oberon:**
Nope. Be as confident as you can be. After all, you rang the pilgrim's bell.
 
**Oberon:**
From here on, more and more anti-Queen forces will gather under the Child of Prophecy from all over.
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria has every right to be proud of herself. In fact, she's gotten stronger somehow, right?
 
**Habetrot:**
That's right~.  Just in terms of magical energy, she's probably equal to one of Morgan's fingers.
 
**Habetrot:**
I had no idea the pilgrim's bell had that kind of power.
 
**Habetrot:**
Must be why the clan heads won't just let you ring them so easily.
 
**Gareth:**
There are five left, right!? Ah, but...
 
**Gareth:**
The Wind Clan's in Salisbury, Wing Clan's in Gloucester, Earth Clan's in Norwich, and Fang Clan's in Oxford...
 
**Gareth:**
That's only four. Where could the bells of the King and Mirror clans be?
 
**Oberon:**
Leave that to me. The Mirror Clan's bell is a big question mark, but I've found out where the fifth bell is.
 
**Oberon:**
It's on the edge of Britain. At the base of the burnt-out husk of the World Tree.
 
**Oberon:**
In a city at the ends of the earth, completely destroyed and now a forbidden zone, the ruined land of Orkney.
 
**Habetrot:**
...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Wait wait, hold on. All this stuff about bells is important, but right now we're talking about Londinium.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Woodwose's army has already deployed, right? Is it really okay to return like this, Percival?
 
**Percival:**
Yes, we're heading back.
 
**Percival:**
Artoria's right, the Fang Clan isn't cut out for siege warfare.
 
**Percival:**
With their current forces, Londinium can probably hold out for ten days if they just defend.
 
**Percival:**
We'll work on countermeasures in the meantime.
 
**Percival:**
Woodwose's army is making camp on the plains about two kilometers north of Londinium.
 
**Percival:**
He can't perform a siege with his forces alone.
 
**Percival:**
If he wants to take the city, he has no choice but to go through the gate and attack the inside of the city itself.
 
**Percival:**
So...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Since it'll be a standoff...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Have a detached force whittle him down?
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Yes. The one thing we have going for us is that we have a base we can fall back to at any time.
 
**Percival:**
We'll continue our retreat to Londinium,
 
**Percival:**
and the forces we sent to liberate Norwich will be divided into two groups, for Londinium's east and west.
 
**Percival:**
If Woodwose launches an all-out assault on Londinium, we'll attack his rear...and keep him in check.
 
**Percival:**
But if we get the chance, we'll attack isolated platoons of his to reduce his strength.
 
**Percival:**
We don't have a chance of winning outright with our current strength, but in a defensive battle, it could go either way.
 
**Percival:**
In the meantime, let's change the state of the war a little bit.
 
**Percival:**
Through the Count, we have Norwich's support now. And resupplying doesn't seem to be an issue.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But even if we go back to Londinium, it's under siege, right?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Is there a secret way into the fortress, or some kind of underground passage? Then it would make sense.
 
**Percival:**
No, that's...there's nothing like that in Londinium...
 
**Percival:**
Or at least we haven't found any...
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Then, what we're going to do from now is...
 
**Oberon:**
Yes, we'll break through Woodwose's lines where they're thinnest!
 
**Oberon:**
This will be great! The perfect debut for the all-new Artoria!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
Tch...! Damn it, we can't stop them...!
 
**Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
It's not just Percival, even the human soldiers are moving with unusual ease...!
 
**Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
Is this the blessing of the Child of Prophecy!? It's just like Her Majesty Morgan...!
 
**Percival:**
We've broken through the enemy platoon! Everyone, push through to Londinium!
 
**Percival:**
As soon as the east gate opens, fall back! I'll be the anchor, and I won't let a single one of them past!
 
**Percival:**
Fujimaru, I'm leaving the Child of Prophecy to you!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm going ahead!
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Good response! I'll see you back in Londinium!
 
**Percival:**
There were a few skirmishes here and there, but our side took almost no casualties.
 
**Percival:**
It seems that victory is ours today. Great work, everybody.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Clocking out for the day~|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Londinium is really sturdy, isn't it?
 
**Gareth:**
Yes. Looking over the construction of the walls, there are Mystic Codes embedded in them.
 
**Gareth:**
They resemble Mash's armor. Armor's amazing! It really is what makes a knight!
 
**Gareth:**
Maybe I should try some on too...or maybe it's still too early for me...
 
**Gareth:**
It's not like I have any clue what I'm doing in the first place...
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
On the other hand, we're still outnumbered. If this drags on, they'll get reinforcements from Camelot.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We can't keep playing defensively. Let's not miss our chance to strike.
 
**Oberon:**
That's for when our own numbers go up. Our supplies from Norwich include personnel.
 
**Oberon:**
Tomorrow, the anti-Queen fairies who helped us in Norwich will join us as volunteer soldiers.
 
**Oberon:**
We'll assault Woodwose's main camp after that. We'll settle it all in one go taking them by surprise.
 
**Percival:**
Yes, that's the plan. Let's rest and recuperate so we're ready.
 
**Percival:**
The men of Londinium will take the night watch, so everyone please get some rest.
 
**Narration:**
~North of Londinium - Woodwose's army camp site~
 
**Woodwose:**
Did I hear you correctly? Say that again, Beryl Gut.
 
**Woodwose:**
I'm forbidden from going into battle...? I'm to refrain from attacking Londinium directly?
 
**Woodwose:**
Like hell Her Majesty would give such an order! I see through your lies, you filthy human!
 
**Woodwose:**
Not only are you brown-nosing the Queen, you aim to taint my strategies as well!?
 
**Beryl:**
Whoa, wait a minute there, boss-man. I'm not so sure about this myself, alright?
 
**Beryl:**
Would be nice to take the castle right away, but it's “a good chance to gather the rebels all in one place.”
 
**Beryl:**
Obviously a bad move, right? I'd like to raise a complaint with her.
 
**Beryl:**
Hey, you know what? Why don't you throw in some critique of the Queen for me?
 
**Beryl:**
I'll take your response back to Camelot.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Oooh yeah, I want to hear that too!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Come on, whine, little puppy! If you've got a problem with Mother, then let her hear!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Weren't you busy being shot down by Aurora in your own restaurant while Norwich was under attack?
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
That would shock anybody. “Don't let Woodwose fight as he is now.”
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Only you can make Mother go that far. Maybe you need a good-luck charm to avoid further trouble, huh?
 
**Woodwose:**
Keep your mouth shut, you brat...!  
 
**Woodwose's Army・Officer:**
Lord Woodwose...! I understand your feelings but please, I beg you...!
 
**Woodwose:**
Phew&mdash;phew...phew...phew...
 
**Woodwose:**
Fine, I get it. I'm not going to end up like Boggart...
 
**Woodwose:**
...Understood. If that is Her Majesty's will, I will follow her orders.
 
**Woodwose:**
We of the Fang Clan are loyal vassals of Her Majesty. We're different from those Earth Clan fools who dance to Spriggan's tune.
 
**Woodwose:**
Fine. I'll play along with their little siege for now.
 
**Woodwose:**
The Child of Prophecy and the Round Table Army. I was entrusted with the task of disposing of both of them.
 
**Woodwose:**
Having Her Majesty's trust is a joyous thing, I should not be upset in the least.
 
**Woodwose:**
But...
 
**Woodwose:**
If they march out, that's a different story.
 
**Woodwose:**
We'll have no choice but to hit them at full force. Do you understand that, Beryl Gut?
 
**Beryl:**
Yeah, of course! I would prefer that myself!
 
**Beryl:**
But I can't lend out Tristan to you, alright? She's my bodyguard, after all.
 
**Beryl:**
If it turns into a serious battle, you guys will be slaughtering the Round Table guys by yourselves.
 
**Beryl:**
You can do that, right? You may be a bit long in the tooth, but you are the head of the Fang Clan after all.
 
**Woodwose:**
...
 
**Woodwose:**
No, this won't require me personally. My elites will be more than enough.
 
**Woodwose:**
The Child of Prophecy and the foreign magus pose no larger a threat than anyone else.
 
**Woodwose:**
The problem is the one who stood up to Lancelot, that cocky Percival...
 
**Woodwose:**
Hmph. Well this is a battle, not a duel. What good is it if he alone survives?
 
**Woodwose:**
If all the humans in his fortress die, he'll give up and surrender.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Well that was a waste of time. Woodwose is completely spineless.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's like he's not willing to fight himself.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Didn't Mother forbid him from fighting himself because he might actually die if he did so?
 
**Beryl:**
Yeah, he's really lost his nerve...
 
**Beryl:**
I haven't seen shivers like that since I was scouted by Marisbury...
 
**Beryl:**
I guess you're that much of a chicken, Woodwose...
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Hey, can we go home? We're done with Mother's errand here.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I know, let's stop at Gloucester on the way!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's so much fun there, perhaps even better than the world you're from!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Let's check out the Count's shop together! Or rob a bank? I'd love to try that!
 
**Beryl:**
Ah...well, maybe next time. I'll think about it when I have some free time.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
But you're not doing anything right now. I'm so booooored.
 
**Beryl:**
Well...there's something bugging me about Morgan's order.
 
**Beryl:**
“Don't let Woodwose fight,” huh...don't you think that sounds backwards?
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Huh? Backwards how?
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;Well, let's hang around a little longer, Lady Spinel.
 
**Beryl:**
If we're lucky, we'll get to see one hell of a show.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Gareth:**
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeew! That was rough!
 
**Gareth:**
Woodwose's soldiers tried to sneak in through the west gate, but we fought them off!
 
**Gareth:**
What the heck was with those Fang Clan? “We're here to deliver food”!?
 
**Gareth:**
The gatekeeper almost let them in!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He didn't mean to, I think he was just dumbfounded.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Every army has a trick or two like that.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
But how did you realize it, Gareth? None of the fairies on the castle walls even caught on.
 
**Gareth:**
Ehehehe...you could say I've got an ear for this sort of thing. I always know where danger lurks, somehow.
 
**Gareth:**
Now that we've prevented the surprise attack, let's get back to the operations room! The relief from Norwich should be here any minute now!
 
**Percival:**
What do you mean, there are no reinforcements from Norwich!?
 
**Percival:**
Nobody who can fight, no smiths, not a single person will join the Round Table Army...!?
 
**Norwich Messenger:**
N-no, I'm just saying they can't right now. The Count is trying to persuade them, but...
 
**Norwich Messenger:**
The fairies of Norwich are grateful to the Child of Prophecy, but this is completely different...
 
**Percival:**
...
 
**Percival:**
...I understand. So that's what they're saying.
 
**Percival:**
They just want to protect Norwich. They don't care about anything else.
 
**Percival:**
Despite the fact that Artoria rang the pilgrim's bell with the determination to save Britain...
 
**Percival:**
Even after she saved them twice over, the fairies of Norwich won't dare fight the Queen's army,
 
**Percival:**
let alone the other clans.
 
**Norwich Messenger:**
I-it's not like that...we're willing to fight.
 
**Norwich Messenger:**
But starting a war you have no chance of winning is...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, that's how it is.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
“If the Child of Prophecy appears, comrades from all over will gather...” It sounds good, but that's just wishful thinking.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Everyone in the Fairy Kingdom has been living under Morgan's thumb for the last 2,000 years.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The terror of it has gotten to them. Plus, there's the Fairy Knights on top of that.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Ringing just one bell isn't going to bring in allies.
 
**Oberon:**
...I'm sure I laid all the groundwork to bring down the Queen when the chance came...
 
**Oberon:**
I guess there really was a limit to what could be done with just gossip...
 
**Gareth:**
...We worked so hard to get this far...yet once we left Norwich, none of it mattered anymore...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
As long as there is no clear chance of victory, the fairies of Norwich cannot join the Round Table Army.
 
**Artoria:**
That's only natural. Please don't worry about it.
 
**Artoria:**
Relay this to the Count.
 
**Artoria:**
We'll manage somehow, so please continue to give us material aid.
 
**Norwich Messenger:**
Y-yes! Now, if you'll please excuse me!
 
**Da Vinci:**
You're not disappointed, Artoria? I thought you'd be taking this the hardest.
 
**Artoria:**
No, I'm actually quite shocked. But bouncing back is my specialty.
 
**Artoria:**
Let's do what we can for now. We'll follow Oberon's example, where he persevered without even the cloak on his back.
 
**Oberon:**
You do know that was a metaphor, right? I wasn't actually streaking.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If one wasn't enough, maybe two will do.|
 
**Artoria:**
Yes. If a second bell rings, perhaps the fairies that chose to wait and see will rise up as well.
 

---

 
**Round Table Army's Messenger Soldier:**
Please excuse me! I have urgent news, milords!
 
**Round Table Army's Messenger Soldier:**
Word from our comrades in Gloucester! I'll read it aloud!
 
**Round Table Army's Messenger Soldier:**
“I've confirmed sight of the Queen's army. They're advancing on the forest of Wales.”
 
**Round Table Army's Messenger Soldier:**
“They carry the standard of Fairy Knight Gawain. This unit is under the Queen's direct orders.”
 
**Round Table Army's Messenger Soldier:**
“We can't stop them. We can't guarantee the safety of the Welsh forest.”
 
**Round Table Army's Messenger Soldier:**
“Please take immediate action.” That's all!
 
**Oberon:**
Sorry. I have to go. I'm leaving the rest to you, Percival.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;You can't, Oberon!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's no point in going by yourself!
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
...You're right. If I head off by myself, I might make it in time, but I wouldn't be able to do anything.
 
**Oberon:**
Would you lend me your strength, Fujimaru, Artoria?
 
**Oberon:**
I'm going to save the fairies in Wales. They never had anything to do with me in the first place.
 
**Oberon:**
I'm the only one who should suffer Morgan's wrath.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not just you, Oberon.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They helped us all as well.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, they sure did. It's been so long, I'd forgotten about that.
 
**Oberon:**
Percival, go talk to the fairy horses. Red Rab-bit won't be enough by himself.
 
**Oberon:**
We'll need four of them, fully harnessed and up to speed. Count me out since I'll be flying.
 
**Oberon:**
The five of us; Fujimaru, Artoria, Muramasa, Gareth, and Da Vinci will all go together.
 
**Percival:**
I'll arrange it immediately.
 
**Percival:**
And there are six of us, not five. I'll be coming along with Kundry.
 
**Habetrot:**
Guess I'm staying behind...well, it can't be helped. I can't fly all that well right now.
 
**Habetrot:**
You need to keep the carriage as light as possible.
 
**Gareth:**
Don't worry, we'll be back soon!
 
**Gareth:**
Don't push yourself too hard while we're gone, Habenyan!
 
**Habetrot:**
Worry more about yourselves. You're going up against a Fairy Knight.
 
**Habetrot:**
A fairy whose true name has been transformed is a tough opponent. Got any sort of plan?
 
**Artoria:**
Of course. If anything, I've been anticipating this moment.
 
**Artoria:**
I won't let Gawain get the best of me again.
 
**Habetrot:**
Heh, what a promising Child of Prophecy. Then there's only one thing left to say.
 
**Habetrot:**
Listen up, whatever it takes, get under her skin once! That's your chance!
 
**Habetrot:**
Uncover the cracks in the armor of her gifted name!
 
**Habetrot:**
In the end, she's just playing the Fairy Knight! All you have to do is get her to deny that!
 
**Artoria:**
Thanks for your straightforward concern and advice! We're off, Habetrot!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see it, it's Wales! But&mdash;the forest is burning...!
 
**Oberon:**
There's still time..! They're probably all hiding themselves!
 
**Oberon:**
Let's split up! Take out the enemies and put out the fires!
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria, Da Vinci, Fujimaru! This way, come on!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We'll take the other side! Percival, Gareth, let's go!
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
By the order of Her Majesty, burn! Burn this vile Forest of Decay to the ground!
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
You scum who named the Fairy King...! Repent for your sins!
 
**Welsh Fairy:**

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(...they're...already...)
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;ah.
 
**Artoria:**
A-ah&mdash;
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
There he is, the Fairy King! Seize him and drag him before Her Majesty!
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
...Hm? Is that the Child of Prophecy next to him?
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
No, but...when I saw her in Camelot, she didn't have such absurd magical energy&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
AAAAAAAAAAAA! You bastards, YOU BASTARDS&mdash;!
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria...!? &mdash;oh crap, she's remembering Tintagel...!
 
**Oberon:**
Fujimaru, go after her!
 
**Oberon:**
She's completely out of control! If she's not careful, she'll get herself killed here!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it, leave it to me!|
 

---

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Artoria:**
Haa...haa...haa....! They're running, they're running away after all this!
 
**Artoria:**
I won't forgive this, I won't forget it...they killed them all&mdash;!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria, calm down...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We should be helping everyone in Wales right now!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Let go, they're getting away! I've got to...I've got to make them pay&mdash;!
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;ah.
 
**Artoria:**
...I'm sorry. I just saw red&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...It's fine. I'm sorry too.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's look for survivors for now.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...Yes. If they escaped up the trees earlier, maybe...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It's useless. We already sweeped the area. All that remains is to burn the forest to the ground.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
You're half a day too late to save them. This is what you get for ringing the bell, Child of Prophecy.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
Fairy Knight Gawain...!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Why did you come here in the first place?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Did you leave Londinium in the middle of a standoff with Woodwose?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
&mdash;I don't understand you at all. Your actions are full of contradictions.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
The weak should follow the strong. If they obey, the strong will eventually entrust them with their corpses.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
If they don't understand that way of things, then they can't be protected.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Child of Prophecy. Foreign magus. If you surrender here, I'll accept.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
My task is to purge Wales. Not to deal with you.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
But&mdash;if you're going to fight, then so be it. My flames will burn you and this forest alike to ash.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(We have to defeat Gawain to protect the forest...!)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(But...if she absorbs my magical energy again...)

---

 
**Artoria:**
It's alright, I'm prepared to fight her! I'll use decoys to counter her eating our magical energy!
 
**Artoria:**
I only have three, so we can only hold out for so long! Let's finish her off quick, Fujimaru!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Wow, we caught a big one here! Not bad, Artoria!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What are you doing here, Muramasa!?|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Hey, I had a bad feeling! I couldn't just leave the girl on her own!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Kuh...! Protecting the magus with such toys...!
 
**Artoria:**
Heh, did you think I'd just sit back and let you whale on us? Snap out of it, you fat, gluttonous knight!
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Y&mdash;how dare you mock me!
 
**Artoria:**
No shit I'd be mocking you! You're a Fairy Knight, you damn moron!
 
**Artoria:**
You do nothing but follow the Queen's orders, you don't even protect the fairies! Calling yourself a Knight of the Round Table is insulting!
 
**Artoria:**
It's true that Sir Gawain was a humorless honor student, and he regarded the word of his king like law.
 
**Artoria:**
But even he wasn't a hound blinded with faith, like you are!
 
**Artoria:**
I know you. I've seen your true name on Ector's manifest.
 
**Artoria:**
Listen well, and remember!
 
**Artoria:**
Your true name is Barghest! The Black Dog Lord, the Thundercloud-Eating Barghest!
 
**Artoria:**
Enough of your “knightly” pretence! Face us without your gifted name!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
Barghest! The black dog fairy from England,
 
**Da Vinci:**
the one who heralds disaster in cities, the fairy with shining horns and eyes of fire!
 
**Barghest:**
...That's right. That's how I should be in pan-human history, isn't it?
 
**Barghest:**
You've shared your accursed knowledge with me. You have my thanks, girl. That helped calm me down.
 
**Barghest:**
But don't think too highly of yourselves, weaklings! Revealing my true name won't change anything!
 
**Barghest:**
Sir Gawain's “Morning Light,” the “Numeral of the Saint” that gives power during the day,
 
**Barghest:**
it is nothing but a hindrance to a creature of the night like myself!
 
**Barghest:**
I may be a fairy-eating beast, I may have lost my Gift, but I am still a knight!
 
**Barghest:**
My horn, dedicated to the Queen, is undimmed! And I will use your lives to prove it!
 
**Artoria:**
Uh...wait a minute...we revealed her true name... shouldn't we win?
 
**Artoria:**
Bageko just got stronger than she was before!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
THIS is where you get cold feet!? You really just get high off the moment, don't you!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
No, I know how she feels! I can't gauge Barghest's magical energy!
 
**Da Vinci:**
What's going on? Now that her true name has been revealed, the additions to her Saint Graph should have vanished, and she should be weakened...
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's as if&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;ugh.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(We can't afford to run away, but)
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
No. We won't retreat. We take down Barghest here.
 
**Oberon:**
Unless one of the Fairy Knights are defeated, there will be no rebellion.
 
**Oberon:**
And&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
It may only have been for a short time, but I am the Lord of Wales, Oberon, King of the Fairies!
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria, Fujimaru, lend me your strength!
 
**Oberon:**
Let us show the Queen's dog who trampled this forest the pride of the weak...!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Percival:**
Setting fire to a forest, slaughtering the defenseless...! So this is how the Queen controls her people!?
 
**Percival:**
You don't deserve to call yourselves knights!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Two soldiers with a single thrust!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So they don't just say you're the “peak of human ability” for nothing, Percival!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Still, this isn't like you. What happened to your usual composure?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You're reasonable despite being so huge. “Big body, and a bigger heart” is your selling point, right?
 
**Percival:**
...That's right. I'm the commander, so I should keep a level head...
 
**Percival:**
Thank you, Master Muramasa. You've brought me back to my senses.
 
**Percival:**
There are no more soldiers here. Gareth and I can wrap this up.
 
**Percival:**
We'll look for survivors. Master Muramasa, please go to Artoria.
 
**Percival:**
You've been worried about her for some time now, haven't you? It's written all over your face.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Is that so?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, sometimes she just lets her feelings get the best of her.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Fujimaru has been through a lot too, but {(M)he/(F)she}'s still just a kid.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You sure it's alright for an old man like me looking after them?
 
**Percival:**
Come now, you don't even look the part. Please take care of them all.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
S-sure. Sometimes you can be that kind of guy too, huh?
 
**Gareth:**
Percival, there's no one here either! No soldiers, or forest fairies!
 
**Percival:**
So it seems. Looks like this is a bust. I found one, but it was too late...
 
**Percival:**
Let's circle around the west and head north to where Artoria and the others went.
 
**Percival:**
There's a possibility there might be people in need of help on the way. I won't have us come this far without saving anyone at all...
 
**Gareth:**
Percival... wha—wait!
 
**Gareth:**
Behind you! The enemy's coming, get out of the way!
 
**Percival:**
Behind...? There's nobody there, I can't sense&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
What is that!? You can see it!? That's amazing, Gareth!
 
**Gareth:**
N-no, what I saw was you in a tough spot...
 
**Gareth:**
I mean, look at that, it's unnatural! It's a mirror! It's reflecting its surroundings!
 
**Gareth:**
Ah, it escaped under that shrub! It's getting away! Get it, Percival!
 
**Percival:**
On it!
 
**Knight Portunes:**
To have my mirror camouflage shattered...this is a black mark on the name of Portunes, the assassin knight.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Well, I've been out of work for 200 years, so I'm quite rusty. It's not a simple blunder.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Still...a fairy who can see through my invisibility...
 
**Knight Portunes:**
I'll take your head, girl. As a precaution.
 
**Percival:**
I won't let you, you coward! Give me a hand, Gareth!
 
**Percival:**
I'm counting on your eyes! Tell me where he is!
 
**Gareth:**
P-please leave it to me! I'll do my best!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Knight Portunes:**
What was I thinking, calling that a precaution!? It's already been decided!
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Argh, what awful luck! How could I come across the one person in the world who can catch me?!
 
**Gareth:**
Percival, he's running off! It looks like he can't turn invisible anymore...
 
**Percival:**
Yeah, he's quite a bothersome fairy. We've got to be sure to take care of him here&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...I do not believe my eyes. What is such a renowned knight doing in this penal colony?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You should be in Londinium, shouldn't you?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No wonder Her Majesty doesn't see your rabble as a threat. You lack the conviction to do what it takes to win.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Seriously&mdash;it's disgraceful how naive you are, Percival.
 
**Percival:**
&mdash;It's you.
 
**Gareth:**
...Lancelot...the strongest Fairy Knight in Britain&mdash;
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We did it...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We defeated a Fairy Knight...!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, how's that!? Now you know the resentment I've held all these years!
 
**Barghest:**
You didn't just win on your own! Oberon, Muramasa, and that foreign magus&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
You won only with Fujimaru's help! Don't act so high and mighty, you brat!
 
**Artoria:**
E-even so!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Barghest.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We may have forced you to your knees, but I can see you still have strength and willpower to spare.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I suppose we could keep beating on each other, but do you really want to keep at this until we all die?
 
**Da Vinci:**
We've managed to exchange words several times by now. But that doesn't mean we understand everything...
 
**Da Vinci:**
You're the type who will listen sincerely to the victor. As such, I'd like to talk to you now.
 
**Barghest:**
...Quite a chatterbox of a Servant, aren't you. Fine. I'll listen.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We, Chaldea, have no intention of attacking Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And that's because&mdash;so long as the Fantasy Tree is destroyed, this Britain will eventually disappear.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I believe that the fate of Britain should rest in the hands of you fairies.
 
**Barghest:**
...Britain will disappear? You're speaking nonsense.
 
**Barghest:**
Your argument is contradictory to begin with.
 
**Barghest:**
So long as you assist the Child of Prophecy, you are all enemies of the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Barghest:**
That's no different from attacking Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...That's where you're wrong, Barghest.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We're working with the Child of Prophecy to save Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Morgan is the aggressor here.
 
**Da Vinci:**
She and Beryl Gut have no intention of saving you fairies.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if all the fairies in the land die out, Morgan will just turn a blind eye to the Great Calamity.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Because she's going to make use of it to invade our own world.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's why she did nothing to help Norwich. You know the truth, don't you?
 
**Da Vinci:**
This may be Morgan's idea of justice,
 
**Da Vinci:**
but her methods cause nothing but suffering for the fairies.
 
**Barghest:**
...I suppose so. I cannot deny this.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then, we can work together from now on...!|
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
Don't even start. You may have a point, but that doesn't mean I approve of you.
 
**Barghest:**
Let your guard down, and I'll kill you without hesitation. Do not forget what I have done here.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
...
 
**Barghest:**
...However, I have a question for you all as well.
 
**Barghest:**
You just said you were here to save Britain, but Beryl Gut says differently.
 
**Barghest:**
He says that Chaldea has destroyed many worlds while claiming they are in the right.
 
**Barghest:**
If that is the case, then you should have come here for the same reason.
 
**Barghest:**
You won't raise your hand against us because we'll destroy ourselves? That's not a reason to “save” us.
 
**Barghest:**
I ask you this, Fujimaru, and your wise and beautiful Servant.
 
**Barghest:**
Putting the Child of Prophecy aside&mdash;why would you, from the outside world, protect us?
 
**Barghest:**
...First Norwich, and now this. You should have just left the fairies be.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's wrong.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...We saved them because we wanted to, I guess...
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even if this world is gone tomorrow,|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know it's a contradiction, but,
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I won't let that be reason enough for today to be ruined.|
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Take it easy. There's no fight left in you, Gaw—no, my bad, it's Barghest now, is it?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
How about we call a truce here? I used to fight these guys too, you know.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's not a bad thing to be honest with yourself if you really want to&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
Ggh...&mdash;! Aah, aagh&mdash;!
 
**Artoria:**
Barghest! Is she turning into a Mors...
 
**Artoria:**
No, that's not it...what is this&mdash;!?
 
**Barghest:**
Haa&mdash;aaa&mdash;name&mdash;name&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
Don't&mdash;call&mdash;my&mdash;name&mdash;!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(What on earth...huh?)|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(That guy...he's targeting Barghest...!)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Barghest, look out...!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Bageko protected Fujimaru!?
 
**Barghest:**
What the hell are you doing!? Do you want to die!? Why are you trying to save me!?
 
**Barghest:**
No, that's not&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
What are you doing, Portunes!? You're attacking me!?
 
**Knight Portunes:**
&mdash;I should be the indignant one, Barghest.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Not only did you listen to their nonsense, but you protected the foreign magus...
 
**Knight Portunes:**
An obvious treason against Her Majesty. If you have proof otherwise, show it now.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Kill the human beside you.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
It should be easy for you. Just reach around and snap {(M)his/(F)her} neck.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
...that's...
 
**Barghest:**
To return the favor&mdash;of fearing for my life&mdash;
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Then, suffer Her Majesty's punishment! May you sleep in terror, you foolish Black Dog!
 
**Artoria:**
Oh shoot, he's getting away...! Is this really alright, Barghest!?
 
**Artoria:**
If he gets back to Camelot, won't you be found guilty of treason!?
 
**Barghest:**
...It doesn't matter. I was true to myself. That's all.
 
**Barghest:**
If Her Majesty is going to pass judgement on me, then as a knight, there is nothing I can do.
 
**Barghest:**
...A traitor who sided with the Child of Prophecy. The sweeping of the Autumn Forest, Oberon's hiding place, is complete.
 
**Barghest:**
My mission is over. I'm withdrawing. As soon as I get back to the castle, I'll probably be dismissed&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
And at the same time, it will show that Fairy Knight Gawain was defeated in battle.
 
**Barghest:**
You've won, Round Table. Celebrate in the streets to your heart's content.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...Barghest is gone, and our fight is over, but...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(...Oberon...)
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
...
 
**Oberon:**
Good. Whatever the outcome, the forest is finally at peace.
 
**Oberon:**
Defeating a Fairy Knight puts a huge feather in our cap.
 
**Oberon:**
I'm glad at least something good came from all this.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oberon...
 
**Oberon:**
But I think I'd like to be alone for now. Sorry, but would you mind heading out to the road ahead of me?
 
**Oberon:**
It's going to take some time to say goodbye to each and every one of them.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Yeah. We'll go and wait in the carriage.
 
**Artoria:**
...Let's go, Fujimaru. If we're here, then...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 

---

 
**Red Rabbit:**
Everyone is safe. I'm relieved.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Oh? I don't see Oberon with you...
 
**Artoria:**
Oberon's going to be late. We'll wait here until dawn.
 
**Artoria:**
Speaking of, where are Percival and Gareth?
 
**Percival:**
We're over here. We had to take a break first.
 
**Percival:**
There were no survivors in the southern or western parts of the forest. I'm deeply sorry for my inability to do anything...
 
**Gareth:**
But you were amazing, Percival! You drove away Lancelot!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Lancelot!? That bastard was here too!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Tch, I screwed up...I should have stayed with Percival...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I've got to pay her back for slamming me into the wall of the Great Pit while I'm still here...
 
**Artoria:**
So there were two Fairy Knights here. And we drove them both off...!
 
**Percival:**
...No. Gareth is exaggerating things. In truth, it was more like she overlooked us...
 
**Percival:**
Once she confirmed the forest fire was out, she flew off towards Camelot.
 
**Percival:**
She's a dragon fairy who soars through the sky. As a human, I have no way of shooting her down...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, we've seen ourselves how maneuverable she is.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Her aerial mobility is unbelievable, on par with our records of Enkidu from Babylonia.
 
**Percival:**
Yes. Because she's the most graceful fairy in the entire kingdom.
 
**Percival:**
But she can't make full use of that mobility in this forest.
 
**Percival:**
I think the reason I was able to hold her off was only because we were fighting in an area with so many obstacles.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The fact of the matter is you managed to stop her. We've only heard she beat up some Alter Ego.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We don't have a lot of information on Lancelot. Combat data would be a big help.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Did you notice anything particular during your fight? Any remarks on the violence?
 
**Gareth:**
Yeah, actually...
 
**Percival:**
No, nothing worth mentioning. I was on the defensive the whole time. I'm sorry.
 
**Percival:**
Isn't that right, Gareth?
 
**Gareth:**
...Well, I guess so. Anyway, it was a great fight.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Still...I'm a little worried about Oberon. He'll probably recover mentally from this, but...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That's a lot of bodies to bury...I should at least help him...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Hm? Bury?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, you know, a burial. What, do you only do cremations here in Britain?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
If you leave a corpse alone, it'll decay. Somehow or other we've got to make graves for them.
 
**Artoria:**
Oh...did you not know, Muramasa? You neither, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Know what?|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Fairies in Britain don't disappear when they die?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Ah! Oh, yeah! Now that you mention it!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I thought something was wrong, but that's it! Even if they die, their Saint Graphs don't dissipate!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yeah. We don't know what fairies in your world are like, but...
 
**Artoria:**
Fairies in this Britain stay around when they die. They don't break down, they don't decay, they just change and remain.
 
**Artoria:**
Human corpses are burned because they rot, but fairy corpses are just left to the land of Britain.
 
**Artoria:**
Look&mdash;you see all those fallen trees? Those are “fairies who lost their life force”.
 
**Artoria:**
This Britain is a land littered with the bodies of dead fairies.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Hmph. To think a knight like myself would be forced to retreat in disgrace. There were too many factors I did not foresee.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
The Child of Prophecy and the foreign magus should have been holed up in Londinium.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Lancelot refusing to obey orders. Gawain doing nothing but burning down the forest.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
No, she's merely Barghest the Black Dog now. I must report her treachery to Her Majesty.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
With all that happened, she should not object to my retreat.
 
**Knight Portunes:**
...But the biggest problem of all is...that girl who saw through my camouflage...
 
**Knight Portunes:**
I would have gotten the truth out of her but... that damn Percival...he had to interfere...
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Well, no matter. I know where they are. As soon as I report to Her Majesty, I'll go to Londinium&mdash;
 
**Knight Portunes:**
&mdash;what?
 
**Knight Portunes:**
Ugh!? What, what's&mdash;my legs, my legs are vanishing...!?

## Fragment / 6 
 
**Narration:**
The year 400 of the Fairy Calendar. The island of Britain in which the Fantasy Tree still stood.
 
**Narration:**
Mash followed Tonelico and Totrot to their camp in the forest to rest.
 
**Narration:**
Puzzled by the similar yet different landscape, she recited them the story of everything that had occured, to the best of her ability.
 
**Mash:**
...in other words, the Fairy Kingdom is the island of Britain that I know.
 
**Mash:**
Was that of any use...?
 
**Totrot:**
Tonelico. Could it be that this guy is one of those pitiful sorts?
 
**Tonelico:**
Totrot, don't say such rude things.
 
**Tonelico:**
There is no lie to her story. What she just told us seems to be a story from the distant future.
 
**Tonelico:**
...Britain, known there as the Fairy Kingdom. ...Morgan, who brought all the clans together.
 
**Tonelico:**
...and the Child of Prophecy, alongside an invader from pan-human history.
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Tonelico:**
Excuse me, invader may have been an exaggeration.
 
**Tonelico:**
I'm still trying to process all of this, so have some patience.
 
**Mash:**
No, it's a given that you would think that, so it's alright...
 
**Mash:**
Tonelico, do you believe me when I say that I'm from Britain in the future?
 
**Tonelico:**
...Yes, I do. I know that what you say is mostly true, but I also feel like I cannot fully believe it.
 
**Tonelico:**
Especially about the “Child of Prophecy,” was it? The fairy who becomes the next Savior, rather than being created for it.
 
**Tonelico:**
Because the simple fact that she exists in the future means...well, it means that I will fail.
 
**Totrot:**
Hogwash! Tonelico will succeed this time!
 
**Totrot:**
You will bring peace to Britain! That prophecy from the Mirror Clan is nonsense!
 
**Tonelico:**
I guess you're right. We have to succeed this time. Would you help me, Totrot?
 
**Totrot:**
You know it! I'm an ally of any girl who does her best!
 
**Totrot:**
You've also had some bad luck, haven't you! So first I'm going to help Tonelico be happy!
 
**Totrot:**
Mash, was it!? I'll help you after that as well, if it's alright with you!
 
**Mash:**
Yes. It would be a pleasure, Habe&mdash;Totrot. I'm counting on you.
 
**Totrot:**
&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
Mash. If you have nowhere else to go, we can protect you but...
 
**Tonelico:**
There's one thing I want you to promise me.
 
**Tonelico:**
If you wish to return to your own time, you must not speak any further of the future whilst you are still here.
 
**Mash:**
Because...by intervening in the past, the future as I know it might be changed... is that it?
 
**Tonelico:**
Hmm...well, that's about right.
 
**Tonelico:**
No matter what you do or say, it will not change the Queen's Calendar, but...
 
**Tonelico:**
Here in this Fairy Calendar where the Fantasy Tree still stands, there will be fairies whose fates could become distorted.
 
**Mash:**
No matter what I do, there will be no change in the Queen's Calendar...? Tonelico, what do you mean...
 
**Tonelico:**
Come on. You're talking about the future again, aren't you?
 
**Mash:**
Ah...y-you're right!! The very mention of the Queen's Calendar is taboo, isn't it!?
 
**Tonelico:**
Exactly. This is a measure to safeguard your fate rather than safeguarding ours.
 
**Tonelico:**
When you return to the time from whence you came, you mustn't have any knowledge that contradicts what you already know.
 
**Tonelico:**
The greater the contradiction, the greater the void in your memory will appear.
 
**Tonelico:**
You don't want to lose those precious memories of yours, do you?
 
**Tonelico:**
In that case, just try not to do anything here that would interfere with the future.
 
**Tonelico:**
But still... Queen Morgan...
 
**Tonelico:**
About her idea of sending the Calamity to the past in order to rid herself of it...
 
**Tonelico:**
If you hadn't cleansed the Calamity of Norwich...
 
**Tonelico:**
Those big hands...was that what you said? Those things would have appeared on the shore.
 
**Tonelico:**
The Knight of Londinium has finally been born, and it almost ruined everything...
 
**Tonelico:**
We can't ever thank you enough for that, Mash.
 
**Tonelico:**
All thanks to you and, what was {(M)his/(F)her} name, Fujimaru?
 
**Tonelico:**
Our fight here will go down much more smoothly.
 
**Mash:**
...Um, your battle...you are referring to the savior's war, right?
 
**Mash:**
Is it the one that took place in the year 4000 of the Fairy Calendar, or is it the Summer War that took place in the year 2000...?
 
**Mash:**
Which period are we even in right now?
 
**Totrot:**
Huh? Wasn't the Summer War in the year 10000?
 
**Totrot:**
The only war that happened in the year 2000 was the Garden Dispute between the Earth and Wind Clans at a time when Britain was still rather small, wasn't it?
 
**Tonelico:**
Ah, you've got it backwards, it seems.
 
**Tonelico:**
From Mash's perspective, the Fairy Calendar years count backwards from the time when it switched over to the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
So, for clarity's sake, let's just refer to everything by how long ago it was from now.
 
**Tonelico:**
The Summer War was 1,600 years ago...or the year 2000 of the Fairy Calendar as Mash would think of it.
 
**Tonelico:**
That was the great invasion from the Shadow Island, Ireland.
 
**Tonelico:**
Led by Queen Mab, who exploited her humans as soldiers, it was the second time the northern fairies waged war in the south.
 
**Tonelico:**
It was really horrible, wasn't it, Totrot?
 
**Totrot:**
Yeah! Everyone from every clan were all on the verge of dying!
 
**Totrot:**
What would they have done without Tonelico and the Black Knight! Right, Black Knight!?
 
**Black Knight:**
...That's right. Queen Mab was a very powerful fairy.
 
**Black Knight:**
It wasn't just that she had the Blessing of Albion. She possessed a primordial strength that the southern fairies did not.
 
**Black Knight:**
If Tonelico had not stepped in and stalled for time, all the clans would have been wiped out then and there.
 
**Black Knight:**
But in the end...even though Mab was just one step away from winning, she suggested a peace treaty.
 
**Black Knight:**
And, as a result of that, Mab took up the vacant position left from the Rain Clan, and became a great lord up north in Orkney.
 
**Mash:**
O-oh, I see. Thank you for the explanation.
 
**Mash:**
...By the way, who is this person?
 
**Tonelico:**
This is my bodyguard, Master Black Knight. We've been working together for a long time, haven't we?
 
**Black Knight:**
Yeah, ever since you showed yourself on the stage.
 
**Black Knight:**
I've been fighting by your side for over 2,000 years now. It's getting difficult to keep this up, even as our bodies cheat death.
 
**Black Knight:**
Whether you're able to save Britain this time or not, please just give it up after this time.
 
**Tonelico:**
Don't worry, it'll work out just fine this time around! All that is left is the coronation!
 
**Black Knight:**
...Well, I guess you're right. If you can't succeed after that, then nothing else will work.
 
**Black Knight:**
The war between the clans has finally ended after 10,000 years. A new king has been born in Britain.
 
**Black Knight:**
But...to think that the person who would unite the five clans is not a fairy, but a human...
 
**Black Knight:**
It couldn't have been foreseen. Then again, fairies can't even put up with other fairies.
 
**Mash:**
Hold on, what were you just saying...? Britain's king...? A human?
 
**Totrot:**
Yup, exactly! Mab is still complaining about it! Saying stuff like “I'm more fit to be King of Britain than any human!”
 
**Tonelico:**
Mab has her own pride after all, Totrot, especially after what happened in the Summer War.
 
**Tonelico:**
Ah, sorry. Let us get back on track. Right now, it would be year 400 of the Fairy Calendar from Mash's point of view.
 
**Tonelico:**
So, 400 years from now Queen Morgan will make her entrance...
 
**Tonelico:**
Hmm...it's something that I must not think about, but I can't help myself...
 
**Tonelico:**
It's true that since Uther is a human, he will not live for more than another 10 years.
 
**Tonelico:**
After that, there will be several generations of his heirs, and then 400 years later Morgan will be queen...?
 
**Tonelico:**
How would that work...?
 
**Mash:**
Even you don't know, do you, Tonelico...
 
**Mash:**
But I think it's a sure thing that the conflicts between the clans will cease.
 
**Mash:**
After all, in the Fairy Kingdom I know of, there are very few conflicts between them...ah—
 
**Mash:**
Sorry, I talked about the future again...
 
**Tonelico:**
If it's just that, which is within the margin of error, it's fine. Either way, the future will be a peaceful one, it seems?
 
**Tonelico:**
Britain has always been a land filled with warfare as the clans fought for their territory...
 
**Tonelico:**
If that all ends with our generation, I couldn't be any happier.
 
**Totrot:**
It's all because we were able to put a dent in the Earth, Wind, Fang, and Mirror clans with the help of Muryan of the Wing Clan and Uther's allied forces.
 
**Totrot:**
Mab and her King Clan were the only ones who we ended in a draw against.
 
**Totrot:**
Wasn't Mab gonna try for a marriage of convenience? Imagine that! If Mab and Uther joined forces, they would be unstoppable!
 
**Totrot:**
...Well, Uther fancies Tonelico, so Mab may become rather pitiful.
 
**Tonelico:**
That's not at all how it is. Uther will receive his crown,
 
**Tonelico:**
and I will return to Paradise as soon as I ascertain that I have received the Bone Bells from the clans.
 
**Tonelico:**
I think Uther and Mab would look great together! I bet the next 400 years will be a time of peace!
 
**Black Knight:**
That is all for after the coronation in Londinium.
 
**Black Knight:**
Tonelico. Why won't you just use the cathedral in Salisbury? That place has more history, doesn't it?
 
**Black Knight:**
Londinium may be an impenetrable stronghold, but it still has the stench of blood. Mors do show up every once in a while.
 
**Black Knight:**
For safety's sake, I think Salisbury would be the better choice.
 
**Tonelico:**
That's because...Salisbury is closer to the Great Pit. I'm just being wary of that.
 
**Tonelico:**
No one in Britain knows what is at the bottom of the Great Pit.
 
**Tonelico:**
No, actually, no one in Britain dares to find out what is at the bottom of the Great Pit, because their consciousness won't let them.
 
**Tonelico:**
I'm the only one who dares to look inside, but the bottom is too deep for me to investigate alone...
 
**Tonelico:**
If there's another person or fairy who could use magecraft, or had the strength and courage...
 
**Tonelico:**
If there were such a person who was not from Britain, who would be willing to collaborate with me, I could investigate&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
Investigate&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
W-what is it, Tonelico?
 
**Tonelico:**
I goooot it!!! Yaaaay!!!
 
**Tonelico:**
Everyone, change of plans, let's go to the Great Pit! Right now!
 
**Tonelico:**
Mash and I will solve the biggest mystery in all of Britain!
 
## Section 14: The Night Before the Final Battle (I) 
 
**Narration:**
A bell rings out in the distance.
 
**Narration:**
All through sixteen years, I'd heard the Pilgrim's Bell ring in Tintagel.
 
**Narration:**
It was crude, nothing like the real things, fashioned to sound out the Child of Prophecy's coming of age and departure.
 
**Narration:**
The fairy hamlet of Tintagel was located on the coast, north of Cornwall.
 
**Narration:**
It was little more than a footnote like that to Her Majesty and the clan heads.
 
**Mother:**
Caster, I got you a new book today.
 
**Mother:**
A book on etiquette among the noble fairies. You'll be leaving for the castle at some point, after all.
 
**Mother:**
Let's start studying it right now. Hmm, is this table alright?
 
**Mother:**
&mdash;Incidentally, has your Fairy Pattern matured yet? You'll turn 16 in two years, you know?
 
**Mother:**
For now...I'm just a little worried about you. You have a very trying journey ahead.
 
**Village Leader:**
Caster, you did a splendid job today. You're truly a diligent, sincere, and efficient girl.
 
**Village Leader:**
You always manage to find what the village lacks, never losing yourself in games.
 
**Village Leader:**
I wish the other fairies would follow your example. Looking after you has been a big help for us.
 
**Village Leader:**
And yet...this year's tax collection will be rough.
 
**Village Leader:**
Thanks to you, the village still has a surplus, but...
 
**Village Leader:**
At this rate, Tintagel may be ruined before you even get to turn 16.
 
**Village Leader:**
Oh, I worry so, so much...why must you be so&mdash;
 
**Friend:**
None of them have even the slightest shred of subtlety. Better not to live to old age if it means being so frail.
 
**Friend:**
Don't you agree, Caster? You gotta distance yourself from the stuff you don't like.
 
**Friend:**
Or is being treated all special as the Child of Prophecy what you want?
 
**Friend:**
Come play with us. The headman won't care if it's just for a while.
 
**Friend:**
They say merchants are coming in by the east road. Maybe we can get some instruments made in Gloucester!
 
**Friend:**
I bet they'll be convinced to sell one if the great Child of Prophecy asked!
 
**Friend:**
By the way, have you been growing?
 
**Friend:**
The old folks said you're different from us. That you're a fairy who grows up.
 
**Friend:**
That's a gross thing to imagine, but probably for the best.
 
**Friend:**
With such measly magical energy capacity, a single Black Dog would probably kill you.
 
**Friend:**
So you need to grow up quickly and protect us. 'Til then, we'll protect you!
 
**Narration:**
Every last one of them had such high hopes for me.
 
**Narration:**
In such a small village, where even the next day was an uncertainty, they put their trust in me.
 
**Narration:**
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
 
**Narration:**
I'm sorry for being weak, for not being strong.
 
**Narration:**
The village&mdash; I'm sorry I couldn't protect Tintagel.
 
**Woodwose:**
Damn, what's possessed this village!?
 
**Woodwose:**
They resisted when they knew it was plainly futile! Have they all gone mad?
 
**Woodwose:**
Forget the fairies of Tintagel! Find the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Woodwose:**
We'll never live it down if she escapes now! I'll never be able to face Her Majesty Morgan!
 
**Narration:**
A voice bellowed like thunder. I had never heard a “powerful fairy” roar in anger.
 
**Narration:**
I was too scared to even put up a fight, so I fled the village alone and in tears.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;But I really did want to stay in the village too, old man.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
We made it to Salisbury in half a day's time. This new carriage has a rather comfortable pull to it.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Now that the war with Her Majesty has commenced, I've no intention of obeying the speed limits.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
We should be able to make Londinium by sunset. What do you think?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're...fast, all right...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think we need a little break...
 

---

 
**Gareth:**
Agreed...my butt and back feel like they're in pieces.
 
**Oberon:**
I may need a breather myself. I think I may have a touch of motion sickness.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Then let's take a break at Mike's place. There's something we should discuss.
 
**Da Vinci:**
What about you, Percival?
 
**Percival:**
I'll press on from here to Londinium.
 
**Percival:**
The Child of Prophecy is welcome here, but not so much the commander of the Round Table Army.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...? That's an odd conclusion, Percival.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Aren't there rebels in Salisbury? Why can't you just cooperate?
 
**Artoria:**
No. The Round Table Army and Salisbury rebels are two different groups.
 
**Artoria:**
You could call it a difference in discipline...
 
**Artoria:**
For starters, Aurora is maintaining her status as leader of a clan allied with the Queen.
 
**Artoria:**
Any sign of collaborating with the Round Table Army would lead to them being crushed first.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Sure, I suppose...but it doesn't feel right to keep quiet at this point, does it?
 
**Percival:**
It's the right choice, Master Muramasa. One becoming of Lady Aurora.
 
**Percival:**
Kundry says we can make the distance too. You'll be returning to Londinium on our heels.
 
**Poem Sang Outside:**
O lovely Child of Prophecy ♪ O hopeful Child of Prophecy ♪
 
**Poem Sang Outside:**
Courageous savior Norwich went ♪ The Queen in Camelot shall bend ♪
 
**Poem Sang Outside:**
Londinium to retake and Fairy Knights to all unmake ♪
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gosh...a real festival's broken out outside...|
 
**Gareth:**
Yes, an Artoria festival! They were selling hard-baked cakes and sweets too!
 
**Gareth:**
I'll buy a dozen or so later!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Suddenly you're a star, Artoria!
 
**Artoria:**
Some star I am...they shouldn't make confections shaped like people's faces...
 
**Artoria:**
This one even looks prettier than me. Well, the Wind Clan are insults personified!
 

---

 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
It's Dabinchi! Dabinchi's back!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Who goes away for “a while” and shows up two weeks later, for crying out loud?
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Never mind, it's over and done with. Have I got new goodies to show you, Dabinchi!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
I made a brand new menu, and made friends with the Wind Clan...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
I'm even attending human gatherings! It's a handful, but each day's been fun.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Good to be back, Mike. Sorry to have worried you.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But aren't you spreading yourself too thin with all the new stuff?
 
**Da Vinci:**
You're the type who homes in on impulse. Don't you think focusing on one thing at a time works better?
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Hey, you might be right. But that alone couldn't do it for me!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Not a bit of it compares to what I learned from you, Dabinchi!
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Man, I can't rebuke you after you put it like that.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Sorry, Fujimaru, I'll be in the kitchen.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's going to be some wacky flavors if I don't evaluate Mike's revamped fare.
 
**Oberon:**
Sounds good, take your time. We'll just be sitting in the back.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Da Vinci must have made good friends here. Though that one's more like a disciple.
 
**Oberon:**
I hear tell he's a fairy that Da Vinci met while wandering about.
 
**Oberon:**
Thanks to that relationship, we have free rein to use this shop,
 
**Oberon:**
to the extent of holding secret meetings such as this in the back.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Oberon?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Right, here's where we get serious.
 
**Oberon:**
Between here and the Welsh forest, you've all kept quiet out of consideration for me, right?
 
**Oberon:**
It's very thoughtful of you, but we can't afford that luxury anymore.
 
**Oberon:**
In order to rout the army of Woodwose laying siege to Londinium, I'll be wanting one thing&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You'll want what?
 
**Oberon:**
A katana. Won't you make me a katana, Muramasa?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Ha?
 
**Oberon:**
I have reservations about fighting with a tree branch. I'm a boy at heart, you see.
 
**Oberon:**
And wouldn't it be way cooler to have a katana of yours, Muramasa? I'd like to wear one in my belt, if you'd let me.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I can't see anyone wearing a blade for looks alone. Not to mention, you can't handle iron in the first place, can you?
 
**Oberon:**
Don't worry, it's all for appearances! I'd never use something so dangerous!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That's even worse, you doof! Hold your damn fashion-samurai horses and I'll make you a bamboo sword.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Honestly, Oberon...|
 

---

 
**Gareth:**
(Hee-hee. It's nice to see Oberon back in good spirits, Fujimaru.)
 
**Artoria:**
(Yes, it may sound like a joke, but Oberon seems quite serious about wanting a sword.)
 
**Oberon:**
Goodness, you're stingier than I thought. Back in the woods, you couldn't have won against Barghest without my help.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That is another concern entirely. You don't give a sword to someone who doesn't even know how to cut.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I should say you were able to handle yourself fine. Or was your fight all flash and no form?
 
**Oberon:**
Be that as it may...well, I tell no lies here.
 
**Oberon:**
I don't like pain, so I'm a support-type Servant.
 
**Oberon:**
I didn't want to stand out with the Child of Prophecy nearby.
 
**Oberon:**
If one of her companions showed her up, Artoria may have just returned to Tintagel in a huff.
 
**Oberon:**
I was ready to fade into the background until she built more confidence.
 
**Artoria:**
T-true, I may have gone back to Tintagel.
 
**Oberon:**
As I said.
 
**Oberon:**
Although, that's all I have left to fight for...after losing my mind in the forest.
 
**Oberon:**
The Child of Prophecy will be guided by the foreign magus, and not me.
 
**Oberon:**
There are no more airs to put on. From here on out, I fight for all of you.
 
**Oberon:**
After the Welsh forest went up in flames, my turn in the spotlight may well be coming to an end.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon...?|

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
You guys! Mike just passed on some fresh intelligence!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Huh, how'd things get all serious here? Did you already hear from the bar customers?
 
**Oberon:**
Oh, nothing. I'm interested. Do tell, Da Vinci.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right, there was a refugee who fled here from Norwich.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The fairies there headed for Londinium this morning to join the Round Table Army.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Could it be because...we beat Gawain?|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Somehow, news about Fairy Knight Gawain's defeat has spread all over Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I might know one fairy who can propagate gossip as fast as this, but I'll leave that aside.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The key thing is that the hopes for the Child of Prophecy have come to life.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The enemy thinks the Round Table Army will stay besieged, but if we can just slap together enough of a force&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
We can crush Woodwose before Her Majesty's reinforcements arrive!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right. Provided we can remobilize from all corners of the land.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's the only way to pull this off. Can we rely on you, Oberon?
 
**Oberon:**
But of course. You guys already make the grade to begin with.
 
**Oberon:**
Now then, it's Aurora's turn to keep her word.
 
**Oberon:**
Let's puff our chests and go claim our reward for saving Norwich!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aurora willingly gave us access to the bell!|
 

---

 
**Red Rabbit:**
Yes. I was outside the city composing a verse and I could hear it quite well.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
But I am worried. Aurora's position may be in jeopardy now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
She insists on telling the Queen that “somebody broke in and rang the bell” while she was away.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's a rather transparent lie, but let's trust Aurora's skill at negotiation for that.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if the Queen ends up seeing her as an enemy, if she can stall long enough for us to defeat Woodwose's army,
 
**Da Vinci:**
we can advance the Round Table Army to Salisbury. Then we can protect her if the Queen marches her army.
 
**Gareth:**
Right! And what's more, the second bell has been rung!
 
**Gareth:**
Even I can tell that Artoria's “pressure” is amazing!
 
**Gareth:**
Power, strength, destructive force! She's powered up in every way!
 
**Gareth:**
“I declare that I am the strongest. As I am now, not even Barghest can stand against me!”
 
**Gareth:**
Or something like that! Gareth is impressed!
 
**Artoria:**
Uh, you think so? I don't remember ever saying anything like that, did I?
 
**Artoria:**
What about you two, Oberon, Fujimaru? Do you think I could take on Bageko alone?
 
**Oberon:**
Isn't that normally impossible?
 
**Oberon:**
If it was Tristan, you could just about scrape by, but Barghest is a strong opponent even without her gifted name.
 
**Oberon:**
She was more than ten times stronger than you to begin with. Wouldn't taking her on alone be suicide?
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, no kidding...and I was pretty weak originally anyway...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's true you've gotten stronger.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Artoria's magic circuits...well, her Fairy Pattern, since she's a fairy.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's clear they're increasing.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Both fairies and humans are generally born with these nerves.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's not a case of “training them to become stronger,”  but more “increasing the number of circuits themselves.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's unprecedented. This is definitely a sign that you're something special.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But that makes me wonder. There are two kinds of fairies in the Fairy Kingdom,
 
**Da Vinci:**
“The ones that don't change from birth,” and “the ones that change every step of the way.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
Or so I've heard. I think you're the latter, but...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Still, there aren't many examples of fairies whose abilities change as drastically as yours.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But there are those who lose magical energy due to losing their “purpose” or “shine” though.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I wonder if you've experienced that yourself.
 
**Artoria:**
Hmm...I'd like to know myself, but...
 
**Artoria:**
Well, maybe it's because I'm the Child of Prophecy! Without that kind of bonus, I wouldn't be doing this!
 
**Oberon:**
Hahaha. I see, you have a point.
 
**Oberon:**
The mediocre Artoria has to defeat the genius Morgan. The game was rigged from the start!
 
**Artoria:**
Urgh. Well then, where does your ability rank, Oberon?
 
**Artoria:**
I didn't get a good chance to see in the forest, so show me one more time.
 
**Oberon:**
Didn't I already tell you that I'm not a fighter? Also, I don't have anyone to&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
You do. Muramasa is here. Gareth is here. Red Rab-bit is also here.
 
**Artoria:**
Da Vinci is here too. And of course Fujimaru is here.
 
**Artoria:**
Right, we're all divided into teams. Let's begin, Oberon.
 
**Oberon:**
Well, all right then! You with me, Fujimaru!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You know it.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sorry, man.
 

---

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Aurora:**
The bell of Salisbury has rung. I cannot declare it yet, but...
 
**Aurora:**
As the leader of the Wind Clan, I acknowledge the legitimacy of the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Aurora:**
When she rings all the bells, the Wind Clan shall rise up against the Queen's rule.
 
**Aurora:**
The war will reach Salisbury eventually.
 
**Aurora:**
I'm very sorry to ask this of you, but will you agree to this...?
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
We have no objections!
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
We can't trust Queen Morgan with the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
Every one of us has been waiting with baited breath for your decision, Lady Aurora!
 
**Aurora:**
...
 
**Coral:**
Just what you'd expect from the guards of Salisbury. Your loyalty is most gratifying.
 
**Coral:**
The Child of Prophecy has returned to Londinium. She will soon engage in battle with Woodwose.
 
**Coral:**
When the bell of Oxford is rung, things will change dramatically in the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Coral:**
Continue to prepare your forces in case of emergency.
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
Huh? Please wait, Lady Coral.
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
We've already organized our forces. We can depart for Londinium at any time.
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
Should we not also cross swords with Woodwose to show the power of Salisbury?
 
**Coral:**
&mdash;Watch your tongue. That is not for you to decide.
 
**Coral:**
The Fang Clan is an honorable clan that has long defended Britain. Do you understand?
 
**Coral:**
The Wind Clan shall not wage war on the Fang Clan.
 
**Coral:**
The ones we should fight are the witch Morgan, the Earth Clan who broke the ban, and the Queen's backers in Camelot revelling in their peaceful lives.
 
**Coral:**
And finally, the anti-fairy band of humans who do not think about their actions.
 
**Coral:**
Lady Aurora will only stand as leader when the siege of Camelot becomes a reality.
 
**Coral:**
I will not allow you to jeopardize our city's safety unnecessarily.
 
**Coral:**
Until then, Salisbury will remain neutral. Ignore the humans of Londinium.
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
That's...
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
So should the Child of Prophecy be defeated, Salisbury will remain blameless...?
 
**Coral:**
So you do understand. I trust there are no objections?
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
...Understood.
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
Should the residents of Londinium evacuate, our gates will remain closed.
 
**Aurora:**
Is that so? I believe that is enough, Coral.
 
**Coral:**
Lady Aurora!?
 
**Aurora:**
Certainly, it would be difficult to take in a defeated Round Table Army.
 
**Aurora:**
But if they did not participate in the fighting, they would be nothing more than refugees.
 
**Aurora:**
As clan head, I cannot abandon those who have no place to go.
 
**Aurora:**
And...
 
**Aurora:**
If we abandon the weak, then do we have any right to rise up against Her Majesty?
 
**Coral:**
But then we will have to battle the Queen before the Child of Prophecy can complete her pilgrimage&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
It will be all right. There won't be a problem, Coral.
 
**Aurora:**
You've seen Artoria, haven't you? She can protect Londinium now.
 
**Aurora:**
And Oberon and Fujimaru are with her.
 
**Aurora:**
...But, even so, should the Round Table Army be defeated&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
When that happens, we too must stop observing and rise up.
 
**Aurora:**
For the fairies and humans seeking refuge from Londinium. To protect their lives and their freedom.
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
Ooh...Lady Aurora...! Your generosity knows no bounds...!
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
Reaching out to them despite how they refused our aid and stubbornly insisted on their own independence!
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
Truly, Lady Aurora is the ideal queen...the one who can bridge the gap between humans and fairies!
 
**Aurora's Guards:**
We of the Liberation Army dedicate our lives to the protection of our lady and her city!
 
**Coral:**
...(What are you saying, you lesser beings...)
 
**Coral:**
(You can't protect Salisbury or Lady Aurora...)
 
**Coral:**
(...No. We can't rely on humans. We have to place all our trust in the Child of Prophecy...)
 
**Coral:**
(...The Pilgrim's Bells...please, ring them all before we go to war with the Queen...)
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We managed to make it back before sundown, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's only been two days...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, but there are noticeably more people here, aren't there?!
 
**Habetrot:**
I know, right? From the east gate to the south, it's been bustling ever since this morning!
 
**Habetrot:**
This is all because you took down a Fairy Knight. Even I was surprised by the news.
 
**Percival:**
Welcome back, everyone.
 
**Percival:**
I wasn't worried, but I'm still glad there wasn't anything serious.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're back, Habetrot, Percival.|
 
**Habetrot:**
Yep, welcome back. I like that you're greeting people properly.
 
**Artoria:**
Percival, are all these new fairies and humans here for...?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Does this crowd mean...?
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Yes. They're new recruits from Norwich, and people wanting refuge in Londinium.
 
**Percival:**
Even so, we only took in about half, and the rest we had to send back to Norwich.
 
**Count Peperon:**
That's right. They took advantage of the night to sneak in under the cover of darkness, but as you might expect, we can only take in so many, you know?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Woodwose has started sending out patrol units, so the rest will come after the battle, won't they?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Pepe! You came too?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Oh, yes. It really feels like it's time for the decisive battle, don't you think?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Sitting in Norwich, listening to reports alone would feel like such a waste, so I decided to pop on over♡
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Glad you could make it, Pepe.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks for everything, Count.
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
It's nothing. If you want to thank me, you can do that a little later.
 
**Count Peperon:**
You see, I have my own agenda too. You could say that I'm using you all as bait.
 
**Count Peperon:**
If the defensive battle commences here, you'll be sticking around, won't you, Fujimaru?
 
**Count Peperon:**
In a situation where his target is “clearly located”, Beryl will always make the effort to show up in person.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I wonder why that's the case. I'll know where to aim, at least.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Unwinding after a tough battle is something I always look forward to.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So then, we're all in the same boat. Well, if it's one less thing to worry about, then I'm all for it.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Don't get too reckless now. If you die here, we'll have to fix up Norwich all over again.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Oh my, are you worried about little ol' me? That makes this whole trip worth it!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You're worse than Spriggan, you moron. My duty is to bodyguard the Child of Prophecy right now, remember?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Yes, let's run with that then.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Then, as someone who once knew a thing or two about “Chaldea”, let me share something with you.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Percival, Artoria, Fujimaru, Da Vinci.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Can you come to the operations room? I have a proposal for you concerning what comes “after the prophecy.”
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
After the prophecy...?|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
I'll get straight to the point.
 
**Count Peperon:**
This Lostbelt is different from the others. It won't disappear even if the Fantasy Tree has been completely removed.
 
**Count Peperon:**
This land has moved far past simply being “a divergence from pan-human history”.
 
**Count Peperon:**
A world with the same “strength” as pan-human history...a new human history, no longer a fantasy.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Isn't it ironic that a world of daydreaming fairies would become “human history”?
 
**Da Vinci:**
...even I can't call this a Lostbelt anymore, it's more of a Lostworld at this point.
 
**Da Vinci:**
During the attack on Olympus, Britain's Fantasy Tree was torched and burned down.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But that's not when it ceased functioning.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That was much earlier. Most probably, when Morgan took control of Britain, in the first year of the Queen's Calendar&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
This Lostbelt broke off from fantasy long before the year 2017.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's probably safe to assume that it's not the Fantasy Tree that sustains this Lostbelt, but Morgan's actions.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...But, how so? If Morgan is defeated, then the Lostbelt will return to normal.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I don't think there will be any change from the gradual “pruning” we've seen up until now.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Yes, for Britain itself. The inhabitants are a different matter, though.
 
**Count Peperon:**
In the other Lostbelts, the fate of its residents was a given.
 
**Count Peperon:**
But here, it's different.
 
**Count Peperon:**
At the very least, fairies born after the change to the Queen's Calendar won't disappear if they exit the Lostbelt.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Because their existence is of the same “strength” as someone from pan-human history. That's the discrepancy I'm talking about.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't mean&mdash;emigration?|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
Yes. A human ma&ndash; ...born in in this land can only live here&mdash;
 
**Count Peperon:**
But if you're a fairy of this land, then it's possible to move over to pan-human history.
 
**Count Peperon:**
It means there's a possible future together.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;!|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
So, uh...
 
**Artoria:**
What is he talking about, Da Vinci?
 
**Da Vinci:**
He means that after we defeat Morgan, even if this Lostbelt were to disappear,
 
**Da Vinci:**
you can save yourselves by fleeing to the outside world.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's still the problem of getting past that Wall of Light though.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Yes. To disappear along with the Fairy Kingdom, or to attempt a new life in pan-human history&mdash;
 
**Count Peperon:**
You're free to make that decision, Artoria. No, more than that&mdash;
 
**Count Peperon:**
You could stop being the Child of Prophecy and just run away if you wanted.
 
**Count Peperon:**
With Chaldea's Storm Border, you could start a whole new life.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...You sure say some wild stuff, Pepe. And in front of Percival, of all people.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I can say this because he's here.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Percy-boy already knows about pan-human history, Lostbelts, Chaldea, and the Fantasy Tree.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I've also told him about you, Fujimaru, and Artoria.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I'm just trying to be fair and clean up all the loose ends by myself, in my own way, you know?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Percival...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now that you mention it, how...
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Yeah...I don't know as much as the rest of you, so I can only make childish assumptions...
 
**Percival:**
If Artoria wants to deny her status as Child of Prophecy, it would be a shame, but I think that's fine.
 
**Artoria:**
You're alright with it!? Even after creating the Round Table Army!?
 
**Percival:**
Yes. The Round Table Army was something I built because I wanted to.
 
**Percival:**
It's not forced on anyone, nor does it control anyone.
 
**Percival:**
...Besides, I'm not cut out to be called anything like “commander”.
 
**Percival:**
So you don't need to decide your path based on us, Artoria.
 
**Percival:**
Even if we don't defeat the Queen, there's a way for the fairies to escape to the outside world&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
Isn't just knowing that a huge step forward for the Fairy Kingdom?
 
**Artoria:**
Y-yeah, I guess so...but still...
 
**Artoria:**
...I don't think it's that simple. Morgan will never leave you be.
 
**Artoria:**
If the fairies of Britain are to be saved, Morgan le Fay must be defeated.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see...|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
le Fay?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I think it was used to mean “fairy” in Arthurian lore.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's the same thing as “fae” in modern parlance. But...
 
**Da Vinci:**
(There were no fairies here who ever called Morgan that...)
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
So, Artoria wants to follow the prophecy and defeat Queen Morgan.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Maybe then, I'll stick around until the end.
 
**Count Peperon:**
If Beryl's the Crypter here,
 
**Count Peperon:**
then just think of me as Fujimaru's meddlesome senpai.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Right, that's enough serious talk for now. Oh, and I probably shouldn't have to mention it, but...
 
**Count Peperon:**
If Artoria is sticking to the prophecy, than all of this was off the record.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Saying “we might be able to escape to the outside world” would be a little demoralizing for our rebels, you know?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Percival:**
Well then, on to present matters.
 
**Percival:**
The volunteers from Norwich have increased our strength, but they cannot be fielded quite yet.
 
**Percival:**
They may have training to act as soldiers, but it takes time to build communication and cooperation among troops.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's for sure. It's reckless to move a unit of over a hundred without some practical training.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So that's a no to ambushing Woodwose's main force? We'll stay on the defensive and strengthen our skills that way?
 
**Percival:**
That's the safer option, but we lack the time for it as well.
 
**Percival:**
Any reinforcements to Woodwose from the Queen stand to frustrate Londinium's defence.
 
**Percival:**
As such, we're going to use hand-picked crack troops from my company to show our commitment there.
 
**Percival:**
Both Etwar and Kenwood's platoons will take a day to discreetly circle behind the enemy lines.
 
**Percival:**
Once ready, we will march a company out of Londinium bolstered by the Norwich volunteers.
 
**Percival:**
With the confirmation that Woodwose's force has been lured to Londinium,
 
**Percival:**
our main force will strike hard at Woodwose himself from the enemy's rear.
 
**Percival:**
The fall of a clan head will rob its fairies of their sense of purpose. Such a thing will be their downfall.
 
**Percival:**
Begging your pardon, but I have to make use of the advantage present this time.
 
**Artoria:**
So...the decisive battle is tomorrow night?
 
**Percival:**
Yes, today will be the eve of the decisive battle.
 
**Percival:**
Our assault force is scheduled to depart Londinium before sunrise.
 
**Percival:**
I would ask all of you to remain in Londinium to defend the walls should the worst come to pass...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then, you're heading out with them?
 
**Percival:**
Your help would be appreciated, but the march will be through the river's upper reaches.
 
**Percival:**
If you're not used to it, you'll likely be completely exhausted on arrival.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Okay, loud and clear. We'll be put to best use in the sortie.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Battles on the flatland are your domain, Percival.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We'll handle things here, so put all your focus into claiming victory.
 
**Percival:**
&mdash;Yes, thank you, Lady Da Vinci.
 
**Percival:**
Leave it to me. I swear, by my holy spear, that I shall eliminate Woodwose.
 
**Habetrot:**
Hm-hm-hmm ♪ Nyah! Hm-hm-hmm ♪ Nwah!
 
**Habetrot:**
Bwa-bwah! Look, it's Oberon!
 
**Habetrot:**
“Surprised? Even a smiling blockhead prince like me shows anger when his dominion burns down!”
 
**Habetrot:**
But it's a little underhanded! One trap in the woods and Barghest's shanks turn to shreds!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Habetrot?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
On a desk, legs swinging, quill in hand...
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
Hmm? Oh, it's Fujimaru.
 
**Habetrot:**
This is a diary. I'm super forgetful, so this is a fun way to keep my days on record.
 
**Habetrot:**
It's you who sought out an empty operations room.
 
**Habetrot:**
I take it you ran here out of guilt over the upheaval in the square?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You could tell?
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
I could. You're worried about Mash.
 
**Habetrot:**
You can stow it away during a fight, but you're sure to dwell on that in this kind of situation.
 
**Habetrot:**
I've told you enough times that you and she will be together again. You have my guarantee.
 
**Habetrot:**
I couldn't tell you where Mash is or how she's doing.
 
**Habetrot:**
But you have trustworthy friends, as well as Heroic Spirits of pan-human history searching for her.
 
**Habetrot:**
All you need to do is help Artoria. That's your shortcut back to Mash.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Isn't Mash being held captive by Morgan...?|
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
...No one is eavesdropping, right? This might suffice...
 
**Habetrot:**
Yeah, Morgan probably was the one who spirited Mash away. Beyond that, it becomes a matter that Morgan can't touch.
 
**Habetrot:**
No one just captures Morgan. All she has to do is send things away, as always.
 
**Habetrot:**
But that's not even on the table. You guys are gonna beat Morgan outright.
 
**Habetrot:**
I only have my bride on my mind. After that comes supporting you.
 
**Habetrot:**
After all, what goes better with a joyful bride than a strapping groom?
 
**Habetrot:**
For Mash's and my sake alike, I won't let you die.
 
**Habetrot:**
After all, my dream is to send off a hundred happy brides!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I get it. That's a nice dream.|
 
**Habetrot:**
Right? I bet I've got a good shot at being a bride master by that point!
 
**Habetrot:**
Ah, but mind that Beryl Gut. He's kind of a prospective groom, himself.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What bride number is Mash?
 
**Habetrot:**
The very first.
 
**Habetrot:**
I don't know about the Habetrot from your side in pan-human history, but my dream started with Mash.
 
**Habetrot:**
Oh, and kindly introduce me to any Servants of yours struggling with wedding planning, would you?
 
**Habetrot:**
I can tailor any dress to any need!
 
**Habetrot:**
Human or monster, male or female...Habetrot will help anyone with dreams of bridedom!
 

---

 
**Londinium Boy:**
Oh, here you are. Hey, ever-cheery fairy girl!
 
**Gareth:**
...? You're talking to me, right? Me, Gareth?
 
**Londinium Boy:**
So you're named Gareth! It's short but sounds brave! I like it!
 
**Gareth:**
W-well, hello. The whole Gareth thing is...
 
**Gareth:**
(I just kind of started going by the name... It's not something anyone gave me...)
 
**Gareth:**
Well, never mind that! Do you have business with Artoria?
 
**Gareth:**
You were engulfed by your platoon in the square a while ago. Doesn't a kid have trouble forming up like that?
 
**Gareth:**
If you'll wait, I can bring you back&mdash;
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Naw. All the grown-ups are here for the Child of Prophecy and Percival.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
But we want to stand with you, Gareth.
 
**Gareth:**
With me!? But for what&mdash;
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Just come on with us. The rest are waiting for you.
 
**Gareth:**
Awawa, don't pull me by my hem! I'll follow, okay!?
 
**Boys and Girls:**
Look! Shem's bringing the charging girl!
 
**Gareth:**
(Wow, so many human kids. Did this many escape to Londonium?)
 
**Gareth:**
Huh, isn't this the castle smithy?
 
**Londinium Boy:**
That's right, we're helping out since she's shorthanded!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Hey, old lady! We brought her! Go on, get it off!
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
Yes, yes. I know. Come here, young lady.
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
The youngsters wouldn't quit bothering me to make you a new suit of armor.
 
**Gareth:**
&mdash;Huh? My armor...?
 
**Gareth:**
Wow, is this a mithril shield!? Not even the knights in the Queen's army have these!
 
**Gareth:**
N-n-no, ma'am. I can't take something this expensive!
 
**Gareth:**
Besides, this should be a gift for Artoria! It's not for someone like me to wear.
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
Now now, no more of that. Are you doubting the eyes of these children?
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
The ones abandoned by Norwich raised most of the money on your behalf.
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
And not for the Child of Prophecy or for Percival.
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
I was downright charmed, seeing you charging into battle with your small body. You really think you're just “someone”?
 
**Gareth:**
...But I'm just a random fairy with no clue of my purpose.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
...? What's the big deal? Fairies are fairies, aren't they? Who cares what their job is supposed to be?
 
**Londinium Boy:**
You protected Londinium.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
When you first got here, you helped Juli when she tripped and lost the fruit that fell out of her bag.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
You saved Samaria from being captured by Woodwose's soldiers when she was out looking for food.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Human kids like us aren't much help to anyone.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
We're lucky to live six months. Nobody was around to protect me...
 
**Londinium Boy:**
But you didn't give it a second thought, and fought like crazy.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
So we wanted to give you our thanks. Samaria, go ahead.
 
**Londinium Girl:**
Yes! Here you go, Miss Knight! Thank you for saving us so many times!
 
**Londinium Girl:**
But you're always getting whacked around, so we got real worried!
 
**Londinium Girl:**
So we asked the old smith lady to make something to keep you safe!
 
**Gareth:**
&mdash;So that I'm kept safe? You all have more scars than I do.
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
See, it makes no difference to them what kind of fairy you are.
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
I had nothing left after Norwich, so I came here to find a place to die.
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
But I saw I had plenty more to do, as you can see. Back in active service.
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
I thought all this time that we were all born for a specific purpose.
 
**Earth Clan Blacksmith:**
Lending someone help or being asked for it gives oneself a new “role”.
 
**Percival:**
There you are, Gareth. Come, let's start training.
 
**Percival:**
Today we'll polish that charge utilizing your rushing power. Your instincts are good as is, so anticipate the enemy's movements and...
 
**Percival:**
Gareth? What's wrong with you? You don't look well.
 
**Gareth:**
...No, it's nothing...Really, it isn't...
 
**Gareth:**
Yeah, it was nothing...
 
**Gareth:**
I didn't have any lofty desires to save Britain, or anything else...
 
**Gareth:**
It just seemed like something simple that anyone could do...
 
**Percival:**
...I see. Yes, there are happy things like that which can still bring you to tears.
 
**Percival:**
I'm glad you had that meeting. This is a big day for you, so let's leave things here.
 
**Gareth:**
No, I'd rather work harder! Can't I work twice as hard!?
 
**Gareth:**
Because, I'm a knight of Londinium! There's got to be more I can do!
 
**Percival:**
Haha, another knight of Londinium showing her worth! You always know just what to say, Gareth.
 
**Gareth:**
Huh? I couldn't be more serious. Percival, you don't have to be rude just because you're strong.
 
**Percival:**
You're right, please excuse me. But Gareth, you don't seem to know the tale.
 
**Gareth:**
...?
 
**Percival:**
Right, the knights of Londinium were those who fought the clans during the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Percival:**
The human king who brought victory...
 
**Percival:**
That was what they called the Last Knight, who was the savior Tonelico's consort.
 
**Gareth:**
I'm sorry, it was me who was rude and disrespectfullll!
 
**Percival:**
That's well and good for a knight of Londinium. Finer than even the Round Table Army.
 
**Percival:**
You're at least more worthy of the name than I, because you sincerely try to protect this place.
 
**Gareth:**
Um...
 
**Gareth:**
I didn't feel right to ask at the time, so I kept quiet...
 
**Gareth:**
But you didn't mention your fight with Lancelot back in the Welsh forest to Artoria and the others...
 
**Gareth:**
Back then...
 
**Percival:**
Tsk...!
 
**Percival:**
(I can read her movements, but can't defend against them...! Is she truly something that human eyes cannot track?)
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Oh, your skills managed to compensate. Then, you've managed to grow up a little after all?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...Even so, you can't keep up with me. You never could.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Too much difference in basic structure, magical energy capacity, and time spent. It's time you gave it up.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No, that won't do either. After all, you never were a boy who took to good advice.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
So&mdash;it may be pointless, but I'll tell you one thing.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Do NOT use that spear, Percival. It's too much for any human.
 
**Gareth:**
Could it be that...
 
**Gareth:**
You and Lancelot already know each other?
 
**Percival:**
Well...
 
**Percival:**
...Yes, Lancelot is a fellow student who honed her skills along with me.
 
**Percival:**
But nothing more. We were only together for a few years.
 
**Percival:**
I'm sorry if it's been bothering you. Now I am merely Percival, commander of the Round Table Army.
 
**Percival:**
Lancelot and I are enemies. We've neither mercy nor words for one another.
 
**Percival:**
Why, I'm sure to triumph when we next fight.
 
**Percival:**
You and everyone else will be lending a hand when that time comes, won't you?
 
**J：Round Table Army Soldier A:**
I've heard so much about your efforts in Norwich!
 
**J：Round Table Army Soldier A:**
Morgan probably couldn't drive off a Mors the size of a castle!
 
**Artoria:**
That was the power of the foreign magus and the Knight of Sheffield.
 
**Artoria:**
The achievement isn't mine alone. It's thanks to all of you.
 
**J：Round Table Army Soldier B:**
The battle just now was astonishing! Power like a raging storm despite a feather-light body!
 
**J：Round Table Army Soldier B:**
That cowardly Woodwose is no match for Lady Artoria's magecraft!
 
**Artoria:**
Thank you, but my magecraft isn't limitless.
 
**Artoria:**
Please don't strike out too far ahead. If you feel tired, fall back at once.
 
**Round Table Army Fairy Soldiers:**
May I tell the tale of what happened in Gloucester, Child of Prophecy?
 
**Round Table Army Fairy Soldiers:**
Not only was Tristan browbeaten, but also given a direct taste of her own medicine!
 
**Round Table Army Fairy Soldiers:**
So many fairies have been slain by Tristan without cause, while there's no defying the Queen's daughter...
 
**Round Table Army Fairy Soldiers:**
Indeed, fairies all across Britain have been praying for that girl to be brought to justice!
 
**Round Table Army Fairy Soldiers:**
Following Barghest, please strive to next destroy that wicked Fairy Knight!
 
**Artoria:**
I will, if the opportunity presents itself. Confronting the Fairy Knights is inevitable.
 
**Artoria:**
Queen Morgan's daughter will receive her just deserts for her misdeeds.
 
**Round Table Army Soldiers:**
Ah, reliable indeed! Truly the undefeated king, the savior of the battlefield!
 
**Round Table Army Soldiers:**
Hooray for the Child of Prophecy! Hooray for Artoria!
 
**Artoria:**
Sigh...
 
**Artoria:**
They're not bad people, but they tire me out twice as much as usual...
 
**Artoria:**
I'd forgotten what this felt like, not since Tintagel...
 
**Artoria:**
With no trace of confidence in me, I might have blundered...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It ain't that obvious with you. You put on a good show of innocence.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The Child of Prophecy oughta be used to entertaining. Was it anything like this in your hometown?
 
**Artoria:**
...No, it really wasn't.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
They must've gotten to you worse than it looked. Normally, you'd bite my head off here.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Was it really so debilitating that you don't even have the vigor to snap back at me?
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, no...now I have Muramasa fussing over me? That's even more ghastly...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, sorry to have disturbed you then! I'm sure you'll be fine if I just let you be!
 
**Artoria:**
Sorry. I'm kidding, really! You actually are worried for me, Muramasa.
 
**Artoria:**
I didn't mean to bother you, but thanks!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Nah, I've got tomorrow's battle on my mind more.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Having the standard-bearer looking so down isn't any way to bring in victory.
 
**Artoria:**
I see. A pity.
 
**Artoria:**
But there's really no cause for concern. I've been fighting all day, so I'm just a bit tired.
 
**Artoria:**
And you see, I don't really get along well with the people in the Round Table Army.
 
**Artoria:**
Everyone's got their own reasons.
 
**Artoria:**
For the fairies, or for humans, vengeance against the Queen, or just a better tomorrow...
 
**Artoria:**
Reasons as heavy as that are enough to put me off my nerve.
 
**Artoria:**
After all, the only reason I'm here is because I'm the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Artoria:**
I like to fight, and I'm fighting well. But I'm aghast at the idea of being praised for it!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
&mdash;To fight well, huh?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I don't think anyone great in battle would wish for all that.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Fujimaru still retained a lot of {(M)his/(F)her} good charm despite diving for Holy Grails.
 
**Artoria:**
Um...Muramasa, what exactly did you see in that...?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What the hell's a Child of Prophecy good for if that's all she wants out of it?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
This old fart hates to rain on anyone's parade. But if nobody's going to say it, then I will.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Artoria. You're not cut out for fighting, kid.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;But...if I stop here, won't everyone be in danger?
 
**Artoria:**
So it's okay. Everything's fine!
 
**Artoria:**
I know it's beyond me to try, and I lack all confidence in my attempts...
 
**Artoria:**
But, I think I can at least succeed at ringing the Pilgrim's Bells! Tomorrow, I'll do my best as the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's it for contacting the Border...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh? What are you doing up at this hour, Fujimaru?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Other than the soldiers on guard duty, it's time everyone got their rest. I was about to turn in, myself.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But if you can't sleep, why don't we chat for a bit? There's stuff on your mind, isn't there?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Back when we were talking to Count Peperon...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What was it that humans can't manage?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ah, you mean that...
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Right, I can't keep that a secret forever.
 
**Da Vinci:**
“A human born in the Fairy Kingdom can only exist there,”
 
**Da Vinci:**
is how Peperoncino put it, but I think what he really meant to say was:
 
**Da Vinci:**
“A human made in the Fairy Kingdom cannot exist in the outside world.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
You've seen a lot of sides to this realm. The prisons housing humans, that farm being one of them.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You understand what that place was really for, don't you?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...A factory for manufacturing humans, right?|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Right. The facility Artoria warned us to look away from was a huge factory for producing human beings.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I thought it'd be more akin to homunculi.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But, after observing the human denizens of the Fairy Kingdom, I could tell that wasn't the case.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The people of the Fairy Kingdom are clones of “a single human being”, made by rearranging their elements.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Piling on rearrangements and duplications, maybe hundreds of millions of times over, from the first person's raw material.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The genealogy here is as rich and varied as that of humanity in our history.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Only the humans in the Fairy Kingdom have no ability to reproduce, and live with a predetermined lifespan.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That probably wasn't by design, but caused by the limitations of the cellular foundation.
 
**Da Vinci:**
When I arrived in Salisbury, the first thing that struck me was the absence of any elders.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There were many old fairies, but no old humans.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But how does that determine they can't exist...?|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes. This depends on the lifespan back then of the single human they were founded on.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Queen's Calendar, which began with Morgan's reign after withering the Fantasy Tree.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Fairy Kingdom that Morgan rules over can no longer be called a Lostbelt, but a Lostworld.
 
**Da Vinci:**
A new “Compilation Event”, if you will. The lives born here could exist in pan-human history.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But before that...Britain's Fairy Calendar, established after the Fantasy Tree took root in this place, was itself a “Pruning Event”...a Lostbelt.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Life born in a Lostbelt can only exist in a Lostbelt.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Throne of Heroes...crossing the bounds as a higher-order phenomena is a different story, of course.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But it isn't a simple thing to be engraved there.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Still, it's all speculation. There are simply no humans native to Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The positions of fairies and humans have been reversed with the latter's forced conception.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fairies have become real, and humans have become fantasy. They're what we call “fictional”.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's why humans from the Fairy Kingdom can't live in the reality which we call pan-human history.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...It's your decision how to feel about the state of humanity here.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You might think you can change or stop it, but don't leave the decision to anyone else.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Others might call it illusory, but it's the only life those here have ever known.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Everybody who lives has a limit. A set amount of time to be up and running.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Don't grieve because it was short. It may be a little sad, but that's all.
 
**Da Vinci:**
What's important is where the goal is and how far towards it you ran.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And I don't mean distance here. It's about direction in life and meaning of existence&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
This just goes to affirm that we're domesticated lifeforms, capable of reaching an eventual endpoint.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 
**Da Vinci:**
Aw come on, why do you look like you're about to cry?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I said there's no reason to grieve.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Chatting with you can really wrack the brain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But of course. I'm the perfected genius, made by the renaissance genius!
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Still, you see the danger when looking at things the opposite way.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Humans in the Fairy Kingdom can't leave Britain, but fairies can break free.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If Morgan expands her dominion as she said she would&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Some of those fairies might try to emerge into pan-human history.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And if one of them has malice comparable to an Evil of Humanity&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Collapse...!|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, so I'd like you to take a look at this mural.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The one titled “Insect of the Abyss”.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Basically, the legends of the Fairy Kingdom were prophecies left behind by the Mirror Clan.
 
**Da Vinci:**
To that end, this mural is very likely a prophecy of a possible future.
 
**Da Vinci:**
In a Britain without gods, the six clans did revere a great beast.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There were too many ears around earlier, so I kept my mouth shut.
 
**Da Vinci:**
This pattern here, below the mural?
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's not a fairy language, so the fairies here might not comprehend.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But these are probably hieroglyphics, older even than ancient Hebrew.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Maybe...14,000 years old. It's a language used by prehistoric civilizations in pan-human history.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Or possibly&mdash;the one who left this behind purposefully used a language only humans in the future could understand.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can you read it...?|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course. Only one word is inscribed.
 
**Da Vinci:**
&mdash;Cernunnos.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The name of an old Celtic god...and proof there once was a god in this land.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Fairy Knight, Lord Lancelot. Former Fairy Knight Gawain, Lord Barghest.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
They have both returned from your task of gaining control over the forest of Wales.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Both Fairy Knights shall deliver their report to Her Majesty Queen Morgan.
 
**Morgan:**
State your reports. Tell the truth of what transpired, and only the truth.
 
**Barghest:**
Your Highness. As you commanded, the Welsh forest has been purged.
 
**Barghest:**
In the midst of this, we engaged in battle with the Child of Prophecy, the foreign magus, and the rebel Oberon.
 
**Barghest:**
I have lost the gifted name Your Majesty bestowed upon me, and have returned to my former form as Barghest.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Kyahahahaha! Oh, this is rich! Sir Gawain, defeated!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's so cute when a puppy comes crawling back home with her tail between her legs.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
So? What's your excuse? This is the second time you've let the Child of Prophecy escape.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Even Mother won't be so kind to you this time, you know.
 
**B：Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The mission Her Majesty gave us was a success. The forest was cleansed.
 
**B：Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Barghest ceased combat because it was no longer necessary.
 
**B：Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Fairy Knight Gawain was not defeated. &mdash;unlike you, Tristan.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
...sorry, did you say something? It's hard to tell with that mask of yours.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
If you wanna back talk with me, how about not hiding behind it for once!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I'm not back-talking. I simply state the facts.
 
**Fairy Officers:**
L-lord Lancelot has shown her face...!?
 
**Fairy Officers:**
They say you can only see it during ceremonies...! We must be blessed!
 
**Fairy Officers:**
Hair like strands of silver, golden eyes that sparkle like crystals&mdash;Truly, the one and only dragon fairy who split the heavens themselves...!
 
**Barghest:**
...Lancelot. Please don't trouble yourself. I don't need you trying to defend me.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It's nothing. My mask was a nuisance, so I took it off. It has nothing to do with you.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
What, Lancelot's joining the band of losers!? You're not even pretending to be proud of it!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
(...what's up with Lancelot? Did something happen...? She's easily provoked, but this is different...)
 
**Barghest:**
Your Highness. The truth is that I was defeated.
 
**Barghest:**
I've besmirched the name of Fairy Knight and the trust you have placed in me.
 
**Barghest:**
Please hand down your punishment. I humbly accept it.
 
**Morgan:**
Indeed. It is unthinkable that a Fairy Knight would be defeated by the Child of Prophecy of all people.
 
**Morgan:**
I sentence you to confinement in your holdings.
 
**Morgan:**
You must be tired after ceaselessly protecting the Fairy Kingdom these past 200 years.
 
**Fairy Officer:**
She's been relegated to Manchester...! The Black Dog Lord is retiring from the capital!
 
**Fairy Officer:**
This is our chance! Let's quickly raise a knight to replace her. To be given the Gifted Name of a Fairy Knight...!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
(Morons. There's nobody who could possibly fill her shoes.)
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
(...But are you really sure you should just dismiss her, Mother? Won't Woodwose need her as backup?)
 
**Fairy Officer:**
Please wait, Your Majesty! Barghest must atone on the field of battle for her crimes!
 
**Fairy Officer:**
We are currently receiving reports of a growing insurgency in Londinium.
 
**Fairy Officer:**
We can't rely on the Fang Clan alone. Take Barghest here,
 
**Fairy Officer:**
and send her off to defeat the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Morgan:**
Don't make me laugh. You think Woodwose can be defeated by humans?
 
**Fairy Officer:**
B-but Lord Woodwose is already over 1,000 years old. Surely he is no longer able to wage war&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
...My, such ignorance truly is bliss.
 
**Fairy Officer:**
...?
 
**Morgan:**
I've already dispatched reinforcements to Oxford. They'll meet Woodwose's army tomorrow.
 
**Morgan:**
That will be sufficient to bring down Londinium. There is no need to expend Barghest's life.
 
**Fairy Officer:**
I-is that so? A-as expected of Your Majesty, such an enlightened decision...haha...
 
**Morgan:**
Barghest. What of the knight Portunes?
 
**Morgan:**
I have received no word from him. I don't suppose he died in battle?
 
**Barghest:**
Hm?
 
**Barghest:**
(Portunes hasn't returned...? What happened after that...?)
 
**Barghest:**
...Knight Portunes and I went our separate ways after the forest was purged.
 
**Barghest:**
I have no knowledge of his current whereabouts.
 
**Morgan:**
I see. If you don't know,
 
**Morgan:**
then perhaps he was defeated by the foreign magus, or ran into a pack of Mors.
 
**Morgan:**
Whatever the case, he will be presumed dead now that his reports have ceased being delivered.
 
**Morgan:**
The quality of fairies has fallen. Even knights who once survived the Mors War have ended up in this mess.
 
**Morgan:**
Very well. Stand down, officer. Looking at your incompetent face depresses me.
 
**Fairy Officer:**
...Yessir...as you wish. Please, excuse my embarrassment...
 
**Barghest:**
Please wait, Your Majesty. Allow me to make a recommendation.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Are you offering up your head? As sincere as ever, I see.
 
**Morgan:**
Very well, I shall allow it. This is obviously nonsense, but speak.
 
**Barghest:**
Your Majesty, I do not think that the foreign magus is an invader here to destroy Britain.
 
**Barghest:**
{(M)He/(F)She}, along with the Child of Prophecy, purified Norwich of the Calamity,
 
**Barghest:**
answered Her Majesty's summons, and appeared in Wales to defend the forest.
 
**Barghest:**
{(M)He/(F)She} is a far more trustworthy individual than Knocknarea, who seeks only to disrupt the harmony of our kingdom.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Barghest.
 
**Barghest:**
...the Great Calamity draws near, so we should not seek fights needlessly.
 
**Barghest:**
If {(M)he/(F)she} is not our enemy, then {(M)his/(F)her} knowledge becomes a powerful weapon.
 
**Barghest:**
Please allow me to enter into negotiations with pan-human history.
 
**Barghest:**
The Child of Prophecy is nothing more than a rebel, but the foreign magus is an ally to we fae&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
That's enough. I can no longer dismiss this as nonsense, Barghest.
 
**Morgan:**
No matter what danger we face, collaborating with pan-human history is out of the question.
 
**Morgan:**
It is indeed as you fear, the fairies who exist now will all be killed by the Great Calamity.
 
**Morgan:**
But that is all I will say. So long as Britain and myself remain safe, that is all that matters.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Y-yes, Your Majesty! Your unwavering determination is most amazing!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Killed by the Great Calamity? But Camelot will be spared, won't it?)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Of course it will be, how could she rule Britain by herself?)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(After all, Her Majesty is a fairy. Without us, there's no point in preserving the kingdom!)
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Yeah! You don't know anything, do you Barghest!?
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
How many times do you need to be told, Mother doesn't care about the fairies!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Aah, seeing all you losers get all flustered... this is the best!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
If this what a farce is like, I bet the real thing is even better!
 
**Barghest:**
(&mdash;what is she saying?)
 
**Barghest:**
(Does Her Majesty...really have no intention of saving the fairies...!?)
 
**Beryl:**
...I see. I get the gist about the Queen's reinforcements.
 
**Beryl:**
Nothing from me. Depending on how things go, I may take advantage of it.
 
**Beryl:**
Fujimaru is the main dish this time. I'm less interested in the battle between Woodwose and the Round Table Army&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
Whoa now, Peperoncino's in Londinium?
 
**Beryl:**
...Seriously? Had I snuck in, I would have stepped on a huge landmine.
 
**Beryl:**
I owe you for the tip-off, mate.
 
**Beryl:**
I'll be sure to steer clear of Londinium then. Yeah, we'll have plenty more chances down the road.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
That was the absolute best&ndash;! Barghest was shaking all over!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I'm back, darling! Hey listen, Mother did the absolute worst&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
...Hey. Was there someone here just now?
 
**Beryl:**
Hm? Oh, you're back early, Lady Spinel!
 
**Beryl:**
Wow, so that's Morgan's Infinity Mirror, huh? It's like True Magic!
 
**Beryl:**
We couldn't move around so easily back in pan-human history.
 
**Beryl:**
The only ones who could do that are the witches left in the dust by the ages. That alone is worth respecting.
 
**Beryl:**
These fairies don't get how truly horrifying Morgan is.
 
**Beryl:**
In their hearts, they're laughing at her as “a fairy who can't perform Sacraments without using magecraft.”
 
**Beryl:**
If I had to say, it's the other way around. She's “a cheating monster that can use magecraft on top of being a fairy.”
 
**Beryl:**
This could be called shifting between dimensional connections itself, by connecting a parent mirror with a number of child ones.
 
**Beryl:**
The twelve “Spears at the World's Edge” situated on Camelot's main gate.
 
**Beryl:**
The great Bounded Field, the “Tower” that covers the island of Britain. The “Garden” where Merlin is sealed.
 
**Beryl:**
And on top of all that, Rayshifting without a coffin, something Chaldea has never been able to do!
 
**Beryl:**
And nobody would have thought she would dispatch the Calamity to so long ago, and push her debt into the “past”!
 
**Beryl:**
No, she's more than enough all by herself! Having Fairy Knights just makes her super broken!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I know, right~! I knew you'd get it, Beryl~!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
She doesn't even need three Fairy Knights. Why doesn't Mother just use only me?
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I've told her so many times...I'm the only one who needs to be special...
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I'm her only daughter...and Mother almost never speaks to me...
 
**Beryl:**
Hey, Morgan's just embarrassed.
 
**Beryl:**
You're growing to be every bit the adorable little princess she expected you to be.
 
**Beryl:**
You know how much she cares for you, right? After all, she gave you one of the Infinity Mirror's child terminals.
 
**Beryl:**
No matter what happens, no matter where you are, you're always close at hand if Morgan calls.
 
**Beryl:**
If that's not her showing affection, then what is?
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
O-oh? Then does she really love me? Am I worthy of being her daughter?
 
**Beryl:**
Yeah, as an outsider, it's almost sickening! Morgan wants you to be free.
 
**Beryl:**
Who cares what the fairies think? Do whatever you want, Princess!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Of course. The more I hear them scream, the more excited I get!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I came to Woodwose's battlefields so that I could see all the corpses littering the ground!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's too bad my Noble Phantasm is Anti-Unit though. I'm jealous of Barghest.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I could ask Mother to swap...but I don't think “Gawain” can be used anymore...
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
What's more annoying is that Child of Prophecy... I didn't expect her to take down Barghest.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Is the Chaldean Master really that strong? Strong enough to defeat a Fairy Knight?
 
**Beryl:**
...That's true. {(M)He/(F)She}'s come this far, so I'd better seriously evaluate {(M)him/(F)her}.
 
**Beryl:**
Setting aside how {(M)he/(F)she} is as a magus, as a Master, {(M)he/(F)she} is first-rate.
 
**Beryl:**
If you think about it, {(M)he/(F)she}'s amassed a ton of experience by now.
 
**Beryl:**
You couldn't beat Kirschtaria Wodime on just luck.
 
**Beryl:**
{(M)He/(F)She} beat that aristocrat, so {(M)he/(F)she}'s more of a Master than I am.
 
**Beryl:**
A good Master should have a genuine connection with their Servant.
 
**Beryl:**
A Master and Servant act as one. It was the strength of that bond that defeated Barghest.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
...Acting as one...no deceptions...no betrayal...
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
You're a Master too, right Beryl? Do you have a Servant already?
 
**Beryl:**
I wonder? Maybe I just haven't made a contract yet?
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
What's that all about!? Seriously, you're slacking, Red Beryl!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
But this must be fate! Wonderful, wonderful fate!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Hey! Hey Beryl! How about I become your Servant!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Even though I'm a fairy, even though I'm hated, have I met my fated partner!?
 
**Beryl:**
Aah. I wonder, can a fairy even be a Servant?
 
**Beryl:**
I'll contract with you if I feel like it, Princess. But let's talk about tomorrow's murders together first.
 
**Beryl:**
I'm just about done with my business in Londinium. There's just one last thing to do.
 
**Beryl:**
Then, all that's left is to build towards the future. I'd like your help with that.
 
## Section 15: Londonium Defense 
 
**Habetrot:**
Wow, all the soldiers are eating together in the plaza. It really does feel like the calm before the storm, huh?
 
**Habetrot:**
Fujimaru and the others are all here too. Weren't you supposed to get started later?
 
**Gareth:**
Yeah, but we thought it would be wrong if we were the only ones who got to take a break in the operations room.
 
**Gareth:**
Have you tried these jam buns, Habenyan? Aren't they tasty?
 
**Habetrot:**
Nah, stuff like that gives me heartburn. Anyway... aren't you missing someone?
 
**Habetrot:**
Hey, Muramasa. Quit looking so sleepy and tell me where Oberon is.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Hm? Oh, Oberon...come to think of it, I haven't seen him.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I've been in the workshop since last night working on some minor stuff...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But, you see, Oberon's always flying all over the place.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Londinium isn't exactly filled to the brim with women, you know?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
He's that sort of guy. Maybe he snuck off to Salisbury to schmooze with Aurora.
 
**Artoria:**
...Hmm. I want to say he wouldn't do that since he's not a slob like you are, but I can't exactly deny the possibility...
 
**Oberon:**
Hmm? You're on the right track there, Muramasa, but you made a mistake. Honestly, Coral is more my type than Aurora is.
 
**Habetrot:**
Speak of the devil! Oberon!
 
**Gareth:**
Good morning, Oberon!
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, morning everybody. Habetrot and Gareth, you two are angels.
 
**Oberon:**
Don't grow up to be like these two who gossip about other people's relationships every chance they get.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Sorry about that. But you should be more careful with how you act.
 
**Oberon:**
I'm fine with it, I got my fame from dramas originally anyway.
 
**Oberon:**
My job is to sell dreams to anyone and everyone who loves stories. Isn't that right, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, maybe so.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who might that be?
 
**Oberon:**
Oh, what's with the serious face all of a sudden? Well, let's see...
 
**Oberon:**
Those who love the life they have. Those that know the value of their own life.
 
**Oberon:**
On top of that, you can dream of a “what-if” fantasy different from your current life.
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's almost midday...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The battle starts in half a day...right?
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
Yes. I wonder if Percy-boy and his merry men have come ashore yet.
 
**Count Peperon:**
To keep Woodwose from finding out, we've posted soldiers on the ramparts to show that we're still ready to defend, but...
 
**Count Peperon:**
Now that we've sent out commandos, our defenses here are undermanned.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I just hope this standoff lasts until the evening.
 
**Artoria:**
Woodwose is the Fang Clan leader. I've heard he's cautious and calculating due to his position as Head.
 
**Artoria:**
Refugees from Norwich who fled to Salisbury. Volunteers from Norwich.
 
**Artoria:**
Woodwose knows that our forces are increasing in strength,
 
**Artoria:**
so unless there's a serious problem, he won't attack the fortress with his current forces&mdash;
 
**Londinium・Sentry Soldier:**
&mdash;Here comes trouble. They're coming... they're coming!
 
**Londinium・Sentry Soldier:**
Enemy attack, enemy attack&mdash;! Woodwose's command unit is heading this way!
 
**Londinium・Sentry Soldier:**
What is he doing!? Has he lost his mind!?
 
**Londinium・Sentry Soldier:**
He should know that he can't take Londinium with just two companies...!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's your serious problem...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Artoria! Oberon!
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
I know, we need to move now! We can't hold the fortress in this condition!
 
**Oberon:**
The archers' arrows bottomed out yesterday! They'll be out of ammo in an hour!
 
**Oberon:**
Aurelia Platoon, take the front, Landon Platoon, hurry up and head out from the east gate!
 
**Oberon:**
Count, can I trust you to take command of the Norwich volunteers!?
 
**Count Peperon:**
I'm on it. I'll head out the west gate and hit Woodwose on his right flank.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Most of them will probably be turned back though, but it should make it easier for the front and left.
 
**Count Peperon:**
If we can buy time with Aurelia and Landon, then&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Percival and his men can hit Woodwose's back lines!
 
**Oberon:**
That's right. If Woodwose was in such a hurry to win, he should take better care of his defenses!
 
**Oberon:**
If we can keep them from entering the fortress, we win. But if they make it through the front gate, we lose!
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria, Fujimaru! Cover Aurelia...wait, no,
 
**Oberon:**
you'll be protecting Londinium as the core of the defense!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...We're off!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're leaving the inside to you, Oberon!
 

---

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Woodwose's Army・Messenger Soldier:**
Our battle formation in front of Londinium has been completed!
 
**Woodwose's Army・Messenger Soldier:**
The Round Table Army has deployed 200 troops from the north gate of Londinium, as well as the east and west gates on either side.
 
**Woodwose's Army・Messenger Soldier:**
They're preparing to attack our main camp from three sides!
 
**Woodwose:**
Excellent report. A suitable expression for a human soldier.
 
**Woodwose:**
How do you see the situation? As another human being, I permit you to express your opinion.
 
**Woodwose:**
Do they seem to be preparing for a skirmish, only to then escape to the castle as before?
 
**Woodwose's Army・Messenger Soldier:**
That's...no. I can't put it into words, but these guys seem serious, I guess...
 
**Woodwose's Army・Messenger Soldier:**
It feels like they have no intention of withdrawing.
 
**Woodwose's Army・Messenger Soldier:**
Somehow they have vigour to do whatever it takes to keep Lord Woodwose back.
 
**Woodwose:**
Ha&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
Hahahahaha! Yes, that's right, certainly, they're buying time!
 
**Woodwose:**
That most likely means Percival is not here. I'm well aware of the fact that we're being attacked by a detached force.
 
**Woodwose:**
After all, if I were him, I would do the same. But he's a day too late.
 
**Woodwose:**
At this very moment, he will have shedded his skin after seeing our campground, his face having turned pale.
 
**Woodwose:**
And that's not all. When he was rushing over here, he would have come across the reinforcements from Her Majesty the Queen.
 
**Woodwose:**
Even if he could fend off the reinforcements, he'd be pincered between my main camp and Her Majesty's army.
 
**Woodwose:**
Whatever the case, he cannot return to Londinium. As such&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
The Round Table Army without its main force is nothing more than glasswork. Let's break it head-on.
 
**Woodwose:**
Hurry up, advance! Let loose on the mishmash from the west gate.
 
**Woodwose:**
It's about time we thin out their numbers on the ramparts. Send in the footmen from the scouting unit!
 
**Woodwose:**
Show no mercy, unarmed or otherwise. Same goes for women and children.
 
**Woodwose:**
...This is it. To defy the Queen, who has been protecting Britain for 2,000 years&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
Everyone who lives in Londinium is a sinner! Kill them all! Don't let any of them escape!
 
**Artoria:**
The battlefield is too wide for my Enchantment to reach...! That unit over there isn't covered!
 
**Da Vinci:**
This is bad, Landon's unit are facing off against a second line of troops! There are siege machine operators amongst them!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Artoria must remain here! Muramasa, Fujimaru!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave it to me!|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, I'll be right back once I've cut that papier mâché to pieces! Habetrot, you too, come on! We've got a lot on our plate, give us a hand!
 
**Habetrot:**
It's not my field, but screw it!
 
**Habetrot:**
It's time to get my hands dirty and assist Fujimaru!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That was an awfully out-of-place weapon... could that have been another one of Koyanskaya's interferences!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That vixen sure is a pain in the ass! She'll conduct her business with anyone and everyone!
 
**Habetrot:**
This is no time for complaining, Muramasa. There are three more of them coming our way!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Damn, there's no end to them! There's too few of us! We can't defend the east gate like this!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Some of the Fang Clan troops have jumped over the gate and entered the fortress!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!|
 

---

 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Weak. Too weak. Without their weapons of Mors toxin, these humans are nothing.
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Siege operatives, find a way to remove the magical energy barrier on the ramparts! There must be a control panel somewhere!
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Tear anyone who gets in your way into pieces! They're long out of date anyway. We have no further use for them!
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Hm? ...Oh, speak of the devil. It seems we have another human thoughtlessly running their mouth on our hands, don't we?
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Hey, brat. Where are the headquarters? If you know, tell me, and I'll grant you a swift end.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Ha...haa...ha...! Huh, uuu, uuuuuuu...!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
(Eeep, he's coming! What should I do? He's coming... he's coming...he's coming...!)
 
**Londinium Boy:**
(B-b-but, but I have to drive them away...! Granny, Yuri, and the others will be next...!)
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
...You're trembling too much to speak. Fine, this is a waste of time.
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
Probably a defective product that was discarded at the farm. How could it have survived until now?
 
**Queen's Army・Knight:**
You escaped like a rat and ended up in this dump. It makes my insides turn. You're forcing our hands until the end.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
&mdash;ah 
 
**Gareth:**
Get the hell out of here, you disgusting son of a bitch! I'll throw you down the Great Pit and you're never coming out, you idiot!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
I-it's big sister Gareth! She's so awesome, so cool&mdash;!
 
**Gareth:**
Y-yeah? Does the armor and shield you guys gave me look good on me!?
 
**Londinium Boy:**
It suits you perfectly! But you're cool with or without armor!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Knocking down the Queen's knight, big sister Gareth, that's just really awesome!
 
**Gareth:**
Really? I'll finish off any soldiers who come in, so you guys should just run further back!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Right! We're counting on you, Lady Knight! Thank you for getting angry and helping out!
 
**Gareth:**
...Of course. It's a war, there is no choice but to kill others.
 
**Gareth:**
But it should be soldier on soldier! Don't you dare touch an unarmed child!
 
**Gareth:**
If Britain doesn't have an ideal knight, then I'll become one!
 
**Gareth:**
Come on, you cowards! I'll protect all the people of Londinium!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No good, we can't push them back...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Crap, the castle moat is right at our heels...!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
The Round Table troops are holding their ground, but it's becoming too difficult...!
 
**Artoria:**
They've got better soldiers, bigger numbers...! We have to retreat into Londinium!
 
**Da Vinci:**
No, if we leave now, they'll storm the castle and take it over!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Then when Percival returns, the Round Table army will be the ones who have to besiege the castle!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Woodwose has no intention of taking any prisoners to begin with. If we let him through, there will be nothing left to protect!
 
**Artoria:**
Y-you're right! Well, in that case, we just have to fight to the death!
 
**Artoria:**
Uwaa, I can't believe this! How many more times am I going to have to do this from now on!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Calm down, Artoria!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Stay calm, Artoria!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Only after you calm down! There's no way I can calm down like this!
 
**Artoria:**
You're so accustomed to fighting yet you can't even keep your cool right now! That's just weird!
 
**Artoria:**
Look at that grin on Woodwose's face! He's there in the middle of his squad looking pompous, and he's even wearing a suit!
 
**Artoria:**
Oooh, I've had it with this! I'm gonna chuck a bomb! I can reach him from this distance, just watch&ndash;!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Eh?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You can reach Woodwose from here?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Ah.
 
**Artoria:**
I can reach him, so I could snipe him from here...! Woodwose is so confident in his victory that he's coming out to the front lines!
 
**Artoria:**
Huh? No, that's not Woodwose's main force coming to join the fray at the front...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, that's Percival! Percival's troops made it just in time&mdash;!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Woodwose:**
Hahahahahahahaha! That's it, let us crush them once and for all!
 
**Woodwose:**
After all, they're nothing more than Percival's army! Without him, they're no more than rabble!
 
**Woodwose:**
Heh, the Child of Prophecy must be trembling right now. Is she cowering in the castle like a fawn?
 
**Woodwose:**
This will atone for the failure at Tintagel! It's a relief to finally forget about that damned village!
 
**Woodwose:**
Hey, have there been any reports from those who stormed the castle earlier?
 
**Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
No, nothing has come as of yet! I think they might be having trouble finding the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
...Um, Lord Woodwose. What does the Child of Prophecy look like?
 
**Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
“A female fairy about 16 years of age, with an evil look on her face.” Is there anything else of note?
 
**Woodwose:**
No. I have not seen the face of the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Woodwose:**
I wasn't allowed to attend the Queen's audience with her.
 
**Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
O-oh, I see. However, I thought you saw her at Tintagel?
 
**Woodwose:**
I just said that I have never seen her. I don't even remember seeing so much as the back of the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Woodwose:**
Whatever, we'll occupy the castle and resolve this ordeal. Continue the assault and annihilate the Round Table army&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
Wait. What are those footsteps I hear? They're coming from behind us&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
The Queen's reinforcements...no, it's something else. The sound of these frivolous military boots, lacking both history and honor...
 
**C：Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
L-l-l-lord Woodwose! Lord Woodwose!
 
**C：Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
The enemy is attacking! They're attacking from behind! Percival of the Round Table Army has gotten behind our main camp!
 
**C：Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
We won't be able to rebuild the main camp! They've really bitten us in the ass!
 
**C：Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
I don't understand, you said there would be no attacks from behind!
 
**Woodwose:**
It can't be, have they defeated Her Majesty's reinforcements!? And in such a short period of time?!
 
**Woodwose:**
No, it can't be. It can't be! They'd never be able to do such a thing!
 
**C：Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
But the truth of the matter is that they're approaching us completely unscathed...!
 
**C：Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
We're completely exhausted from that unreasonable siege, and they have more troops than us!
 
**C：Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
At this rate, we will be surrounded! Lord Woodwose, give us orders!
 
**C：Woodwose's Army・Soldier:**
Please command your clan on the battlefield!
 
**Woodwose:**
A siege... a siege!? You want me to expose myself to the horrors of war, you bastard!?
 
**Percival:**
Aurelia on Londinium's side, Landon's troops circle around the right flank!
 
**Percival:**
Second platoon, cut through the right flank and circle around to Londinium!
 
**Percival:**
First platoon, assault the main camp with me and annihilate the enemy commander before he can reroute his forces!
 
**Percival:**
If the Child of Prophecy wants to prove herself a leader, she won't miss this opportunity! We must join forces and crush Woodwose's army!
 
**Round Table Army Soldiers:**
Ooooh! Follow Commander Percival!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's Percival! Just in time!|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No need to worry about the ramparts anymore, it's all about Woodwose's main force now! I heard Percival's voice, Artoria!
 
**Artoria:**
I got it, he's signaling us to come out to the battlefield right now! Everyone, are you ready!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course! The Fang Clan are still really strong, and if we miss this opportunity, they will retaliate!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Let's attack at once and settle this, Fujimaru.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
We've got you completely surrounded! This battle is over, Woodwose!
 
**Woodwose:**
This is impossible...! How could Percival have made it in time!?
 
**Woodwose:**
How did you make it past Her Majesty's reinforcements!? Did you ally with the King's Clan!?
 
**Percival:**
...Reinforcements...? I'm not sure what you're referring to, but...
 
**Percival:**
You foresaw our pincer attack from behind and took action beforehand.
 
**Percival:**
Our strategy was foreseen and we nearly lost the fortress, but everyone managed to hold on until the last minute somehow.
 
**Percival:**
That's all there was. Please, surrender, Lord Woodwose.
 
**Percival:**
We'll treat those who surrender respectfully as prisoners of war.
 
**Percival:**
Our only quarrel is with the Queen. Shedding fairy blood is not our objective.
 
**Woodwose:**
Impossible...the reinforcements...you didn't come in contact with them...? You had to...no, no, there's no way...!
 
**Woodwose:**
This can't...it can't...! Your Majesty...you can't have abandoned me...
 
**Woodwose:**
This can't possibly be happening&mdash;!
 
**Woodwose:**
No more acting like a gentleman! How dare you mock the trust between Her Majesty and I!
 
**Woodwose:**
Huff...huff...huff&mdash;!
 
**Woodwose:**
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
 
**Woodwose:**
Phew....phew&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;Fine then. I'll take care of you, humans.
 
**Woodwose:**
Face the true ability of Woodwose, Head of the Fang Clan&mdash;I'll shred you into mincemeat!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;So this is it? It's exactly as I imagined it.
 
**Woodwose:**
No matter how much it accumulates, dust remains dust. Battle can only be carried out by a truly powerful fairy.
 
**Woodwose:**
Under Her Majesty's Fairy Kingdom, “soldier” is merely a job given to the incompetent.
 
**Woodwose:**
No matter how heavily you outnumber me, you can't kill one with true strength.
 
**Woodwose:**
Now then, time to feast. This form is rather bestial, so I hope you're not expecting fine manners from me.

**Fujimaru 1:**
...No good, I can't move...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I've got to do something...!)
 

---

 
**Percival:**
(...Well, time to get scolded again...)
 
**Percival:**
...hah&mdash;haaaaaaah...
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;Oh?
 
**Percival:**
(...The very power of a king, the personification of beautiful wildness. Essentially, it isn't something we humans should lay our hands on...)
 
**Percival:**
(...However! I have my own reasons to not die here...!)
 
**Percival:**
Holy spear, call to order&mdash;! My actions, my barbarity...pass judgement unto them...!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Percival:**
...hah&mdash;haaaaaaah...
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;Oh?
 
**Percival:**
Haaaaaaah...!
 
**Percival:**
Holy spear, call to order&mdash;! My actions, my barbarity...pass judgement unto them...!
 
**Percival:**
......!
 
**Woodwose:**
Of course I know this. Aurora told me of that spear's power.
 
**Woodwose:**
I wish you had used it in the Tournament of Robins. It would have been great to see Lancelot brought to her knees.
 
**Woodwose:**
By the way, I was the one who named that tournament. Did you know that, pitiful Percival?
 
**Woodwose:**
I had hoped the false bird would bring down the dragon. But now that possibility has passed.
 
**Woodwose:**
Kuh&mdash;kuhuahaha...
 
**Woodwose:**
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
 
**Gareth:**
Ggh, gah...! Aagh, aaaaah...!
 
**Oberon:**
What is it, Gareth!? Don't tell me you took an arrow!? Let me see!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
No, I can't see any arrows in her back or head! But something is clearly wrong with her!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Gareth, get a hold of yourself! Deep breaths, deep breaths!
 
**Gareth:**
&mdash;Rab-bit? Oberon? Thank goodness, you're both alive&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
No, that's wrong...! It was those visions again...!
 
**Gareth:**
Think, Gareth, think...! If you don't do something, everyone's gonna die!
 
**Oberon:**
...Gareth? What are you talking about...
 
**Gareth:**
Ah! Yeah, that's it! Rab-bit, I need your help!
 
**Gareth:**
You were jealous of Percival and his knight-on-horseback fighting style, right!?
 
**Gareth:**
Then, you're Kundry now!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Wha&ndash;!?
 
**Percival:**
(...Well, time to get scolded again...)
 
**Percival:**
...hah&mdash;haaaaaaah...
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;Oh?
 
**Percival:**
(...The very power of a king, the personification of beautiful wildness. Essentially, it isn't something we humans should lay our hands on...)
 
**Percival:**
(But if I don't defeat him, I can't save that person...! Fang Lord, I'm sorry&mdash;)
 
**Percival:**
Holy spear, call to order&mdash;! My actions... my barbarity...
 
**Gareth:**
WAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIT!!! Hold it right there&mdash;!
 
**Percival:**
Gareth!?
 
**E：Red Rabbit Running In:**
No, it is I!
 
**C：Horseback Gareth:**
And Gareth!
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;!  (Red Rab-bit!?)
 
**Woodwose:**
(Why would the manservant I gifted to Aurora turn against me!? No&mdash;it can't be, it can't be&mdash;)
 
**Woodwose:**
(Aurora&mdash;have even you sided with the Child of Prophecy&mdash;!?)
 
**Gareth:**
Uuuooooooooooorryyaaaaaaaaaaagh&mdash;!
 
**Woodwose:**
Fools, even iron weapons won't work on me! You should know your difference in rank as a fairy&mdash;ughuahh!?
 
**Woodwose:**
It worked after all!?
 
**Gareth:**
Percival, now!
 
**Percival:**
Understood&mdash;! My thanks, Gareth!
 
**Percival:**
Holy spear, call to order! My actions, please pardon them by virtue of my friends' courage&mdash;!
 
**Woodwose:**
Ggh...! This chill, this vertigo...! That insolent, unpleasant Spear of Selection...!
 
**Woodwose:**
You dare judge our clan!? Abominable voices from Paradiiiiiiise!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Woodwose's pressure has weakened...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now's our chance! Keep at it!
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Yes, Gareth has given us an opening! Let's all bring down Woodwose!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Woodwose:**
KuuaaaaaaAAAAAAAAGH....!
 
**Woodwose:**
Impossible, impossible!
 
**Woodwose:**
I, head of the Fang Clan, heir to the Archduke, will not be laid low by mere humans....!
 
**Woodwose:**
Absolutely not! This can't be happening, this is unthinkable!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Woodwose is escaping...! He's heading for... the River of Tears!
 
**Da Vinci:**
This is bad, if he gets away, we won't get a second chance! Somebody catch him...!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(No good, I'm out of breath, I can't do it...!)|
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Oh...oooh&mdash; Uoooooooooooahhhhh!!!!!
 
**Woodwose:**
Ggh, aagh&mdash;I can't stop the bleeding...! I can't take it...anymore...!
 
**Woodwose:**
Stay away...stay away, you failure! You bastard, who do you think raised you!?
 
**Woodwose:**
It was I! I chose you!
 
**Woodwose:**
Out of all the humans who grew and piled up like trash, I chose you!
 
**Woodwose:**
You were the only sapling with the potential to become a warrior! I recommended you on that basis!
 
**Percival:**
I know! I owe who I am to you, and I have no ill will towards you for it!
 
**Percival:**
Nonetheless, I will defeat you! The boy who was scooped up will end the life of his savior!
 
**Percival:**
Now&mdash;Lord of Oxford, forgive me!
 
**Woodwose:**
Stop, don't kill me, don't kill Britain!  
 
**Woodwose:**
Without the Fang Clan, who will defend Britain&mdash; Stop, STOOOOOOOOOOP!!!
 
**Percival:**
...Farewell, Father. You will surely find recompense in Paradise.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Woodwose's army is routing! The battle is over!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
All non-combatants can leave the shelters! Sanitation teams, assemble at the main gate!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
The surrendered soldiers will be taken to the planned living quarters in the west! Anyone planning to interview them, meet with the Kenwood unit!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
I repeat, Woodwose's army is routing! Victory is ours!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Somehow or other...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's over...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yes...somehow...everyone is safe, thankful&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Wait, no...! Percival's collapsed over there and isn't moving!
 
**Artoria:**
He needs treatment! Gareth, Gaaaaareth!
 
**Artoria:**
Get over here with Red Rab-bit! We need to get to Percival!
 
**Oberon:**
...Woodwose died in battle.
 
**Oberon:**
Twenty percent of the Fang Clan on the battlefield surrendered, and were taken as POWs by the Round Table Army.
 
**Oberon:**
The rest retreated back to Oxford.
 
**Oberon:**
Now that Woodwose is gone, they probably won't be able to function as an army.
 
**Oberon:**
...Yeah. We've crossed our second hurdle, though it cost us dearly.
 
**Oberon:**
With this, our obstacles in the south are almost cleared. What do you think, Count?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Right. We've got a foothold for our march on Camelot, don't we?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Artoria has rung two bells now and drove back Woodwose with her friends.
 
**Count Peperon:**
On top of that, it's great that they're not chasing down the Fang Clan.
 
**Count Peperon:**
They're not pursuing the retreating enemies, and they treat their prisoners of war with respect.
 
**Count Peperon:**
The Round Table Army's slogan...
 
**Count Peperon:**
“What we are aiming for is coexistence between fairies and humans. The only thing we condemn is the Queen's rule.”
 
**Count Peperon:**
They've really stuck to that up 'til now. Now the Child of Prophecy has just as much standing as the Queen.
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah. It's not like we wanted to overthrow the fairies.
 
**Oberon:**
We had no choice but to fight Woodwose, but the Fang Clan is a necessity to keep Britain safe.
 
**Oberon:**
It's not like the Great Calamity is going to stop at just Norwich. They might be strong, but the Fairy Knights can't be everywhere at once.
 
**Oberon:**
The Fang Clan's warriors are gonna be needed if there's going to be a battle against a huge outbreak of Mors.
 
**Oberon:**
As soon as the Round Table Army gets reorganized, we can have them occupy Oxford...
 
**Count Peperon:**
The question is, who's going to consolidate the Fang Clan at this point?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Percival would be the man for the job, but the Fang Clan won't follow him after he personally killed Woodwose.
 
**Count Peperon:**
If only Sheffield's Lord Boggart was still alive...
 
**Oberon:**
Leave finding a candidate for that to me.
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria's become the Child of Prophecy in both name and actions by now.
 
**Oberon:**
We'll get more collaborators from places besides just Norwich and Salisbury now.
 
**Oberon:**
We'll just have to find someone among them who can understand the Fang Clan's culture and behavior, and has the talent to lead.
 
**Oberon:**
More important is what comes next. We don't have to worry about being attacked from behind now...
 
**Count Peperon:**
Do we march on Camelot, or go after the remaining bells?
 
**Count Peperon:**
When you've got an army, you can't move around so easily...
 
**Narration:**
~Round Table Army, first aid tent~
 
**Percival:**
&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
I can hear the sound of the rain...
 
**Narration:**
2011... Salisbury Cathedral foster home...my birthday that year.
 
**Narration:**
A memorable day of celebration when, of the many candidates, I received the Spear of Selection...
 
**Narration:**
...the day the Mirror Clan vanished from Britain, leaving behind the foretelling of the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Narration:**
And...
 
**Narration:**
...the final day, when the person I loved most despaired over the thing I loved most.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Thank you for waiting, Lady Artoria.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Please be at ease, Commander Percival awoke a short time ago.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
He's surprisingly resilient and has no lingering hindrances. As expected of the pinnacle of human ability!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
When I told him you were here, he asked that I bring you to him right away.
 
**Artoria:**
Oh thank goodness...for a moment there I was wondering what we would do.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then, let's go celebrate our victory!|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yeah! Let's go tell him of the Round Table Army's great victory, and congratulate him as much as we can!
 
**Percival:**
Thanks for taking the trouble to come here Artoria, Fujimaru.
 
**Percival:**
I heard about what happened from the soldiers. Unfortunately, I collapsed, but...
 
**Percival:**
The battle wasn't dragged out, there was no pointless killing, and everyone did well.
 
**Percival:**
I'm glad they're sticking to the ideals of the Round Table Army. This should open the way to reconciliation with the Fang Clan.
 
**Percival:**
Hm? Both of you are frozen with your mouths open... ah, I see...
 
**Percival:**
No, I'm not a Deadlord. Look, I'm a human, so if I died, that would be it.
 
**Percival:**
As you can see, I'm already recovering. After all, my only good point is my resilience.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, it's just...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Umm, how do I say this...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
How can you say you're okay!? Percival, your hair changed color!
 
**Percival:**
Hm? Something's wrong with my hair?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Aurora:**
Hehe, I can hear the cries of joy from all over the city. It seems the Round Table Army is victorious.
 
**Aurora:**
Salisbury too is all caught up in the Child of Prophecy craze. Now we can welcome Artoria at any time.
 
**Aurora:**
But...it's such a shame about Woodwose...
 
**Aurora:**
Oberon requested that I occupy him somehow while the Round Table Army marched on Norwich, but...
 
**Aurora:**
...I wonder if I went too far...Woodwose, his expression was so adorable, I just...
 
**???:**
It's not your fault. Woodwose lost only because of his lack of ability.
 
**???:**
He placed too much trust in Morgan's faith in him.
 
**???:**
Such is the overconfidence of being born as an A-Rei. He shouldn't have taken the abilities of humans so lightly.
 
**Aurora:**
...You mustn't do that, my darling child. You mustn't speak ill of Her Majesty just because we're alone.
 
**Aurora:**
The Wind Clan has excellent ears. You can never be too sure someone is not eavesdropping.
 
**???:**
...I guess so. If Coral overhears us, she'll scold us again.
 
**???:**
Where is she? She's always at your side.
 
**Aurora:**
She's off greeting a messenger from Gloucester.
 
**Aurora:**
Muryan has some special news for us. Hehe, I'm looking forward to it.
 
**Aurora:**
She has ever been sensitive to the changing trends.
 
**Aurora:**
I believe she's sponsoring a new event to celebrate the Child of Prophecy's victory.
 
**???:**
...And you? Are you going to play along with her?
 
**Aurora:**
Naturally. She's a dear friend of mine. No matter what happens, I will be there.
 
**Aurora:**
You'll be coming as my knight, won't you?
 
**???:**
...I suppose. I can't let you go to Gloucester by yourself.
 
**Aurora:**
Oh, wonderful! Ah, then we'll have to find you some suitable clothes!
 
**Aurora:**
You'll frighten all the fairies around you if you wear your armor!
 
**Aurora:**
What do you think of this dress?  Or perhaps this one? Aah, how adorable!
 
**Aurora:**
You really haven't changed at all since then!
 
**Aurora:**
My most precious treasure, the most wonderful princess in Britain! I love you so, ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■!
 
**???:**
&mdash;Thank you. But you are the most beautiful thing in the world, Aurora.
 
**???:**
I am a knight only for you. I am not in Morgan's service. Don't forget that.
 
**Aurora:**
&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
That's right. You're absolutely right. That makes me so very happy, ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■.
 
**Aurora:**
But I don't think you should say things like that. You're so often misunderstood...
 
**Aurora:**
You shouldn't praise me such. From now on, Britain will be centered on the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Aurora:**
Please don't mistake who to place your trust in. Her Majesty's reign will soon come to an end.
 
**???:**
I don't care. You are my only star, Aurora. I don't really understand the current trends among fairies, or who they follow.
 
**???:**
All I want is for you to be safe&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
Oh, you'll always be such a child.
 
**Aurora:**
But perhaps that means you can give a true evaluation of the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Aurora:**
Do you think she will become the shining star of Britain, as was foretold?
 
**Aurora:**
Tell me your thoughts, won't you, ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■?
 
**???:**
&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Messenger Soldier:**
I-I beg your pardon, my Queen.
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Messenger Soldier:**
You've received an invitation to a ball from Muryan of Gloucester...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Huh!? She's holding a ball at this time of year!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
...Oh yeah, that's right. She wants to play with the Child of Prophecy now.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Her hobbies remain as sick as ever and her insides are still twisted, huh?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Just send it back. The King's Clan won't be making an appearance. Why would I ever go to a city full of humans in the first place?
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Messenger Soldier:**
U-understood.
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Officer:**
We have a report from our soldiers watching the south!
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Officer:**
The Round Table Army and the Child of Prophecy have defeated Woodwose's army!
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Officer:**
The Round Table Army suffered casualties of about 20% of their total strength, but as they're quickly replenishing forces,
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Officer:**
they're expected to take only seven days to regroup and begin their march!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I see. So Woodwose was all bark and no bite after all.
 
**Knocknarea:**
All right then. Regardless, that's one less wall between me and Camelot.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As soon as the Giant Corps is complete, we'll cross the southern border. Inform the officer corps.
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Officer:**
WoHoooo&mdash;!  Ah-ahem. Please excuse me.
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Officer:**
But I can't contain my excitement. The day has finally come when we march on Camelot!
 
**Knocknarea:**
All that's left is to prepare.
 
**Knocknarea:**
This is the continuation of a 1,000-year plan dating back to the previous King's Clan. Warn the officers to not get too excited.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well&mdash;if you want the greatest, most out-of-this-world punishment, I won't stop you.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Are you prepared to be turned into pathetic chocolate and skewered on my heels for a thousand years?
 
**Knocknarea's Army・Officer:**
M-my lady! Until we receive your blessed order, not a single one of the northern fairies will move a limb!
 
**Knocknarea:**
...Tch. Did that girl and her friends really beat Woodwose...?
 
**Knocknarea:**
He was an A-Rei, much more of a problem than the Fairy Knights. Morgan's strongest guard, the one who defeated even the Mors King, and still...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Heh, not bad. Not bad at all!
 
**Knocknarea:**
You've got no shortage of enemies, Artoria!
 
**Knocknarea:**
You're competing with me for the throne, so this is the least you can do!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I've returned. Did anything happen while I was out, Lady Muryan?
 
**Muryan:**
Yes. The preparations for the banquet are going steadily. I've just sent out the invitations to everyone.
 
**Muryan:**
What about you? It was a sudden job, but I trust there were no problems with it?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Just so. I haven't let my true nature run wild since Olympus&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Flesh and screams, souls and despair. I was able to fully enjoy it.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
It seems that Lord Woodwose has passed away as a result, but I had no control over that.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
The Child of Prophecy and the Chaldeans must have cooperated in their usual manner.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
A cornered cat will bite back, after all, though I hate using such words.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
More importantly, are you really okay with this? Another clan has dropped out of the game.
 
**Muryan:**
...I suppose so. It's a shame about Woodwose. To think he died in battle against a human...
 
**Muryan:**
But the Fang Clan remains in the game.
 
**Muryan:**
If they made it back to Oxford, they won't be so easily absorbed into the Round Table Army.
 
**Muryan:**
If what they need is time to rebuild, then I'll gladly provide it for them.
 
**Muryan:**
They can no longer rely on the Queen for deterrence... Britain's protectors, the Fang Clan, are all mine.
 
**Muryan:**
As if I would let the Child of Prophecy have them, much less some outsider.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Well then, do you mind if I ask for some time off?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
That information I bartered from Oberon... I'd like to pay a visit to the husk of the dragon.
 
**Muryan:**
...Huh. I really don't approve, but I suppose it's not my place to say.
 
**Muryan:**
I was hoping you'd have more time to talk, but this is the whole reason you came to Britain, wasn't it?
 
**Muryan:**
As your friend, I can't stand in your way. Stay safe on your journey.
 
**Muryan:**
But finish as soon as you can and come back, alright? I'm looking forward to hearing the extraordinarily wicked good news.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Why, of course. After all, I'm a woman who doesn't call a break just to waste time♡
 
**Woodwose:**
Haaah...haaaaah&mdash;!
 
**Woodwose:**
I won't...I won't die...! Who the hell...do you think I am...!?
 
**Woodwose:**
The heir to Archduke Wryneck! The hero who defeated the Mors King in the Mors War...!
 
**Woodwose:**
I've protected Britain for Her Majesty for so long... I'm the pride of my clan...!
 
**Woodwose:**
And yet, I&mdash;in such a meaningless battle&mdash;!
 
**Woodwose:**
Gah, aaaaaaaagh...! My wounds, my wounds won't close...!
 
**Woodwose:**
Damn you, Percival...! No, it was that damn fairy that did this!
 
**Woodwose:**
How could that little girl's spear do this to me...? Could it be...
 
**Woodwose:**
And that wasn't all...Red Rab-bit...Aurora's guard...
 
**Woodwose:**
If he's with the Round Table Army&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
You deserve better, Woodwose. We've worked so closely together, don't you think I know that?
 
**Aurora:**
Her Majesty has changed in the last two hundred years. She's not just promoting Fairy Knights,
 
**Aurora:**
she's even adopted a fairy from who-knows-where as her foster daughter, and taken a human from the outside as her spouse.
 
**Aurora:**
And yet, all this time, I thought you were most suited for that...
 
**Aurora:**
...this is just too sad for me to step back from...
 
**Woodwose:**
Aurora...is it really true? I thought you hated me...
 
**Aurora:**
Oh my. Why should I hate you?
 
**Aurora:**
You're a brave warrior who has saved Britain on so many occasions. Among the six clans, your blood remains the most pure.
 
**Aurora:**
There is not a single fairy who doesn't idolize you. But&mdash;you swore an oath of allegiance to the Queen.
 
**Aurora:**
If a woman such as myself became close to you, it would open a rift in your relationship with her...
 
**Aurora:**
But...you were the one who truly kept Britain safe. That's what I've always thought.
 
**Aurora:**
Ainsel's prophecy was mistaken.
 
**Aurora:**
Britain's true king is neither Her Majesty nor the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Aurora:**
&mdash;Woodwose. You are worthy of being our king&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
No...no...! Aurora, only you can...!
 
**Woodwose:**
Red Rab-bit turned traitor on his own, and now that I think about it, he's always been incomprehensible!
 
**Woodwose:**
...Yes. Salisbury...Aurora will shelter me...
 
**Woodwose:**
Now that I'm defeated, Oxford will be occupied, but...
 
**Woodwose:**
When my wounds have healed, I'll return to Oxford and destroy the Round Table Army!
 
**Woodwose:**
I am Woodwose, Head of the Fang Clan, and Britain's strongest warrior!
 
**Woodwose:**
Who needs the Fairy Knights!? If I kill them all, Her Majesty will see! She has to!
 
**Beryl:**
Wouldn't that be convenient, Woodwose?
 
**Beryl:**
How can you expect to show your face to her after losing so badly?
 
**Woodwose:**
Beryl Gut...! You bastard, what are you doing here...
 
**Woodwose:**
You...you came here to laugh at me...!
 
**Beryl:**
No, no, I don't have time for something so inconsequential! You sure are strong, Woodwose, but you're such a dunce right 'til the very end!
 
**Beryl:**
That's why Morgan gave up on you. Don't you get that you've outlived your usefulness by now?
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;What. What are you saying, you son of a bitch!?
 
**Woodwose:**
...No. No, stop. Don't say anything more! Her Majesty wouldn't...!
 
**Beryl:**
So you DO get it.
 
**Beryl:**
There's only one reason Percival could have struck you from behind, isn't there?
 
**Beryl:**
There were never any reinforcements to begin with.
 
**Beryl:**
She never even listened to you. You were seduced by another woman.
 
**Beryl:**
You were just a hindrance, you mutt. She took the opportunity to get rid of you, along with the Round Table Army.
 
**Woodwose:**
No&ndash;no&ndash;the Queen&mdash;the Queen&mdash;I&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
uuugh... UUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHH!
 
**Beryl:**
Now. Do it, Tristan.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
You got it! Just leave it to me~!
 
**Woodwose:**
Gaa&mdash;gaa&mdash;aaaaa...aaaa...aaa&mdash;aa&mdash;.........a.........
 
**Beryl:**
Aaaaaaand we got it! Great work, Lady Spinel!
 
**Beryl:**
I knew you had talent as a witch! I never thought you'd be able to master my dear old granny's Curse Arts so easily!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
R-really? I'm happy to hear it, but...
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
That felt REALLY gross just now...I don't want to use that “magecraft” any more...
 
**Beryl:**
Oh don't worry, you won't have to! That was a once-in-a-lifetime secret art!
 
**Beryl:**
(After all, it rots the soul of the one who uses it. Best to let someone else do it for you.)
 
**Beryl:**
Now hand that over, Princess. It's scary how it throbs like that, right?
 
**Beryl:**
Your cute little fingers won't be able to hold onto that forever.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
...Okay. I'm growing fond of the sensation, but here you go.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
But... what is that, exactly? Woodwose's liver, or something?
 
**Beryl:**
Well, something like that.
 
**Beryl:**
You know how back in pan-human history, we had stories about witches who could turn into animals?
 
**Beryl:**
That's a kind of magecraft that can't be performed on a whim because it has so many prerequisites&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
But there are shortcuts to everything. Like this, you get it?
 
**Beryl:**
Gather up parts of the creature you want to become and gobble them up. It's a little gross, but this is the fastest way.
 
## Fragment / 7 
 
**Narration:**
The savior Tonelico, the stubborn Black Knight Ector, and the Fairy Knight Totrot.
 
**Narration:**
And then there was Mash, the marvelous knight with the great shield who arrived from a distant 2,400 years in the future.
 
**Narration:**
This group was headed for the Great Pit, and so they travelled through Britain, where the conflicts between the clans had subsided.
 
**Narration:**
It was the year 400 of the Fairy Calendar. The coronation in Londinium would take place six months from now.
 
**Mash:**
Then, it's not that the savior Tonelico was reborn over and over, you just lived on for a long time?
 
**Tonelico:**
Yes. After cleansing a Calamity, I would hide away in a cave and rest in a “coffin”.
 
**Tonelico:**
Hmm...I've been sleeping for about 20 years this time, I think?
 
**Tonelico:**
So it's really no wonder people think I die after cleansing a Calamity!
 
**Mash:**
Um...why would you do that?
 
**Mash:**
After driving away the Calamity, wouldn't everyone be thankful and welcoming to you?
 
**Tonelico:**
No, they aren't.
 
**Tonelico:**
I am Caster, the one who chants the voice from Paradise. Most of the fairies of Britain hate me.
 
**Tonelico:**
Having cleansed a Calamity, I would be seen as their next cause of disturbance.
 
**Tonelico:**
Therefore, I leave the worldly matters following the Calamity into the hands of the clan heads and go into hibernation.
 
**Mash:**
And, when you say hibernating, you mean like hibernating over winter!? Like, where you barely eat anything and sleep all winter long...!
 
**Tonelico:**
Yes, exactly. I can also replenish the magical energy I used to cleanse the Calamity. Two birds with one stone!
 
**Tonelico:**
But that won't happen this time. Everything in Britain will change when Uther becomes King.
 
**Tonelico:**
This Lostb&mdash;...Britain will no longer be a world where its people kill each other without true purpose.
 
**Tonelico:**
The “Queen's Calendar” that you spoke of is proof of that. The calendar had changed, as did the world.
 
**Mash:**
That's...true.
 
**Mash:**
It's true that Fairy Britain was a world completely ruled by a single fairy, but...
 
**Mash:**
Tonelico, has Britain always been in such a state?
 
**Mash:**
I was told that there had always been conflicts between the clans, but I didn't think it was to this extent...
 
**Tonelico:**
...Britain's land was very limited in space.
 
**Tonelico:**
Nowadays, each of the clans has their own territory, but our land used to be much smaller.
 
**Tonelico:**
The land of Britain is a world formed by piling up the corpses of dead fairies.
 
**Tonelico:**
Fighting and killing was the norm, and every day, thousands and thousands of fairies passed away. Britain has taken its current form because of that.
 
**Tonelico:**
The conflict between clans was a “fight for limited land”, but it was also an act of “creating more land”.
 
**Tonelico:**
Their mutual hostility and hatred made them feel like that they had the right to kill the other fairies.
 
**Tonelico:**
If they hadn't, Britain would have remained narrow and small. That's why...
 
**Tonelico:**
At the very least, I try to prevent all the fairies from being wiped out by a Calamity, while I stay out of the conflict between the clans.
 
**Mash:**
This Britain is an island made from the corpses of fairies...I heard the same from Totrot.
 
**Mash:**
Conflict was necessary to expand their sphere of existence...that may have been the case, but...
 
**Mash:**
Why was the island of Britain “small and narrow” in the first place? In my world, the island of Britain was much bigger.
 
**Mash:**
The only thing I can think of is that there must have been some sort of difference in the past that required the use of fairy corpses.
 
**Tonelico:**
I know...I asked myself the same question. How did the island of Britain come to be like this?
 
**Tonelico:**
But, since I was born 3,600 years ago, or to put it your way, year 4000 of the Fairy Calendar...
 
**Tonelico:**
I was never taught anything about the beginning of Britain, which was 10,000 years ago&ndash;or year 12000 of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Mash:**
12,000 years ago... (That's around the same time as Olympus' divergence point...!)
 
**Mash:**
S-so, there's no history of anything before that? The Fairy Calendar started 12,000 years ago, then!?
 
**Tonelico:**
There's no doubt about that. Orkney's records said the exact same thing.
 
**Tonelico:**
“In the beginning, there was an empty sea. Nothing but six fairies, a priestess, and a beast.”
 
**Black Knight:**
That's wrong. How many times do I have to tell you? If you want to dye it yellow, you need onion skin.
 
**Black Knight:**
In order to prevent color loss, you need salt. Dissolve it in boiling water before applying. I told you this yesterday too.
 
**Black Knight:**
If you don't feel like doing it, then don't bother. You can just tie your enemies up with string.
 
**Totrot:**
...
 
**Totrot:**
...What was it...? What was it...?
 
**Totrot:**
...How do I use the string...? How do I put the cotton to good use...?
 
**Totrot:**
Ugh... uggghhh...uggghhhhhhh...I don't know... I don't knoooow...
 
**Totrot:**
I have to do this right... but why am I always like this...?
 
**Mash:**
Totrot...? Were you asleep?
 
**Totrot:**
What?
 
**Totrot:**
Oh, oh, you're awake too! Go to sleep! Tomorrow is the day we go to the Great Pit!
 
**Totrot:**
I'm on watch duty! I'm totally not practicing or anything!
 
**Mash:**
...? When you say practice...you're practicing to not make a mess with your tools, aren't you?
 
**Totrot:**
&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Ahh, I'm sorry, really! I must have got it all wrong!
 
**Mash:**
Umm, this is...probably...you're sewing something, right!?
 
**Totrot:**
...Exactly. An outfit for Tonelico to wear at the coronation.
 
**Totrot:**
...Tonelico told the people in the city that she didn't need one,
 
**Totrot:**
so that's why I thought I'd make it for her. Sewing with thread is the only thing I'm good at. But...
 
**Totrot:**
...I can't. I've been trying to do it for months, but I just can't.
 
**Totrot:**
Even if I hear something three, or even two days ago...
 
**Totrot:**
I just forget everything so quickly. I can't do anything that I didn't already know from birth.
 
**Totrot:**
The Black Knight says that I can just keep fighting, and that was my role from the beginning...
 
**Totrot:**
...but, ever since I saw the pretty dresses in the city, there's been a pain in my chest.
 
**Totrot:**
For no reason whatsoever, I get sad and want to cry.
 
**Totrot:**
...I get the feeling that something very important is missing from me.
 
**Totrot:**
So...if I could make clothes like a human craftsman, maybe I could learn something regarding that.
 
**Totrot:**
I'm really just an idiot...
 
**Totrot:**
No matter how much others try to teach me, I can only do what I've always done...
 
**Totrot:**
Ughh...ughhhh...I don't know why...I don't know...
 
**Totrot:**
But...I want to try...I want to try, at least...
 
**Totrot:**
I really want to do something other than just fighting... I want to do something different...
 
**Mash:**
Totrot...
 
**Mash:**
Then, what about keeping a diary?
 
**Mash:**
Everyone's a little forgetful sometimes! But, we can use words!
 
**Mash:**
We can write down anything we need as a memo!
 
**Mash:**
To be honest, I'm a diary person too! I can teach you how to use one!
 
**Totrot:**
B-but, I can't even write. And I forget everything...
 
**Mash:**
I can't write the language of fairies either! So let's study together!
 
**Mash:**
Don't worry, even if you forget, your body will remember and you'll write with just muscle memory!
 
**Mash:**
Writing is all about taking what's in your head and putting it down on paper. If you can have a conversation, writing should be no problem!
 
**Mash:**
Without a doubt, it's something you were born knowing!
 
**Mash:**
This is the Great Pit... (So Camelot hasn't been built yet.)
 
**Totrot:**
Tonelico, are you really going to go down there!? I'm against it! I get a bad feeling from this place!
 
**Tonelico:**
But there's no danger. There aren't any Mors around here.
 
**Tonelico:**
The fairies won't come near this place, so we won't get attacked by anti-Londinium organizations.
 
**Tonelico:**
Totrot, you focus on lowering the string, and I'll take care to protect the string with magecraft.
 
**Tonelico:**
We will lower Mash down using the string. As long as she doesn't let go, it'll be fine.
 
**Mash:**
Me!?
 
**Totrot:**
Mash is going down the hole!?
 
**Totrot:**
Then I will go too! If Mash goes alone, she'll get lonely!
 
**Tonelico:**
You're playing the part of the winch, so you have to stay here.
 
**Totrot:**
I see! Then what am I supposed to do!?
 
**Mash:**
I'm surprised by your initiative, Totrot, but I'm fine alone.
 
**Mash:**
I've done things like this many times, like surveying ruins.
 
**Mash:**
I can trust your string. It's like a sturdy wire rope!
 
**Mash:**
I'm going to do my best, so help by keeping me safe, Totrot.
 
**Totrot:**
Of course! You're so brave, Mash!
 
**Tonelico:**
Well then. Over here, Mash.
 
**Tonelico:**
Wrap it once around your waist as a lifeline... make a foothold from the main thread. Yes, that will do.
 
**Tonelico:**
Your voice can transmit through the thread, so call us if there's any danger.
 
**Tonelico:**
If your foot slips from the hold, we (Ector) will hoist the lifeline as hard as he can.
 
**Tonelico:**
My Enchantment can allow Totrot's thread to stretch to 8,000 meters, but we're not necessarily trying to reach all the way down.
 
**Tonelico:**
How deep the Great Pit is, and what might be at the bottom...
 
**Tonelico:**
Please let us know if you come close enough to see.
 
**Tonelico:**
This trip is just for reconnaissance, all right?
 
**Black Knight:**
There's no “justs” about it. You're the only one thinking it'll progress beyond that.
 
**Black Knight:**
I humbly think you should attack at once if you spot anything dangerous.
 
**Black Knight:**
If it weren't for me and Wryneck, your strategies would never succeed.
 
**Totrot:**
The Black Knight is right! I'm finally seeing it since Mash got here!
 
**Totrot:**
You're too reckless, Tonelico! Even against an enemy, there's no blood or tears!
 
**Tonelico:**
Huh~? Aren't I just taking things in stride~?
 
**Tonelico:**
It's true that everyone ends up fawning over me.
 
**Tonelico:**
After all, no matter how tough a fight gets, I always get through it with a smile.
 
**Tonelico:**
I've fallen on a lot of tough times where I started hating myself, but I've made it this far with everyone's help.
 
**Mash:**
I'm going down then. Navigation is up to you, Tonelico.
 
**Mash:**
...One hour since descending...now at 7,000 meters.
 
**Mash:**
...No change in the pit's dimensions...or any sign of life.
 
**Mash:**
...but, I wonder...is this ash? It's rising from the bottom...
 
**Mash:**
(...So the ash in the atmosphere of this Britain's Fairyland has risen from here...)
 
**Mash:**
(...And if there's ash, that means something's burning...)
 
**Mash:**
(Just what is at the bottom...?)
 
**Tonelico:**
Hmm...I didn't expect it to be this deep...
 
**Tonelico:**
Can you see the bottom yet, Mash? I mean, dark as it must be?
 
**Tonelico:**
Are you cold down there?
 
**Mash:**
Yes, the light from above is gone. But the temperature is warm. Only...
 
**Mash:**
(The more I descend, the heavier the air gets...)
 
**Mash:**
(I can breathe thanks to the protection of Heroic Spirit Galahad...)
 
**Mash:**
7,400...7,450...no change in dimensions.
 
**Mash:**
Can you still stretch the line, Tonelico? We'll have to go down much deeper to see whatever's at bottom&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Wait.
 
**Mash:**
Something is in the depths&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
A glowing, red light is&mdash;
 
**Totrot:**
What is that sound!? What is going on, Tonelico!?
 
**Tonelico:**
Mash, take your foot off the catch! The thread's been infected by the lethal amount of magical elements coming up!
 
**Tonelico:**
(It's not just Britain. Is there a curse behind this Lostbelt that's covering the entire planet...!?)
 
**Tonelico:**
That space is not of this world! You'll be drawn in if you gaze on it&mdash;Mash? Mash!?
 
**Tonelico:**
No, she's lost consciousness! Ector, pull as hard as you can!
 
**Tonelico:**
Oh, no&mdash;it's him at the bottom...!
 
**Tonelico:**
Cernunnos!
 
**Tonelico:**
But why!? Why has an ancient Celtic god gone to die in a place like that...!?
 
**Mash:**
Haaaaa&mdash;...!
 
**Totrot:**
Oh, whaaaaa! Mash finally came to, Tonelico!
 
**Totrot:**
You big goof! You had me worried, you goof!
 
**Mash:**
T-Totrot...!? Please calm down...!
 
**Mash:**
The last thing I remember...I was descending into the Great Pit&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
...I'm so sorry, Mash. My presumptions were all wrong.
 
**Tonelico:**
This is the cathedral in Salisbury. We brought you here after you fell unconscious.
 
**Tonelico:**
You had a terrible curse all over your body when we pulled you out of the pit.
 
**Tonelico:**
My magecraft alone couldn't exorcise it, but with the cleansing power of this land and that of the Wind Clan...
 
**Tonelico:**
We finally rid you of the curse.
 
**Mash:**
...I remember...I fainted at the sight of those flames.
 
**Mash:**
Thank you for helping me, Tonelico.
 
**Mash:**
I'm just sorry for the inconvenience brought about by the bad judgement on my part.
 
**Mash:**
So...about the fire at the bottom...?
 
**Tonelico:**
We can talk about that later.
 
**Tonelico:**
It's a bit of an issue...that might take a couple centuries to fix, never mind decades.
 
**Tonelico:**
Just knowing that such a thing is lurking at the bottom of the Great Pit is fortuitous.
 
**Tonelico:**
Thank you for your cooperation. From here on out, after Britain is unified...
 
**Tonelico:**
I'll be consulting with Uther on how to deal with the Great Pit.
 
**Totrot:**
There you go again, Tonelico! Mash could've died down there!
 
**Tonelico:**
But leaving that aside...there's no thanks or anything I can offer you...
 
**Tonelico:**
I didn't learn any magecraft that could return you to the future, or anything of the sort...
 
**Mash:**
No, please don't worry about it. I was also interested in the Great Pit.
 
**Mash:**
In the Fairy Kingdom, everybody took its presence for granted.
 
**Mash:**
But no matter how you look at it, having a giant hole in the center of your island is a bizarre situation.
 
**Mash:**
So I was wondering why nobody had investigated it.
 
**Totrot:**
So the Great Pit is still there in the future! It can't be plugged up!?
 
**Tonelico:**
Hmm, so it's that deep...maybe it's truly bottomless...
 
**Tonelico:**
It can't exactly be sealed like the Spear of Selection.
 
**Tonelico:**
I guess we'll have to wait and see for a while...
 
**Mash:**
Hm? By Spear of Selection, do you mean the Staff of Selection?
 
**Mash:**
I've been meaning to ask, Tonelico. You're the Savior, but you don't have the Staff of Selection with you.
 
**Mash:**
Did you lose it somewhere?
 
**Tonelico:**
Well, I don't know about any Staff of Selection, but the Spear of Selection is no longer in my possession.
 
**Tonelico:**
I came to Britain along with the Ritual Tools of Selection from my homeland that washed ashore with me.
 
**Tonelico:**
That one became corrupted by my feelings and turned into a “weapon gone bad”.
 
**Tonelico:**
So I sealed it and was given leave to store it in this cathedral.
 
**Totrot:**
It's a real shame, though!
 
**Totrot:**
The Garden and the Spear are Tonelico's super moves!
 
**Totrot:**
The Garden is a Bounded Field used to lock up incubi, and the Spear is a weapon for punishing fairies!
 
**Totrot:**
But the last time we had a Calamity, the fairies acted so selfishly.
 
**Totrot:**
Tonelico flipped her lid, and the Spear inverted!
 
**Mash:**
...If you don't mind my asking, what became “bad” about it?
 
**Tonelico:**
...Hmm, how do I say it...the spear's strength itself didn't change, but...
 
**Tonelico:**
It's like a limiter popped off and made the charging function all wonky...
 
**Tonelico:**
To put it frankly...
 
**Tonelico:**
The Spear of Selection doesn't draw from a wielder's magic energy, but their lifespan.
 
## Section 16: Gloucester (II) 
 
**Percival:**
Good morning, everyone.
 
**Percival:**
I'm sure you're all still tired from the battle yesterday, but there's a reason I've gathered you here so early in the morning.
 
**Percival:**
You see...last night, Artoria and Fujimaru received an invitation to a fairy ball, or the “Faerium”.
 
**Percival:**
The invitation was sent by Lady Muryan of Gloucester.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An invitation to a fairy ball?|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
More importantly, Percival, your body...
 
**Percival:**
Yes, some of my hair has changed color, but rest assured, there are no other changes.
 
**Percival:**
It has a nice stylish look about it, too.
 
**Percival:**
I'd secretly been admiring the Count's own look, so I'm actually rather happy with it.
 
**Percival:**
...ah, sorry, my inner thoughts slipped out. How embarrassing, it's time for me to grow up.
 
**Percival:**
Sorry. Back on topic, the invitation from Lady Muryan.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
The timing on this...you're definitely up to no good, aren't you, Muryan?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Regardless, what's this “Faerium” anyway? Can someone give me a little context here?
 
**Gareth:**
Let me, Gareth, who has always desired to attend a ball, explain it to you!
 
**Gareth:**
The Fairy Ball, the Faerium! The soirée that fairies all around Britain yearn for!
 
**Gareth:**
Not only the clan heads, but other prominent fairies recognized for their service that year to the Fairy Kingdom are invited to speak at this evening of laudation.
 
**Gareth:**
There are sights never before seen, food never before eaten, dances to music never before heard...
 
**Gareth:**
It's also the pinnacle of high society, where the most “dazzling” fairy of the year is chosen.
 
**Gareth:**
Right, Artoria!? There isn't a fairy around who doesn't long for an invitation to the Faerium!
 
**Artoria:**
Y-yeah, right. I guess so? I've been longing for it too, haven't I?
 
**Artoria:**
But you know, with the way everything is going at the moment, is it really a good idea for us to be going...?
 
**Artoria:**
I really can't say anything good comes to mind when I think about it either...!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, we're going to Gloucester!?|
 
**Count Peperon:**
Indeed. Such a blatant invitation is a chance for us to turn the tables.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Is that your plan, Muryan, my dear? It's so terribly kind of you to offer up Gloucester's bell like this, you know?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You know, this is our chance to ring another bell!
 
**Da Vinci:**
In all likelihood, that's probably what Muryan is intending to happen by inviting Artoria.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Muryan is giving us an opportunity. What her end goal is, however, I'm not sure.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Right. This is likely Muryan's own way of expressing her support for both the Queen and the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Oberon:**
It's only natural that the head of Gloucester should be the one to hold a ball. Even more so when it's the historic fairy ball Faerium.
 
**Oberon:**
Of course, Artoria and Fujimaru aren't the only ones invited.
 
**Oberon:**
Morgan...she'll never leave her throne, but others may come in her stead.
 
**Oberon:**
Fairy Knight Tristan. And of course, Lancelot. There's no reason why we shouldn't see them there.
 
**Gareth:**
Right? Especially since Lancelot is chosen every single year...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...That bastard.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I'd love to return the favor, but Gloucester is under Muryan's Rule.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Neither side will be able to wage war against each other at the ball, I guess.
 
**Oberon:**
That's right. It makes this an even greater opportunity.
 
**Oberon:**
We, who rang the bells and defeated Woodwose, are considered traitors, and would be forbidden from entering Gloucester.
 
**Oberon:**
But this will be different. We'll be attending the ball as guests of nobility.
 
**Oberon:**
And what follows should be obvious, no?
 
**Oberon:**
Sneaking out of silly old-fashioned ceremonies and into secret rooms is what Artoria does best, right?
 
**Artoria:**
I knew that's what it was gonna come down to!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You'll bust out some shady magecraft this time for sure, right?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Don't call it that!
 
**Percival:**
Then it's settled. I'll have a carriage prepared for you right away.
 
**Percival:**
After all, the ball is tonight! Let's do our best to reach Gloucester by nightfall!
 
**Everyone else:**
Muryan, isn't this a little short notice!?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Oberon:**
Phew, we made it. Gloucester, we meet once again.
 
**Oberon:**
Red Rab-bit and Percival have been left to stand guard outside the city...
 
**Oberon:**
...and, to make matters worse, there were only two invitations, one for Artoria, and one for Fujimaru.
 
**Oberon:**
Each invitation allows for just one extra companion. I wonder what's with that...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Myself and Da Vinci will do. I've already met Muryan.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Gloucester is a battleground of words, not weapons, so having Oberon with us would be a great help...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, Oberon? You'll be able to sneak in without any issue, won't you?
 
**Oberon:**
Naturally. I'm glad that we're on the same page, Muramasa.
 
**Oberon:**
I've got a bit of a thing going with some ladies here in Gloucester. I'll sneak in as one of their companions.
 
**Habetrot:**
Well, break a leg, everyone. I'll just be taking a stroll through town.
 
**Gareth:**
I'm Gareth, and I'm disappointed now that I've realised I can't go to the ball...
 
**Gareth:**
Then again, I've changed my mind! Habenyan, let's go to the Count's shop!
 
**Gareth:**
When we left Londinium, he gave us a reference letter to allow our entry!
 
**Gareth:**
“I hope you two have a ball,” Count Peperon said. He's too clever by half!
 
**Habetrot:**
Ah, the Count's store... I suppose I miiiiight be a little bit interested...
 
**Habetrot:**
All right, let's go!
 
**Habetrot:**
I don't want to have too much fun, but that much will be just fine!
 
**Oberon:**
Mmm, friendship really is a thing of beauty. Now then,
 
**Oberon:**
someone's completely frozen on the spot. What do we do, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Muramasa, we'll have to carry her in by force.|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It can't be helped. You on the right, me on the left.
 
**Artoria:**
Uwaaa&mdash;! I knew it&mdash;!
 
**Artoria:**
There's no WAY I'm going to the ball dressed like this! And I don't want to meet anyone I know either, absoluuutely not!
 
**Artoria:**
Oberon, you're a prince, you go! Go and ring the bell too!
 
**Artoria:**
And don't forget to bring me back some of Gloucester's finest cuisine while you're at it!
 
**Oberon:**
Don't say such selfish things! A child who says things like that is not a “Child of Prophecy”!
 
**Oberon:**
There are some Fresh Blood Demonesses in this world who would just LOVE to go but can't! You should be ashamed!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon...you're sounding like her stepmother...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know, maybe you're going a little overboard here...
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
...Yeah, I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting Artoria to have this much loathing towards the ball...
 
**Oberon:**
Maybe she has some kind of underlying trauma? Were you mistaken for a waiter at a ball once?
 
**Artoria:**
C-could something that miserable ever have happened in the past!?
 
**Artoria:**
But you see, I'm already the face of the Round Table Army...to show up wearing something so shabby, it's just...
 
**Oberon:**
In that case, there's even less to worry about. For a warrior, their combat attire is their formal attire.
 
**Oberon:**
Or would you rather Fujimaru headed in first?
 
**Oberon:**
It might be difficult for you to rejoin us once you're inside. You'd be attending the ball with Muramasa as your partner.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right then, let's go.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That shouldn't be a problem, right?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
W-wait a moment, I'm going, I'm goiiiiiiing! Don't leave me behiiiiiind&mdash;!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Amazing...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So pretty...
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, this is terrific. Who knew there was a place as amazing as this right next to the auction house?
 
**Da Vinci:**
A Fairy Territory within a Fairy Territory...truly the mark of an Alien Common Sense, an ultra first-class Reality Marble.
 
**Da Vinci:**
After all, the size of the building as seen from the outside and the size of this hall on the inside don't match.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's quite the accomplishment. Muryan is second to none when it comes to building this sort of stuff, isn't she?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's so spectacular that even Artoria is beginning to calm down...
 
**Artoria:**
This is the second time I've been here. It's not like I'm going to be standing here in silence, captivated by my surroundings.
 
**Artoria:**
So then, where's Muryan? She invited us here and doesn't even have the damn common courtesy to say hello...
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Artoria is getting worked up again...we can always count on her to take the offensive, can't we?)
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, that's more like it. I don't see that bastard Muryan anywhere, do you?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You'd think her first move would be unveiling the “Child of Prophecy” to get the crowd going, but&mdash;oh?
 
**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Ladies and gentlemen. Please excuse my interruption.
 
**Auctioneer Fairy:**
The owner of this establishment, Muryan, has yet to make her appearance. Please accept my sincerest apologies for the delay.
 
**Auctioneer Fairy:**
Today's special announcement will be revealed in one hour from now. In the meantime, please enjoy the atmosphere.
 
**Artoria:**
...I don't think Muryan is anywhere in the ballroom. Oberon doesn't seem to have arrived either...
 
**Artoria:**
What do we do, Fujimaru? Should we sneak into the bell tower already?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, we could...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I mean, we've come all this way...
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh? It seems new guests have arrived. Wow, everyone's making way for them&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whaaaa&mdash;?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Baaaaaa&mdash;?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Seriously?
 
**Da Vinci:**
My my～♪
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, oh. Who was that, the girl next to Aurora?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Aurora's beauty is remarkable, but the fairy next to her is also...well, she's very pretty, isn't she?
 
**Artoria:**
...Huh. Muramasa's into that kind of “lady-like” appearance, then.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No, it's not that I like it or hate it, but I'm allowed to give an objective opinion, you know?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Beryl! And Fairy Knight Tristan!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, of course she'd come. As Morgan's daughter, it's to be expected.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(...Damn it. Muryan, is this your plan? You're so damn vindictive...)
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(Or are you just a perfectionist? Setting up all her opposition for a single chance to take each other out...)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...The buzz seems to have settled.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Is this the last of the arrivals?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you looking for someone?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
N-no, it's nothing. I was just wondering if Knocknarea was here.
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, thank goodness she isn't! I don't have to put up with her arrogant attitude or listen to her snide remarks!
 
**Coral:**
Good evening, Child of Prophecy. Congratulations on your victory in Londinium.
 
**Artoria:**
C-Coral! Sorry, was I too loud!?
 
**Artoria:**
You see, I'm not really used to this sort of situation, I'm sorry for acting like a country fairy bumpkin...
 
**Artoria:**
A-a-anyway, thank you for your polite greeting!
 
**Coral:**
Fufu. I know how you feel, but you don't have to be so nervous.
 
**Coral:**
This hall is under the effect of Muryan's magic. As such, one cannot see the face of someone they don't know.
 
**Coral:**
You don't have to worry about a stranger seeing your face here. There is no need to be so tense.
 
**Coral:**
Evenings like these are a rarity. I hope you will take the time to enjoy yourself.
 
**Artoria:**
I-is that so? C-Coral, so you can be like this too...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's a lot more fun here than in Salisbury, isn't it?|
 

---

 
**Coral:**
No, as Aurora's bodyguard, I mustn't allow myself to get carried away.
 
**Coral:**
Foreign Magus. Do not forget that despite being invited here, you are still a human.
 
**Coral:**
Do not speak your opinions so carelessly, as you have been doing. Know your place.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Thanks for the heads-up. Deep down, a part of you is always worried about the humans, right?
 
**Da Vinci:**
You were just giving {(M)him/(F)her} a warning to stay out of trouble by not doing the same to other fairies.
 
**Coral:**
I have no such intentions. Presumptuous interpretations are a bother.
 
**Coral:**
I am not like Lady Aurora. I don't like humans, and I don't consider them to be my equals.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Really?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Aurora, who lets humans live freely; and you, who imposes strict discipline.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It appears to me that you're a lot kinder to humans than I originally thought&mdash;
 
**Coral:**
Silence. No matter what clan you hail from or which fairy you are, such slander against Lady Aurora is an insult to the Wind Clan.
 
**Coral:**
Moreover&mdash;comparing me to Lady Aurora is just unacceptable.
 
**Coral:**
I was foolish enough to try and work with the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Coral:**
This is a soirée for distinguished guests. You should learn civility before you come.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's a little rude. Ah, but could I ask you one more question?
 
**Da Vinci:**
That fairy who was standing next to Aurora earlier&mdash;is she Aurora's bodyguard?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I mean, aside from you, Aurora's right-hand fairy.
 
**Coral:**
...
 
**Coral:**
The most beautiful fairy stands next to the most brilliant fairy, Lady Aurora.
 
**Coral:**
When she is present, I respectfully give up my seat.
 
**Coral:**
...That is the way of things. Even if she is a repulsive​ creature who crawled out of the black mud.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...and off she goes...|
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I'm not sure who's to blame for that. What's the matter, Da Vinci? That wasn't like you.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That was a tough one, wasn't it, Da Vinci?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm, better luck next time.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I've always wondered about the difference in values between Coral and Aurora.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I had hoped to use this opportunity to get to the bottom of that, but I guess I overdid it a little☆
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
A difference in values?
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**???:**
What did you say to Coral? She seemed very upset about it.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You...the one who was next to Aurora...|
 

---

 
**???:**
...? Oh, right. I'm not wearing my armor today. Excuse me.
 
**I：???:**
I've seen you all a few times now. It's not as if we've never met before, but it's the first time I've given my name.
 
**I：???:**
I'm Lancelot, the Fairy Knight.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Welcome to the ball, Artoria, Fujimaru.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
And who is the young lady over there? Do you mind if I ask your name?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Y-yes, of course! I'm Leonardo da Vinci. N-nice to meet you, right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Da Vinci!?)|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
(Don't blame me, I was an artist before I was Chaldea's technical advisor! Beautiful things are my weakness!)
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...You're surprisingly soft-spoken tonight, aren't you? Is your sheep's clothing all zipped up?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...Who are you? Do I know you?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I'm the man you threw out of the castle! You stabbed me over and over and you don't remember any of it!?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Oh! Oh, of course, Muramasa! Sorry, I never saw your face or anything!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But cutting you down felt amazing, it left such a strong impression on me!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Yes, I knew you'd be alive! I had the feeling we'd be able to fight again!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
So, when's the rematch!? Will you slice my head off next time!?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It's going to be so much fun! I'm going to gouge out that patchwork Spirit Core of yours like driving in a stake!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Y-yeah. (What's with this girl...she's got the same air about her as Oberon!?)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(She's a prince-type, all right! There's no doubting the power of Lancelot's gifted name!)
 
**Artoria:**
Umm...I don't suppose you're...from Avalon&ndash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...Well, that is that. Aurora told me to keep a low profile about my origin.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Well done on your victory in Londinium. Even though we are enemies, I commend you for your good fight.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...One more thing. I'd like to ask you something.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I need to know if anything has happened to Percival. I'm told he's not dead, but...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...is he in good health? Nothing bad has happened to him, right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's fine, but...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Who is Percival to you?|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
He's my little brother.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see, you're his sister! I'm sure you're awfully worried about hi&mdash;wait...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
PERCIVAL'S SISTER!?|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
Fairy Knight Lancelot...
 
**Artoria:**
She just told us that she was Percival's older sister and then left...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The type to say whatever's on her mind.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The strongest fairy and human are siblings!?
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Percival never even hinted at any such thing.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I don't think he was hiding it. More the fact that it never came up in a conversation.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Is this something generally known in Britain, Artoria?
 
**Artoria:**
No, not at all. I don't think anyone would believe it if you told them.
 
**Artoria:**
Lancelot herself told us, so I don't think we have any choice but to believe it.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...In that case, I guess Percival wants to keep it a secret.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
If word got out that their commander was Lancelot's brother, you can imagine how it would affect the morale of the Round Table Army.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But that airheaded Fairy Knight just blurted it out and exposed the secret...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What's with that? Aren't all the Fairy Knights a bit too free-spoken?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The thing is...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
It's not really a problem. I think you should just keep shut about it.
 
**Artoria:**
This isn't as though the two are in cahoots, and they wouldn't be meddling in each other's affairs.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
S-sure, if it's all the same to you, I'll keep quiet about it...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Percival's a human, and Lancelot's a fairy, right? How can they be siblings?
 
**Artoria:**
It's not unheard of for fairies to “adopt” humans.
 
**Artoria:**
Maybe Lancelot was an old friend of the fairy who took in Percival.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...That sounds plausible. It's probably why he didn't want to go anywhere near Salisbury...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Da Vinci?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Could it be that the fairy who took in Percival was...)

---

 
**Invited Fairy:**
Oh, there's the human {(M)boy/(F)girl}. Yeah, you. Come here.
 
**Invited Fairy:**
The Fairy Knight says she wants a word. Hurry up and head over to the terrace. Don't make her wait.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She called for me?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, you're the only human in this hall, Fujimaru.
 
**Da Vinci:**
What do you think? Will you go?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
As long as you guys join me.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Naturally. Even with Muryan's Rule in effect, this is still enemy territory.
 
**Artoria:**
The terrace is reserved for private use, so no other fairies will be coming. It's great for secret talks.
 
**Artoria:**
Lancelot left rather suddenly after the big reveal, so maybe she still has other questions to ask.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No objections here. To be honest with you, I'd like to have observed her a little longer.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The clothes, I mean, obviously her clothes. There might be some references there to tie things up with.
 
**Artoria:**
Gag.
 
**Barghest:**
It was good of you to accept an enemy's invitation... Not that I doubted you wouldn't.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fairy Knight Gawain!|
 
**Barghest:**
I can't use that name anymore. Barghest is fine.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That dress looks good on you.
 
**Barghest:**
...Of course it does. I am a lord. I'm not so barbaric that I would wear my armor to a formal event.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Good evening, Barghest. It's been some time since the forest in Wales.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Since then, we haven't known if you were punished or not.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If we're going to talk, perhaps you could explain that first?
 
**Barghest:**
...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Barghest? Will you only speak to Fujimaru?
 
**Barghest:**
No, that's not...
 
**Artoria:**
That's not it. She's just fascinated by you, Da Vinci.
 
**Artoria:**
Come on, Barghest, if you've got something to say, spit it out! We're on a schedule here!
 
**Barghest:**
I know. I don't have time either. I'll make this brief.
 
**Barghest:**
Da Vinci, as you said, I have been relieved of my post as a guardian of Britain.
 
**Barghest:**
I'm under house arrest within my own land. At this time, I have no reason to attack the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Barghest:**
I didn't feel like making an appearance at this ball either, but I guessed you would be here.
 
**Barghest:**
So I swallowed my pride and came to talk to you. &mdash;Is that enough of an explanation?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, that works. I didn't mean anything by it, but I just had to be sure, you know?
 
**Barghest:**
Don't worry about it. It's an understandable question. You're the foreign magus' adjutant, after all.
 
**Barghest:**
...Now I have a question for you.
 
**Barghest:**
I'd like for you to tell me of the outside world... of pan-human history. As much as you can.
 
**Barghest:**
Her Majesty has told me what is necessary, but I know none of its inner workings nor its history.
 
**Barghest:**
Are you merciless arbitrators? Savage invaders? Or are you&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
Are you harmless visitors, here to learn about our own history?
 
**Da Vinci:**
...That's all. It was a bit of a rush job, but I explained as much as I could.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We've conquered Lostbelts in order to reclaim our history and our future.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We're not targeting Britain for attack, but in the end, as a Lostbelt it will have to be “pruned.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
However, that doesn't mean we deny the history of the Lostbelt itself, or the people living in it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Lostbelts and pan-human history may be embroiled in struggle for survival where only one can survive,
 
**Da Vinci:**
but that is world versus world, not people versus people.
 
**Barghest:**
You think that too, don't you, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(nod in approval)|
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
...I see. You're an honest one, aren't you?
 
**Barghest:**
On that note, I'd like to ask, do fairies exist in pan-human history as well?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes. The conditions may be harsh, but in pan-human history, fairies still live and breathe in Britain's forests to the present day.
 
**Da Vinci:**
In Ireland and the Isle of Skye, and across the sea in France.
 
**Barghest:**
Ire...Sky...Fra...? W-well, I'll ask you about those places some other time, but...
 
**Barghest:**
Are there no such things as Calamities? They don't have to live in fear of being cursed by Mors?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. Those don't exist.|
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
...What a peaceful world. I envy those fairies.
 
**Barghest:**
...Well. Then...what if...
 
**Barghest:**
...if we&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
...No. Nevermind. That would be too good to be true.
 
**Barghest:**
I've heard everything I've wanted to. I apologize for taking up your time.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 
**Da Vinci:**
What? You were wondering if such a thing was possible? You want to talk about the possibility of emigrating to pan-human history?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You could go there, Barghest.
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
!
 
**Barghest:**
...How did you know? I didn't think that would be an idea to come from you.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We understand. After talking to you, you probably feel the same way as Fujimaru.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Barghest. You care more about protecting the fairies than you do about protecting Britain itself.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You serve Morgan because she protects Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But if she doesn't want to protect the fairies, you have to find another way.
 
**Da Vinci:**
As one of them, it's only natural to think of emigration to a peaceful land&mdash;to pan-human history.
 
**Barghest:**
...But that's impossible. Residents of a Lostbelt can't live outside of one.
 
**Barghest:**
The fairies of this land have no choice but to be consumed as Morgan's tools.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's been true in the Lostbelts up 'til now. But not with Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You can live in pan-human history too. The possibility is there, Barghest.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There are a few major hurdles to that though.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But that's all something we can discuss.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We only need kind-hearted fairies such as you and Artoria to unite all fairies.
 
**Barghest:**
...I see...I'll have to steel my resolve as well.
 
**Barghest:**
Da Vinci. Fujimaru.
 
**Barghest:**
I'd like you two to visit my estate in Manchester at some point. I have a proposal for you.
 
**Barghest:**
...If I lack your trust, that's fine. What you've told me is more than enough.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Oberon:**
About time, I finally got in! That was Barghest just now, wasn't it...?
 
**Oberon:**
She had a very serious air about her...did you challenge her to a duel?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not quite...|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
...I see, emigration... I hadn't really considered the possibility, but...
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, it's such a grand idea to put forward... As big as Barghest herself! It's worth considering!
 
**Oberon:**
I wish I could've been there. So? What did you guys say?
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's as far as the conversation went. It's a rather dangerous topic, after all. We couldn't discuss it any further here.
 
**Da Vinci:**
She asked us to meet her in Manchester. What do you think, Oberon?
 
**Oberon:**
Manchester...that's a little scary...
 
**Oberon:**
Barghest's territory abides by the rule of survival of the fittest. The weak are fodder for the strong.
 
**Oberon:**
I'm not talking about the laws of nature. They all truly believe that from the bottom of their hearts.
 
**Oberon:**
The weak offer themselves to the strong. And the strong exploit the weak as a matter of fact.
 
**Oberon:**
Even the thought of 'resisting because you don't want to die' is futile.
 
**Oberon:**
...Gloucester is a Fairy Territory where the weak can stand on equal footing with the strong.
 
**Oberon:**
But Manchester is one where the strong are free to do as they please.
 
**Oberon:**
I don't mind you going if there's a guarantee that Barghest will not lay a hand on you.
 
**Artoria:**
...Hmm...Bageko wasn't hostile, but for the record, she is a carnivore......
 
**Artoria:**
Like, if she decides, 'alright, I'm going to eat you' in the spur of the moment, we'll get eaten?
 
**Oberon:**
More or less. You know how the anecdote of the Black Dog Lord goes, right?
 
**Oberon:**
Barghest had many lovers, yet not a single one of them lasted long.
 
**Oberon:**
Apparently, she eats them alive a day after inviting them into her mansion.
 
**Oberon:**
Barghest, the Black Dog, is known throughout Britain as the one who feeds on fairies.
 
**Oberon:**
She's trying, within reason, to act like an upper-class fairy. But she always ends up caving to her carnivorous nature.
 
**Oberon:**
She isn't known as the Fairy Eater for nothing. I can't just let you go on your own.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So she's known as the Black Dog Lord. I believe Mike also mentioned that.
 
**Da Vinci:**
“Gawain the affectionate, Gawain the gluttonous.   Constantly ravenous, finding love only to consume,”  he said.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...She didn't seem that frivolous to me. Well, not like I know much about a fairy's habits, though.
 
**Oberon:**
Enough about Barghest. We have our own agenda.
 
**Oberon:**
The bell tower is just around the corner. We can sneak in from this terrace.
 
**Oberon:**
Let's wrap this up before the ball ends. Are you ready, Artoria?
 
**Artoria:**
...Oh, well. Yeah, I'm not so nervous anymore after all that.
 
**Artoria:**
Let's go ring the third bell, Fujimaru!
 
**Oberon:**
But emigration is a bold move. You really are thinking big, Barghest.
 
**Oberon:**
Even though you burned down the forest of Wales.
 
**Narration:**
~Bell Tower, 3rd floor~
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(She finally busted out Merlin's magecraft.)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Alright, no trace of magical energy being used.)
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(That's some lock-picking alright. Not bad, Artoria. You're just like Nezumi Kozou or Jiraiya.)
 
**Artoria:**
(Somehow, I don't feel like that's a compliment. Who are they, fairies from pan-human history?)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Speaking of which, I've heard of fairies who play pranks but I've never heard about fairies who steal money.)
 
**Oberon:**
(I mean, fairies have no need for that. It's just Morgan who went and created a monetary system.)
 
**Oberon:**
(Lock-picking techniques blossomed as a result of safes being made to store savings and assets.)
 
**Oberon:**
(It's hard to open something made with human technology using just a fairy's Sacraments. As a result, lock-picking came into play.)
 
**Artoria:**
(Merlin also said that. He told me to learn it because it'd be useful on my journey.)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Did he really?)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(By the way, I haven't asked you about Merlin yet.)
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
(Artoria, you said you learned magecraft from Merlin. Did he use to live in Tintagel?)
 
**Artoria:**
(I've never actually met him before. I just heard his voice whenever I was alone.)
 
**Artoria:**
(“The scary queen has me imprisoned so I can't come meet you. If you're fine with distance learning, I will teach you.”)
 
**Artoria:**
(And with that, he taught me the basics of magecraft. I somehow managed to improve on my own.)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(I see...the Artoria of pan-human history was trained as a knight by her adoptive father during her waking hours.)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(While Merlin reared her as a king in her sleep, or so it's said...)
 
**Oberon:**
(Yeah, that much is true here as well.)
 
**Oberon:**
(...Hmm? Hold on, isn't it oddly noisy in here?)
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
The Faerium is just a surface level distraction. Dazzling as it may be, it's still just child's play.
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
This is Gloucester, city of trends, brands and pleasure. It's not complete without thrill and ruin, excitement and tragedy&mdash;
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
We have a very special stage prepared for you.
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
A battle that will determine the very future of Britain. An audition to decide the true queen.
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
Now let us start the main event, dripping with scorn and envy!
 
**Artoria:**
Woah!? T-there are a bunch of masked fairies around us!?
 
**Oberon:**
&mdash;As I thought. I figured this would happen, Muryan!
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
Once more, allow me to introduce you.
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
The splendid man and gorgeous girl on the stage, the royal pair, the pride of our Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
Her Majesty's beloved daughter, Fairy Knight Tristan. And the man who has been made Her Majesty's fiancé, Lord Beryl Gut!
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
In the other corner, basking in attention, is the wind of revolution. The savior of Britain that Ainsel sang of.
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
Artoria, the Child of Prophecy. And the Foreign Magus, Master Fujimaru!
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
The feud between Tristan and Artoria began right here.
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
And I hear Lord Beryl and Master Fujimaru share an even deeper connection.
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
There can be no match-up more appropriate than this. Now, please take the stage!
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
Should you best Fairy Knight Tristan, the bell of Gloucester shall acknowledge you, even if I don't.
 
**Masked Fairies:**
How brilliant, as expected of Lady Muryan! You always live up to our expectations!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
Lady Tristan is serious! That is her time-honored “battle fairy”-form! I know it well!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
Oh my...Beryl Gut...even though I've seen him countless times before...for some reason...he's still so... dreamy...
 
**Masked Fairies:**
Those supple, yet sturdy limbs...like those of a first-rate dancer...
 
**Masked Fairies:**
The Child of Prophecy is also bound to have a magnificent figure! After all, we're talking about the fairy who defeated Lord Woodwose!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
Show us the figure worthy of leading Britain!

**Fujimaru 1:**
The way things are going&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh no, Artoria...
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
She's quietly trying to slip away! There's no choice but to get up on stage! Give it up!
 
**Artoria:**
No, let go of meeee! I can't, I really can't! Give up on me!
 
**Oberon:**
That's it, let's kick her onto the stage. Once she's on it, it's all the same.
 
**Artoria:**
OBERON!!!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Damn it...! (I get how Artoria feels...!)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What should we do, Muramasa!?
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Muryan! Where's the dresser? There's got to be one, since this is a stage!
 
**Muryan's Voice:**
Oh my, I'm glad to see you're still alive, Muramasa. There is a dresser backstage...what's the matter?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Okay. Give me a moment here.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Fujimaru, come here for a sec.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?|
 

---

 
**Beryl:**
What? Are they bowing out? After all this setup, they're not even going to fight?
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I mean, of course they'd flee!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
This won't end like last time, after all.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's not magecraft-only, I came dressed for the occasion, and I have you with me, Beryl.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's a shame I won't be able to cut off those cheeky lips of hers, but seeing them flee already makes me feel better.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
I even pity them!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
It's laughable how she's still just a lowly fairy, both inside and out, even though she's been propped up as the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
You won't find someone more pathetic in all of Britain!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I wonder&mdash;|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
about that!|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
You!
 
**Beryl:**
!?
 
**Artoria:**
05:51, 19 December 2021 (EST)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria, your face, your face!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's get this over with!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
T-that's right...deep breaths, deep breaths...
 
**Artoria:**
That's a lot of mouthing off you've done, Tristan! What's with that lewd getup!?
 
**Artoria:**
I am Artoria, the Child of Prophecy! In the name of Caster, the one who chants, I have come to ring the Pilgrim's Bell.
 
**Artoria:**
I will not hold back if you get in my way! I will smite that haughty pride of yours along with those expensive heels!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Huh, big words for a bumpkin fairy. I'll at least praise you for knowing the value of these heels.
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
But if you get too cocky, it'll just make your defeat sting more, you know? My sympathies, but I won't be hearing any pleas for your life, okay?
 
**Artoria:**
Ehh? Wow, she actually thinks she's stronger. That's harsh.
 
**Artoria:**
I'll tell you right now. I have no sympathy for you.
 
**Artoria:**
You're used to running back to your castle in tears, aren't you? And this will be your second time!
 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Not going to happen! I'll tear you limb from limb!
 
**Beryl:**
I'll be damned, did Tristan just get verbally flattened? As expected, someone with a chip on their shoulder can be tough.
 
**Beryl:**
We're finally in a tag-team battle. I actually wanted to have a nice chat with you...
 
**Beryl:**
But I'm going to have to commit. After all, this is my first battle as a Master.
 
**Beryl:**
And my opponent's a veteran Master who's overcome countless predicaments.
 
**Beryl:**
I guess I've got something to prove with a challenge. Let's kill one another with a smile, kouhai.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes! The bell rang!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Artoria wins!
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Tristan:**
Aaah, ahhhh......!
 
**???:**
Coming off...it's coming off...wait...stop...Mother's going to scold me again...!
 
**???:**
“Why are you like that?” “Why are you always like that?”  I'm going to get scolded...!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
The Fairy Knight has fallen! Another knight falls after Barghest! Excellent!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
Ainsel's prophecy held true after all...we should all bet on the Child of Prophecy from now on!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
But Tristan...I feel like I've seen that fairy before somewhere...
 
**Masked Fairies:**
Oh! I know, I know! No doubt about it, it's her!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
I saw her 100 years ago at Greymalkin's mansion!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
Her real name is Baobhan Sith! Darlington's maidservant, the vampire Baobhan Sith!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
A vampire, you say...!? What is Her Majesty even thinking!?
 
**Masked Fairies:**
Oh dear, to think she's been feeding on human blood...! No wonder she stinks, she reeks of sewage!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
How many humans has she sold her body to, I wonder!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
Her resurrection 100 years ago! Darlington turned into a sea of corpses!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
She's the reason Darlington fell, and the reason Greymalkin became a Fairy Deadlord!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
There's no doubt about it, she and Morgan are responsible! Damn vampire, you alone survived. How dare you!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Ahh...ahhh...no, that's wrong...I...I&mdash;
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Stop, stop it...! Don't badmouth my mother, she did nothing wrong!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
What's wrong with sucking blood from a corpse! What's so wrong about the living dead!?
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
How did Darlington turn into a sea of corpses? Hell if I know!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
She ran! She fled! Baobhan Sith has fled!
 
**Masked Fairies:**
I knew it, the queen is mad! Choosing a lowly fairy like that as her successor!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Things have gotten heated...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I can't really say I'm happy about this...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
You can say that again... Everyone's a liar. In the end, that's all it amounts to.
 
**Beryl:**
My goodness, I've lost! You really are strong, Fujimaru!
 
**Beryl:**
Looks like I can't beat you as a Master anymore.
 
**Beryl:**
So, what'll it be? Will you have the lady over there kill me?
 
**Beryl:**
Or would you rather finish it with your own hands? As you can see, I'm unarmed.
 
**Beryl:**
My bodyguard, Baobhan Sith, has also fled. Without a doubt, this is the perfect opportunity, no?
 
**Artoria:**
...Fujimaru...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is Gloucester. We can't fight.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(...I can't take his word for it. He's got something else up his sleeve...)
 

---

 
**Beryl:**
...Is that so? I thought this would be the end, but I guess not.
 
**Beryl:**
Man, you're better than Kadoc when it comes to sniffing out danger! You're looking more and more reliable!
 
**Beryl:**
Well, I'll take you up on that and take my leave then.
 
**Beryl:**
As long as Mash isn't around, there's no point in playing with you.
 
**Beryl:**
See you later, savior and companions! I'll be seeing you in Camelot!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Muryan:**
Kyaaa~☆ Thank you all for coming~! I'm glad everyone enjoyed themselves~!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Really? You're the only one here who had fun.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That was a tedious show you put on. To think I had to pull out my trump card for that mess...
 
**Muryan:**
Oh? What might you be talking about? Were you in the fight, Muramasa?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Whatever, shut up.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(...Damn it. I was hoping to save it for Camelot.)
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
By the way, Fujimaru, thank you very much for this outfit.
 
**Artoria:**
You've been preparing this for a while, haven't you? In secret.
 
**Artoria:**
Aw, did you say nothing because you were embarrassed? You're so thoughtful, you know!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, actually...|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
&mdash; (※silent pressure to not say anything)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I think it looks good on you too.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yes. It's very dignified, despite being so extravagant.
 
**Artoria:**
It kind of makes me want to be seen, despite being a shy person.
 
**Muryan:**
Hmph. You all seem to have improved your teamwork since you were here last.
 
**Oberon:**
Oh? Are you feeling left out? Well, it's only natural, you being a bug and all.
 
**Muryan:**
On the contrary, I sure don't now.
 
**Muryan:**
How about you, Oberon? Are you perhaps feeling left out as well?
 
**Oberon:**
A little, to tell the truth. I can't believe you had those clothes ready.
 
**Oberon:**
Aah, I wanted Artoria's debut as Child of Prophecy to come later on,
 
**Oberon:**
and to make a huge show of it in Londinium!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Now, now. This served the same purpose. All the fairies in attendance were nobles, right?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Artoria defeated Tristan with her own strength. Now she also looks the part of Child of Prophecy.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The news'll spread throughout Britain by itself. And now that the third bell has been rung...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Muryan. Does this mean the Wing Clan recognizes Artoria as the Child of Prophecy?
 
**Muryan:**
Of course. Now that the bell has acknowledged Artoria, there's nothing more for me to say.
 
**Muryan:**
However, this doesn't change Gloucester's position.
 
**Muryan:**
You can thank Tristan for that this time.
 
**Muryan:**
I didn't offer you the bell, so that means I'm not rebelling against Her Majesty's rule.
 
**Muryan:**
Please don't get the wrong idea, I will not offer any aid to the Round Table Army.
 
**Muryan:**
Gloucester is a town that places fashion first. Under this rule, fairies and humans are equals, but&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
Fundamentally, I hate humans. Therefore, I also hate the Round Table Army.
 
**Muryan:**
Please think of me as not lending any support to you, unless I stand to make a large profit.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I see. So you're saying if there's a big enough problem, you'll switch sides?
 
**Muryan:**
Could you please not think that everyone you meet is your friend!?
 
**Muryan:**
Muramasa, your way of constantly acting like the main character is really irritating!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...? The hell are you talking about?
 
**Muryan:**
It's nothing. I'm very busy.
 
**Muryan:**
Wage whatever war you want. I'm going back to being a bookworm.
 
**Muryan:**
I bought a lot of Fairy Calendar materials off an archaeologist from Camelot.
 
**Muryan:**
Now that Baobhan Sith has learned her lesson and the bell has been rung,
 
**Muryan:**
could you please leave now if you have no other business?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where's Koyanskaya?
 
**Muryan:**
Oh, Lady Fox? She's...
 
**Muryan:**
She's away on other business. From what I understand, she finally found what she was looking for.
 
**Muryan:**
I'd wish her luck in her endeavours but...she wouldn't need such empty words, would she?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Sorry to keep you two waiting! We've safely returned from the demonic ball~!
 
**Gareth:**
Unbelievable~! I'm not very good at saying it, but Artoria is SOOOO COOOOOL&mdash;!
 
**Gareth:**
Your last outfit was really cool too, but this one really suits you!
 
**Artoria:**
You think so? Yeah, I guess you're right! Your new armor looks really awesome as well, Gareth!
 
**Habetrot:**
&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Habenyan?|
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
Haa!?
 
**Habetrot:**
Ah, no, I was just shocked at Artoria's new outfit. Don't worry about it.
 
**Habetrot:**
...It's surprising. I guess the Fairies of Paradise all have the same taste in fashion...
 
**Oberon:**
Good. Glad to see Gareth and Habetrot didn't run into any trouble either.
 
**Oberon:**
Well then, let's get out of Gloucester. Percival's waiting for us.
 
**Oberon:**
Oh, and I bought Red Rab-bit a souvenir. He seems a bit naïve, you know?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Awfully sensible of you.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I can think of someone who could probably learn from your example!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Speaking of souvenirs, you bought some before you left Gloucester last time, right?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I wonder how those fairies are doing. Do you want to go see them, Artoria?
 
**Da Vinci:**
You could introduce yourself as the Child of Prophecy now and nobody would suspect you.
 
**Artoria:**
Ah&mdash;the fairies from back then?
 
**Da Vinci:**
...?
 
**Oberon:**
&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
No, it's too late in the day to be doing that. We'll thank them next time.
 
**Oberon:**
Right, Artoria? You can see them whenever you come back to Gloucester.
 
**Artoria:**
Yes. I'm empty-handed at the moment, so the next chance I get I'll repay them many times over.
 
**Oberon:**
Well, time is money! We've got to talk about what we'll do next!
 
？1,1030,saveMaterial：Yeah, let's meet back up with Percival and the rest!
 
？2,2030,saveMaterial：(...I want to confirm something with Oberon...)
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Oh? What's up, Fujimaru? You've stopped in your tracks.
 
**Oberon:**
Did you forget something? Want to buy some fairy tea?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I want to ask you some questions, Oberon.|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Sure. Ask away.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Where were you the night before the battle at Londinium?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
...I see. Beryl Gut has quite the discerning eye.
 
**Oberon:**
You've got quite the nose for danger, and good instincts to boot. Well, I suppose you would need them.
 
**Oberon:**
...No point in hiding it now, and since you seem vaguely aware of what's going on, I'll speak frankly.
 
**Oberon:**
I was here that night. I came to negotiate, for the sake of our victory against Woodwose.
 
**Oberon:**
I wasn't talking to Muryan. The one I was talking to was your enemy, Koyanskaya.
 
**Oberon:**
I've had the constant sense that she's some sort of horrible monster, maybe just as disturbing as Morgan.
 
**Oberon:**
But she can still be used as a poison. No matter how you use it, poison is poison, right? That's how I see it, at least.
 
**Oberon:**
That's why I used it not on ourselves, but on Woodwose.
 
**Oberon:**
The Queen would have sent reinforcements to him. That was a given. After all, he's one of her most important warriors.
 
**Oberon:**
And if those reinforcements came, there would have been no way for Londinium to hold out.
 
**Oberon:**
Percival's definitely become an outstanding knight, but...
 
**Oberon:**
It's easy to make the mistake that everyone else is as capable as you are.
 
**Oberon:**
Percival loves every member of the Round Table Army, so he consequently overestimates their abilities.
 
**Oberon:**
Not that that's a bad thing. It's a weakness of his, but it's a strength of the Army itself.
 
**Oberon:**
...So, well...shady business like this has simply become a necessity.
 
**Oberon:**
Woodwose could see right through the Round Table Army's structure and tactics.
 
**Oberon:**
With the forces we could send out, he would counter them no matter what.
 
**Oberon:**
So I threw in something he couldn't foresee, something that doesn't exist in Britain. The poison known as Koyanskaya.
 
**Oberon:**
I knew where to find what she was looking for.
 
**Oberon:**
In return for telling her where it was, I asked her to intercept the Queen's reinforcements.
 
**Oberon:**
But...she surprised me.
 
**Oberon:**
I never expected them to just vanish completely without a trace.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I see...she does have her juvenile Beast form...)|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
...but man, what an underhanded scheme. I feel disgusted with myself.
 
**Oberon:**
But if this badge of shame is enough to lead us forward in the war, I won't hesitate.
 
**Oberon:**
When this is all over, you can punish me with your own hands.
 
**Oberon:**
That's why you brought it up, isn't it?
 
**Oberon:**
You could've just said nothing. But as a friend, you couldn't ignore it.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
The last days of the Edo period.
 
**Narration:**
To prepare for the coming era, the clans in Satsuma were recruiting talented youths,
 
**Narration:**
to send them to distant countries across the ocean.
 
**Narration:**
One such final destination was London, capital of the British Empire and the most advanced city on earth.
 
**Narration:**
That man was not chosen to study abroad.
 
**Narration:**
He was born into a poor samurai family with neither the rank nor wealth to leave a mark on history.
 
**Narration:**
That man was not chosen as a student, but could serve as a sailor on the ship that carried those who were.
 
**Narration:**
He couldn't remember why he left his country anymore.
 
**Narration:**
Did he not desire to witness the changing of the times? Did he harbor disgust towards his native culture?
 
**Narration:**
Or was it simply to experience the culture of a foreign land? He couldn't recall.
 
**Narration:**
But the man adored art more than his country, family, and fellows. In a sense, more than humanity itself.
 
**Narration:**
The one thing he could vaguely remember was the premonition he had when stepping onto the port.
 
**Narration:**
His eyes lit up at the world that lay before him.
 
**Narration:**
Compared to his hometown where all lay stagnant, it was hard to believe this landscape was of the same planet.
 
**Narration:**
The man abandoned his duty as a sailor and ventured through the foreign city with the aid of a map.
 
**Narration:**
Time passed like a dream. He wished he could stay longer.
 
**Narration:**
Nevertheless, the man was calculating enough to know reality. Dreams must be awoken from and commitments must be honored.
 
**Narration:**
If he returned to the harbor by sunrise, he could go back to his homeland, although he would be punished.
 
**Narration:**
Upon confirming he had time enough, he slipped into a third nobleman's mansion.
 
**Narration:**
The art housed within was wondrous.
 
**Narration:**
Especially the strangeness of the paintings, the sight of which took his breath away.
 
**Narration:**
As though leaving his heart behind, he slipped out of the mansion in time to make it back to the port at which his ship was docked.
 
**Narration:**
It took a day to realize he had wandered into an even stranger land.
 
**Man:**
Send me home. Send me home, please! Someone, anyone, please let me go back to Japan!
 
**Narration:**
The rest of his life was a true adventure.
 
**Narration:**
He was captured by the fairies, tasted the bitterness of slavery, then was discarded and set free at the end of his thirtieth year.
 
**Narration:**
Yet the man, not human by the Fairy Kingdom's standards, had life left in him still.
 
**Narration:**
The environment of the Fairy Kingdom proved too much for his 55-year-old body, but the man had three decades of observing fairies to draw on.
 
**Narration:**
He concealed his true self. Employed fairies. Eked out a business. Set fairy to kill fairy, then dissected and studied them.
 
**Narration:**
He made an elixir to slow his aging. The effect was minor, but better than nothing.
 
**Narration:**
After another 40 years, the external result was a young fairy, with an old man in his 90s within.
 
**Narration:**
His deception was confined to that of the Earth Clan.
 
**Narration:**
They were oddballs who respected technology, trusting others not for their character but the quality of their goods.
 
**Narration:**
At the end of the day, they were bad businessmen.
 
**Narration:**
The man became secretary to the one who headed the Earth Clan. The two barely stayed on good terms.
 
**Narration:**
But they kept a vague friendship alive. The Earth Clan chief valued the man enough to enter into business together.
 
**Narration:**
Spriggan & Capless. It was the birth of the first department store in the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Narration:**
Afterwards, the man plotted to kill the head of the Earth Clan.
 
**Narration:**
For Norwich's further development, and to other ends, only the partner's name was necessary.
 
**Narration:**
There was no one in the Fairy Kingdom who knew the man's original name, probably not even in pan-human history.
 
**Spriggan:**
Damn, I can hardly sleep at night with the torrent of orders we've taken since yesterday.
 
**Spriggan:**
Between Camelot, Londinium, and Edinburgh iron weapons are flying off the shelves.
 
**Spriggan:**
Woodwose's army in ruins. The Pilgrim's Bell in Gloucester.
 
**Spriggan:**
Anti-Morgan voices are growing not only among the fairies in the major cities, but even in the remote forest villages.
 
**Spriggan:**
After all...this is the result of 2,000 years of rule. I can scarce begin to imagine what Her Majesty's motives must be.
 
**Spriggan:**
Her Majesty Morgan is a great ruler, but the rabble cannot comprehend her achievements.
 
**Spriggan:**
Too few could measure the extent to which Her Majesty has acted.
 
**Spriggan:**
Those who live in the city cannot see past their homes. Rather, they cannot see the foundations upon which their cities lie.
 
**???:**
That's surprising. From the way you talk, one might think you want Morgan to rule.
 
**Spriggan:**
Not at all. I'm simply discussing facts.
 
**Spriggan:**
The opinions of the public, as well as yours truly, are that Her Majesty ought to take a rest.
 
**Spriggan:**
I speak not of the Queen being evil, but that her reign has gone on for too long.
 
**Spriggan:**
Her Majesty has created a fine kingdom, but its values are antiquated. She's 2,000 years old, after all.
 
**Spriggan:**
The fairies have long since improved their values after many generations.
 
**Spriggan:**
Standing policy to keep harmony with nature and continuing to shepherd humanity...it will keep this island small.
 
**Spriggan:**
Nothing dies harder than old ways. Obsolete parts have to be replaced.
 
**Spriggan:**
Naturally, I have no need to consider whether I should be King.
 
**Spriggan:**
In the pan-human history I once lived in, England was a land ruled by a queen.
 
**Spriggan:**
A queen is the only one suitable to sit on the throne of this Kingdom. Don't you agree?
 
**???:**
&mdash;Then who would you like to be Queen next?
 
**Spriggan:**
If there needs to be a new ruler, I'd hope to see a radiant fairy who loves her people.
 
**Spriggan:**
One more beautiful than all others, surpassed only by her wickedness; and oblivious to her own stupidity.
 
**Spriggan:**
That's one worth supporting. I've had a bellyful of serving crafty leaders.
 
**???:**
I know who you mean. You and I just might get along fine.
 
**???:**
But she's got real dull eyes. She'll never defeat Morgan, much less seize the throne.
 
**Spriggan:**
Indeed. There's only one person I judge capable of defeating Morgan.
 
**Spriggan:**
They were discovered earlier by soldiers who had been monitoring the battlefields.
 
**Spriggan:**
It's only a matter of when to put them into play. My, I'm glad for my time in England.
 
**Spriggan:**
Everyone is unfamiliar with the rule allowing the use of captured pieces.
 
**Spriggan:**
One doesn't gain a secret weapon by birth, but through development while fighting.
 
**Spriggan:**
Still&mdash;I only speak of a game I've had no one with which to play this last century.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Overlooked, overlooked...! The queen's daughter shown mercy...!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Even though Beryl was helping me, and this time I even got serious...!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
And yet...and yet&mdash;
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Why? Why couldn't I win!? I'm my mother's only daughter, so whyyyyy!!!!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
...Haa...haa...haaa...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
...I'm the only daughter she'll ever need...and the only one who can use magecraft...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
...If I just...had my own personal magecraft, worthy of a queen's daughter&mdash;
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
&mdash;ah.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Well, in the end, victory is mine.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I'll just borrow the Garden off of Mother's throne.
 
## Section 17: Manchester 
 
**Gareth:**
Percivaaaaaaaal! We're baaaaaaack!
 
**Percival:**
Oh good. I'm glad you're all okay.
 
**Percival:**
And great work, Artoria.
 
**Percival:**
It seems the sound of the Pilgrim's Bell has echoed throughout Britain.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
As a Knight Rider under exclusive contract with all of you, I am deeply moved as well.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
By the way, did you get me a souvenir?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
In case you've forgotten, all of us fairy horses had a rough job hoofing everyone from Londinium to Gloucester.
 
**Oberon:**
Of course. Here you go, some hair tonic and suntan oil. We got them from some shady back-alley shop.
 
**Oberon:**
Because of Artoria's success the last time we were there, they're selling a lot of magic items at the moment. These are some of them.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Hair tonic for a horse is a bit...
 
**Oberon:**
No need to hide it. We know you're a very style-conscious fairy who cares a lot about fashion.
 
**Oberon:**
And as you can see, Artoria has changed her look too. The truth is&mdash;you did too, right?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
You're a wonderful man, Oberon. A dodgy back-alley shop, how very romantic.
 
**Oberon:**
Alright, now that Rab-bit's in a good mood, let's get back to Londinium.
 
**Oberon:**
Next is Oxford's bell. When the fourth one rings, it'll finally be all-out war...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, but before that, hold on a minute. We've got other things to take care of first.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'd like to discuss our plans for the future, so let's go someplace else.
 
**Oberon:**
Hm? A secret discussion? Then should we go to that forest off the main highway?
 
**Mors:**
&ndash;!
 
**Oberon:**
Sorry, bad choice! It's a Mors den!
 
**Percival:**
Fairies, please stand back! Leave this to us of the Round Table Army!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Your concern is not needed! Mors will never be able to touch my body!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Behold, my boiling flesh! I am Red Rab-bit, the Flying Fairy Horse of Flame!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Lord Percival! Lord Gareth! Now is the time for the Round Table Knights to show their true strength!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
I meant the order in which we ring the Pilgrim's Bells.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The one in Oxford can be rung at any time. We know where it is, and Woodwose is no longer in the picture.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So before that, I propose we head for Orkney.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right now, Morgan's eyes are fixed on Oxford. She shouldn't be paying any attention to the north.
 
**Percival:**
I see...you're certainly right. And we have to go to Orkney regardless.
 
**Percival:**
We also have a chance now that the Queen's army hasn't been dispatched.
 
**Oberon:**
Still, we're not out of the woods yet.
 
**Oberon:**
If we head for Orkney, the Queen's army will be dispatched to pursue us, and we'll run into Knocknarea's army as well.
 
**Oberon:**
Wouldn't it be safer to move the Round Table Army towards Camelot, and then head there guarded by the troops?
 
**Da Vinci:**
No. If we move with our army, so will Knocknarea.
 
**Da Vinci:**
She's declared herself Artoria's rival, and thinks the whole “Child of Prophecy” thing is an irritant.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If Artoria moves publicly, she'll have no choice but to interfere due to her position as Queen.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But the northern fairies are the power we need to wage war on Morgan. I'd rather not fight them if we can avoid it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Am I right, Percival? Artoria?
 
**Percival:**
Yes. I would very much like to forge an alliance with the northern fairies.
 
**Percival:**
Not to oppose the Queen, but as fellow Britons.
 
**Percival:**
Unfortunately, we can't even sit down to discuss it. We've sent envoys several times, but...
 
**Artoria:**
Knocknarea hates humans...or, it's more like...
 
**Artoria:**
Well, that's more or less the case.
 
**Artoria:**
I agree with Da Vinci. I think Orkney is a good choice for the fourth bell.
 
**Artoria:**
On the way back, let's stop by Knocknarea's main camp. I'm sure we can negotiate with her now.
 
**Gareth:**
Since you're the genuine Child of Prophecy now! The Chocolate Queen can't ignore Artoria any more!
 
**Gareth:**
But how can we make it all the way to Orkney without being spotted?
 
**Percival:**
...Why not go through the Lake District?
 
**Percival:**
The northwestern part of Britain is all wetlands covered in forests and fog. The terrain is unsuited for marches and it's full of Mors.
 
**Percival:**
Neither Knocknarea's nor the Queen's armies will even go near it.
 
**Percival:**
Naturally, it's a more dangerous route than using the main roads, but...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No, that works, doesn't it? Let's do it.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We're a small party. We're better suited to fending off Mors than dodging an entire army anyway.
 
**Oberon:**
...Well, that's certainly true. What do you think, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If we can move in secret, all the better.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, if it's Da Vinci's idea...
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
I see. It's decided then.
 
**Oberon:**
I'm not a fan of separating you from the army, but you guys have been an elite bunch from the start.
 
**Oberon:**
You probably won't have any trouble getting through the Lake District. Good luck, guys.
 
**Artoria:**
You're not coming along, Oberon?
 
**Oberon:**
Nah, I'm not. The Round Table Army's in the middle of a huge expansion. I can't take my eyes off it now.
 
**Oberon:**
Powering up the Child of Prophecy using the Pilgrim's Bells is important, but we also need to strengthen the army.
 
**Oberon:**
I'd like to secure Oxford's bell for that, and I want Percival at the Round Table Army's head.
 
**Oberon:**
Londinium will be a little understaffed, but if we can secure Oxford,
 
**Oberon:**
I'd say Londinium will have fulfilled its role by now. The Queen's army will have no reason to send troops to occupy it.
 
**Percival:**
...Then it's settled.
 
**Percival:**
Artoria, Fujimaru, Muramasa, Da Vinci, Gareth, Habetrot.
 
**Percival:**
You six will head for Orkney's bell by way of the Lake District.
 
**Percival:**
Red Rab-bit, can I ask you to lend your aid to them?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Leave the trip up to the Lake District to me.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Once you enter there, you won't be able to use a carriage. I'll see you all off there, and then...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
I'll conceal myself in Edinburgh as a wandering knight.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
You'll all stop by there on your way back, won't you? We'll meet back up there.
 
**Oberon:**
What a tidy plan. You're surprisingly capable, you know that?
 
**Oberon:**
What were you doing as a valet in Aurora's service?
 
**Oberon:**
You could have gone far if you served under Woodwose.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Hahaha. As you can see, I am like the wind, so the Wind Clan's city suits me better.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But you said flames just a second ago...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Red Rab-bit, faster than the wind.
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Then we'll return to Londinium with Oberon.
 
**Gareth:**
Please wait. I'll go back too.
 
**Gareth:**
...I'm sorry, Artoria.
 
**Gareth:**
I know it's selfish of me to say as the Child of Prophecy's first knight, but..
 
**Gareth:**
I'm not sure one more person like myself will make much of a difference...
 
**Gareth:**
Still, there's something I can do. I can't leave the people of Londinium behind.
 
**Artoria:**
You don't need to apologize, Gareth. You've found the place where you belong.
 
**Artoria:**
Don't worry! I'll have Fujimaru, Da Vinci, and Muramasa with me!
 
**Artoria:**
I'll miss you, but we'll see each other again soon! When we meet in Londinium again, we'll both have grown a little more!
 
**Gareth:**
Yeah! I'll be listening for the bell to ring!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, we're off.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You take care too, Oberon.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Yeah. Have a safe trip.
 
**Oberon:**
The coast up there is full of ash and is pretty dang cold.
 
**Oberon:**
Neither Blanca nor I can cross the sea, so I can't tell you anything about Orkney.
 
**Oberon:**
But there's no way it can be worse than the Russian Lostbelt you guys went through.
 
**Oberon:**
Oh, and look after Artoria. As much as she puts up a brave face, she's still a wreck on the inside.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You think so?|
 
**Oberon:**
I know so. She's been through a lot. She's the best in Britain at hiding her true feelings behind a smile.
 
**Oberon:**
So don't pay it too much heed. I'd like you to lend her a hand.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Yeah, I know.
 
**Oberon:**
Haha, looks like I handed out a bit of unnecessary advice. If you can see through that, then I can send you off without any worries.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
...Right then. Once Orkney and Oxford's bells ring, there will be no more sitting around.
 
**Oberon:**
Where could the sixth bell be? We'll find it, somehow.
 
**Oberon:**
And then comes the decisive battle with Morgan. Our odds of winning are slim, though.
 
**Oberon:**
Moreover, I don't get the feeling that taking her out will solve everything.
 
**Oberon:**
...There's someone, something in Britain that's cursed all living things.
 
**Oberon:**
...What it is exactly, we don't know, but...
 
**Oberon:**
Listen, Fujimaru. We still don't know enough about Britain's history.
 
**Oberon:**
Orkney may have some kind of clue about how this world came to be.
 
**Oberon:**
Knowing that might give us the key to Morgan's defeat.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
...I can hear the tolling of the bells.
 
**Narration:**
For the past 16 years, I have heard my own voice call out to me in a completely unchanging dream.
 
**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
It's all we can do right now. I think it'll definitely be useful for something.
 
**Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
So please, take it. I'm begging you.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Yes. I'll gladly keep it safe. The Child of Prophecy will definitely be overjoyed to hear that.
 
**A：Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:**
I see...yeah, of course! Everyone, be sure to keep the Child safe!
 
**Narration:**
I didn't really want to take it, did I?
 
**Narration:**
Everything they offered was junk. In the eyes of an upper-class fairy, it would be seen as a heap of worthless trash.
 
**Narration:**
But to them, trying to live day by day, those things were indispensable treasures.
 
**Narration:**
I could see it. I could see their feelings and their future.
 
**Narration:**
The feelings they clung to so tightly. The joy of believing in something warm.
 
**Narration:**
Those tearful eyes of gratitude, as if saying they were happy to be alive, even if life had been trying.
 
**Narration:**
And then...the next morning, it would be gone. All of it.
 
**Narration:**
The next time I visited Gloucester, they were nowhere to be found.
 
**Narration:**
They didn't have much time left, so they had never put their hopes in the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Narration:**
They wanted to live on for longer, but even more than that, they wanted to help the Child of Prophecy, so they offered up all they had left.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;So really. Seriously, give me a break.
 
**Narration:**
An unfamiliar Britain in an unfamiliar world.
 
**Narration:**
On the outskirts of a deserted town, the figure of a squire—a young boy—stands under the setting sun.
 
**Narration:**
A girl—me—who was raised as a boy.
 
**Narration:**
The girl—Artoria—holds the Sword of Selection, even though no one told her to do so.
 
**Merlin the Magician:**
“In a Britain where destruction is a foregone conclusion, a king is akin to a human sacrifice.”
 
**Merlin the Magician:**
“People will wholly entrust you with the hope that all will be well in the end.”
 
**Merlin the Magician:**
“At the same time, they will wholly curse you for all that goes wrong.”
 
**Merlin the Magician:**
“There will be nothing good about it. Honestly, it will be nothing but hardship, won't it?”
 
**Narration:**
Behind her stands a magus with a kind face. “Don't do it,” he reproves her.
 
**Merlin the Magician:**
“Think long and hard before you make your decision.”
 
**Merlin the Magician:**
“The very moment you pull it out, your life will no longer be that of a human.”
 
**Narration:**
That's right. Think well. No, there's no need to think about it. Considering something like this is laughable, isn't it?
 
**Narration:**
If the world should come to an end, everyone should shoulder that responsibility. Everyone should curse everyone, and it should all come to an end impartially.
 
**Narration:**
And yet, why?
 
**Female Squire:**
“&mdash;Many people were smiling.”
 
**Female Squire:**
“As such, I cannot think this a mistake.”
 
**Narration:**
That was the result.
 
**Narration:**
Despite having restored people, cities, and a country, she was ostracized by people and knights alike.
 
**Narration:**
Never knowing joy; crushed bearing the weight of others' desires.
 
**Narration:**
In the end, she saw everything she had built fall to ruin, friends tearing each other to pieces.
 
**Narration:**
In the end, she died alone, as all others died before her.
 
**Narration:**
It's absurd. It's absurd. It's absurd.
 
**Narration:**
Take advantage of the situation and disregard it forever. Just forget it all, as easily as you would after you're done enjoying a story.
 
**Narration:**
Why would you go that far? Why would you decide to go that far?
 
**Narration:**
There was no reason at all for you to become King. You just had the “strength to do so”.
 
**Narration:**
I just don't understand.
 
**Narration:**
Looking at her life—my life—this way, there is just no way I can see it as noble in the slightest.
 
**C：Artoria Caster:**
After all, you could have left it all to someone else, couldn't you?
 
**Narration:**
The worst words come spilling out. She was facing away from me, but gently looked back, and said:
 
**Female Squire:**
You're right. I also think there was someone better suited for this.
 
**C：Artoria Caster:**
Then why? Why did you do it?
 
**Female Squire:**
Well&mdash;
 
**Female Squire:**
You know that better than anyone, don't you?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
We've traveled north along the main road all night, and it's almost noon now.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Everyone, at this pace we will reach the edge of the Lake District before nightfall.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
I'll be bidding you farewell there for a short while, but please don't forget about me.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, actually, I'd like to make a small detour. Could you change course, and head west on the highway?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Manchester is that way, right? I'd like to stop by there before we head to the Lake District.
 
**Artoria:**
Manchester is Barghest's domain! Is that alright, Fujimaru!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It can't be helped.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought this would be the case.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Aagh, you're a dog person too! T-then, what about Muramasa!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Huh? Are you surprised?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You didn't think it would come to this when Da Vinci suggested going to Orkney?
 
**Artoria:**
Oh well, I'm sorry I didn't see this coming! Habetrot! Did you pick up on this!?
 
**Habetrot:**
Da Vinci asked me about it when we boarded the carriage.
 
**Habetrot:**
She said we should make a detour before Orkney, if that was okay.
 
**Artoria:**
Even Habenyan knew...I'm supposed to be the leader here, and yet...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Sorry, sorry. If I asked you, you'd have disagreed immediately...and even if you didn't say it, I'd see it on your face.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Barghest is still a Fairy Knight loyal to the Queen. I didn't want Percival or Oberon to hear about this.
 
**Artoria:**
...W-well, if we said that we would be going into enemy territory, it would cause Percival unnecessary worry...
 
**Artoria:**
And Oberon wouldn't have liked it, after his forest was burned to the ground...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Manchester is a nice place.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
It's a rather idyllic fairy town, an opposite to Oxford, which is becoming overrun with restaurants.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
In Gloucester there is a “rule” against fighting, but in Manchester, everybody generally hates violence.
 
**Artoria:**
Even though the rule there is “survival of the fittest?”
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Hahaha. There are some rather subtle differences between your definition of that and Barghest's.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
But seeing is believing. If that is the case, I shall make a magnificent turn and head towards Manchester.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
The place is peace itself, a wild garden.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Under no circumstances will there be a fight. Trust the words of me, Red Rab-bit!

**Fujimaru 1:**

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Well, now I know there will be one.)

**Narration:**
~Manchester, Main Street~
 
**Narration:**
~Stopping by a bar for a short visit~
 
**Partygoing Fairy:**
Hyaa&ndash;! Strong-looking tourists&mdash;! I can't help myself&ndash;! Get them!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Barghest:**
Uugh...uaaagh...uaaaaaah...!
 
**Narration:**
I have dreamt of this “act” countless times before.
 
**Narration:**
I am sobbing. As I do so, the one I call my lover is being ■ ■ ■-en.
 
**Narration:**
Delicious. Delightful. Joyful. Painful. Sorrowful. Despairing.
 
**Narration:**
Predation is a natural part of life in the wild. In order to survive we have to seek out, love, and become one with others.
 
**Narration:**
The law of the wild—this rule—is my pride.
 
**Narration:**
Even among the Fang Clan, I am especially gifted in body and soul.
 
**Narration:**
If you are born strong, you have a duty to protect and rule over the weak.
 
**Narration:**
I have to be strong, and in order to be strong I have to e-■ ■ the strong.
 
**Narration:**
You see? My rule is correct. My love is only for the strong.
 
**Narration:**
E-■ ■ what you love, and become one with the wild. I was born with such a principle.
 
**Narration:**
To protect Britain—to protect the weak—I need to continue ea-■ ■ ■ ■ the strong.
 
**Narration:**
But, in truth...
 
**Narration:**
The truth is&mdash;
 
**???:**
You're crying again, ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■. Hey, come here.
 
**???:**
It's alright, just let it all out. Tell me what happened to you today.
 
**???:**
Was it something difficult? Something sad?
 
**???:**
If it had to do with me, I'll laugh. If it was about someone else, I'll get mad.
 
**???:**
Whatever it was, tell me how you feel.
 
**???:**
It's okay. No matter how shameful it was, I won't hate you for it.
 
**Narration:**
A body that seemed to be on the verge of collapse. A voice that seemed like it would be lost any day now.
 
**Narration:**
He, the weakest creature I'd ever known, protected my broken heart.
 
**???:**
Hey, when you have a rough time, you should talk about something you like. How about your beloved Knights of the Round Table?
 
**???:**
The flotsam that washed ashore in the Changeling. Showy, prideful, and rather lonesome.
 
**???:**
The story of those gallant knights you so adore.
 
**Narration:**
They didn't do it because they were forced to, they did it because they were born that way.
 
**Narration:**
Lordly. Prideful. They protected the weak, enacted justice.
 
**Narration:**
Even though it was a story from another world, I adored them.
 
**Narration:**
I'm sure a base fairy such as myself could never measure up to them.
 
**Narration:**
Whenever I voiced such complaints, he would smile softly...
 
**???:**
Look at the garden. The flowers you planted are coming in beautifully.
 
**???:**
You put in a new one for me today, since I can't walk.
 
**???:**
You're very kind. Thank you.
 
**???:**
I pray the day comes when the pain in your heart may be eased&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
That's right. She truly loves others, living her life by devouring her lovers,
 
**Narration:**
hoping that this time she herself won't fall prey to her cravings.
 
**Narration:**
She is at her limit. She would have reached it long ago.
 
**Narration:**
I don't know how many times she has tried to ease the burden on herself, but&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
She's a responsible one who cannot accept the end that came to be, so to atone for the sin of devouring her lovers,
 
**Narration:**
she has continued to maintain the peace in Britain, all the while concealing her shattered feelings.
 
**Narration:**
She's incredibly admirable; that's why I want to help her.
 
**???:**
It's far too sad that you, the most upstanding of fairies, would end your life.
 
**???:**
Let's form a contract, Barghest. It's far too early in the story for you to fall under this curse.
 
**C：Festive Fairy:**
Sorry! Jenny's really sorry!
 
**Store Owner:**
...I'm truly sorry about this, sirs and madams.
 
**Store Owner:**
I'll give these morons a proper scolding later, so please let this slide.
 
**Store Owner:**
They're just a bunch of trend-chasing fools...
 
**Store Owner:**
You know how there are rumors that Camelot is preparing for war?
 
**Store Owner:**
Well, these guys decided that they wanted to play soldier too. Up until now they were content with tabletop games, but...
 
**C：Festive Fairy:**
But listen, they're really strong fairies and humans, you know? Jenny thought it'd be lots of fun!
 
**Store Owner:**
You idiot. We're in the midst of welcoming Lord Barghest back, remember?
 
**Store Owner:**
All of us would have lost our heads for breaking the rules, had there been any casualties.
 
**Store Owner:**
You should be thankful of these guys' strength and open minds. Also, I'm not serving you any more drinks.
 
**C：Festive Fairy:**
What, no fair! Just when we got our hands on human alcohol!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, after all that, would you care to amend your assertion, Red Rab-bit?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
How strange...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Manchester was a city full of smiling faces, kindness, and now violence...
 
**C：Remorseful Fairy:**
It's not violence! The Rule of Manchester is survival of the fittest!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You followed us from the tavern...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh? The same type of fairy as in Wales?
 

---

 
**C：Remorseful Fairy:**
Jenny's name is Jenny! Jenny was born here just recently!
 
**Artoria:**
Aah, no wonder...
 
**Artoria:**
So you don't know much about Manchester, Jenny?
 
**Artoria:**
Do you know where the city's lord lives?
 
**Jenny:**
Lord Barghest lives over there! Look, all the way at the end of the main street!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, you can definitely see it. The huge mansion with a magnificent garden.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Still...I thought Manchester would be a city housing mostly the Fang Clan, but I guess there are even fairies like you here as well.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Are there fairies of the Earth Clan here as well?
 
**Jenny:**
Hmm, maybe...We don't see much of them. There are lots of humans though. About half humans, half fairies.
 
**Habetrot:**
Hm? There's nothing but fairies roaming around, though. Are there really that many humans?
 
**Jenny:**
That's the survival of the fittest! “The weak have to be protected by the strong!”
 
**Jenny:**
It protects Jenny too! Lord Barghest is strict, but kind and fun!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
“Survival of the fittest,” huh...I see.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I kind of got that from Barghest's attitude...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
but that doesn't mean “the strong eat the weak,”  does it?
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, she's always been like that.
 
**Artoria:**
“The strong eat only the strong. The weak aren't worthy of being eaten. They deserve protection.”
 
**Artoria:**
That's what she says.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...may as well ask now...)|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria, are you and Barghest childhood friends?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
H-how could you think something like that? I mean, Barghest had no idea who I was, right?
 
**Artoria:**
She doesn't know me, and I don't know her...
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, I don't know the first thing about Barghest!
 
**Jenny:**
Hah? If you're looking for Barghest, you should've just asked Jenny. She's at home right now.
 
**Jenny:**
They say she's got a new lover, so she comes home often. Everyone in town is so happy.
 
**Artoria:**
She acts like a Fairy Knight, but she's the only one who gets herself a lover!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
But, Barghest's lover, you say... Neigh... I can't say anything more out of fear...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, rumors are rumors. She never mentioned it, so we should take it with a grain of salt.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Even if it's true, they're living as husband and wife, you know? If they're okay with it, then what's the problem?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if it's done out of love, a crime is still a crime. This is the Fairy Kingdom, after all. Each law is absolute.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, we've come this far, so we may as well meet with Barghest.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You can wait here if you're afraid, Red Rab-bit. We're the only ones who have to talk to her.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
No...I've accompanied you this far, so I will come as well.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
I cannot help being the idol of men and women of all ages. It's the price of fame.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Should the need arise, I will use my flesh as bait to buy time for you all to escape. No, I shall become a wall of delicious meat!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Now, to the hall of the demonic lord! The horrible, fairy-devouring Black Dog is no match for me!
 
**J：Barghest:**
Welcome to Manchester, everybody.
 
**J：Barghest:**
I didn't think you would come to call on me in less than a day.
 
**F：Horse:**
&mdash;Beautiful&mdash;
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Who could call you repulsive...this is the form of a noble...no, a true king...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
I, Red Rab-bit, feel as though I have been overtaken at the final corner of a race.
 
**J：Barghest:**
Th-thank you very much? Uh...where is this Fang from, exactly?
 
**Artoria:**
Ignore him. He's just a packhorse who doesn't understand that he's not the main character.
 
**Artoria:**
Habenyan, could you take him for a walk?
 
**Habetrot:**
You got it~. Come on, let's go into the garden, Red Rab-bit. There's a fun-looking clearing for you.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Oho...that's called a paddock, Habetrot.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
A clan fairy's mansion sure is nice...so many facilities they don't even use...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for making us feel welcome.|
 
**J：Barghest:**
No need to thank me. As Lord, it is my duty to entertain guests.
 
**J：Barghest:**
I was the one who invited you in the first place. I should be thanking you.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're wearing a dress today too?
 
**J：Barghest:**
This is...I just got home myself. I haven't had time to change.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, whatever the case, I'm pleased you're showing us in without frisking us.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I know you don't feel like fighting. We can safely talk in&mdash;Barghest?
 
**Barghest:**
No. I bear no enmity towards you, but I am more than willing to fight. Behold.
 
**Artoria:**
...! What do you think you're doing, Barghest!?
 
**Barghest:**
This has nothing to do with you. Could I ask you to please stay out of this?
 
**Barghest:**
Master of Chaldea, Fujimaru. And Servant, Leonardo da Vinci.
 
**Barghest:**
It may be selfish of me, but I challenge you.
 
**Barghest:**
Once more, would you show me that power...please?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Of course.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(You want to see Chaldea's power for yourself, don't you, Barghest.)
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
I see. You want to take measure of Chaldea's power before talking to us.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So you're saying that unless we can defeat you without the Child of Prophecy's help, you won't place your trust in us?
 
**Barghest:**
I am. And more than that, Fujimaru has piqued my curiosity.
 
**Barghest:**
How far can a mere human go against a fairy—no.
 
**Barghest:**
Prove to me that your victories before weren't mere flukes!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just when I thought the battle was over...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We were served this fantastic meal.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Wow, this gnocchi is amazing! Seems like you can't go wrong with potatoes no matter the world!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
These oysters are great too!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I was a little unsure when they served them on a huge plate covered in ice, but I get it now, it's so they stay delicious!
 
**Artoria:**
Everyone, please don't be fooled by this amazing-looking food. This isn't a big deal at all.
 
**Artoria:**
The meat pie in the center of the table, as big as Gareth's shield, is a good representation of Bageko's vanity.
 
**Artoria:**
She's obviously trying to break everyone's focus. Well, I won't fall for it.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So she says, shoveling meat pie into her mouth...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Oh no...it's good...
 
**Barghest:**
The battle and cooking are finished, so I've had a change of clothes.
 
**Barghest:**
Unfortunately, I am currently under house arrest, so I gave the cooks some time off.
 
**Barghest:**
I made all this, so I'm happy you enjoy it. I'm sorry it's all so simple.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Barghest's...homemade...|
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
That's right. It's no big deal.
 
**Barghest:**
After all, I just used wheat as the basic ingredient, threw it in the wood stove, and imitated human cooking methods.
 
**Barghest:**
It's nothing like the real thing in Camelot. This is just a hobby of mine.
 
**Artoria:**
H-heh heh...you're surprisingly homey for how you look, o great Fairy Knight.
 
**Artoria:**
It must be hard to act as a lord when you have to work in your own kitchens.
 
**Barghest:**
Hm? Isn't it only natural for someone looking for a mate to be good at household chores?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's not talk about it.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks for the meal. Now, onto the main point.
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
Right. Now that we've come this far, there's nothing left but to get down to brass tacks.
 
**Barghest:**
I want to protect the inhabitants of Britain. It was for that reason I swore my horn to the Queen.
 
**Barghest:**
However...Her Majesty has no such intentions, and actually seems to be seeking out the Great Calamity.
 
**Barghest:**
What she treasures is not Britain's inhabitants, but the kingdom itself.
 
**Barghest:**
Therefore&mdash;Child of Prophecy.
 
**Barghest:**
If you ring the Pilgrim's Bells and truly aim to save Britain, then I will lend my strength to your endeavours.
 
**Barghest:**
The battle for Camelot can no longer be avoided, so I too will raise the flag of rebellion against the Queen.
 
**Artoria:**
You're serious...
 
**Artoria:**
That's all well and good, but what happened to your pride as a knight? You destroyed that farm and burned down the forest of Wales.
 
**Artoria:**
You've been so faithful to the Queen's orders, and now you're going to join our side?
 
**Barghest:**
Yes. From hereon I will join you.
 
**Barghest:**
You can put me on trial for my crimes after the battle for Camelot.
 
**Barghest:**
I will accept any punishment, and expect no pardon.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
**Barghest:**
But first, I would like for you to promise me something.
 
**Barghest:**
Fujimaru, Da Vinci. You mentioned that emigration was possible.
 
**Barghest:**
If that is the truth, and you have the magnanimity to accept fairies...
 
**Barghest:**
Will you please consider letting them emigrate?
 
**Barghest:**
Her Majesty has told me that Britain is what is known as a “Lostbelt.”
 
**Barghest:**
A transient world that will dissipate in the face of pan-human history.
 
**Barghest:**
So I supposed...this Britain is a world that should not be.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...why do you think this, Barghest?
 
**Da Vinci:**
You yearn to protect Britain, yet you deny its existence. Isn't that a contradiction?
 
**Barghest:**
That's because...more than anything else, we're afraid of this land.
 
**Barghest:**
That's probably why... Ask any fairy and they'll give you the same answer.
 
**Barghest:**
In any case, under Her Majesty's rule, all fairies die out by the end of the year.
 
**Barghest:**
I don't know how the reign of the Child of Prophecy will change the way things are, but&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
If there are any fairies who wish to relocate to the “outside world,” I ask you to accept them.
 
**Barghest:**
Even&mdash;even though this Britain may come to disappear...
 
**Barghest:**
I have no greater hope than the fairies born here being able to live in your world.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'd like the opinion of my technical advisor.|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Right. It's a very interesting proposition. We don't really have a reason to turn you down.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Storm Border can accept up to 500 refugees.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Relocation will have to wait until after we solve the problem of the Earth's bleached state,
 
**Da Vinci:**
but there's no problem with you living in the Border. That was its original purpose anyway.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Call it a Noah's Ark of sorts.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's only a few ships in pan-human history whose purpose is to preserve life forms for the future.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Five hundred, huh. Though that's only a fraction of them. You okay with that, Barghest?
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;Yes. Better than being able to save none. This is fine.
 
**Barghest:**
If that promise...no, if my wish is honored, I shall gladly bear the shame of being labelled a traitor.
 
**Barghest:**
Though I'm sure the real Sir Gawain would despise me for it...
 
**Barghest:**
Even if it was only in mind, how could one bearing the name of a Knight of the Round Table betray their lord?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gawain would probably scold you, but also praise you for it.|
 
**Barghest:**
Y-yes, of course. I'd be scolded first...
 
**Da Vinci:**
But are you really okay with this? Think of your position. You're placing your trust in your enemies.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...but are you really okay with this?
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
I am. It is as you said, Fujimaru.
 
**Barghest:**
“If the world were gone tomorrow, I wouldn't let that ruin today.”
 
**Barghest:**
Those words resonated with me... I should do all I can now, before concerning myself with the future.
 
**Artoria:**
Ugh. Guess that's how it'll be. Though I can't say I don't like it when you look like that.
 
**Artoria:**
I'll tell Oberon about this later...
 
**Artoria:**
Fairy Knight Barghest is cooperating with the Child of Prophecy, and will play an active role in the battle for Camelot.
 
**Artoria:**
Once the battle for the castle begins, you must absolutely not attack the Round Table Army.
 
**Artoria:**
What else...well, neutralize whatever Queen's soldiers you see if the mood strikes you.
 
**Artoria:**
Those are my only instructions to you. Do you have anything to say, Barghest?
 
**Barghest:**
...you didn't tell me to open the gates to the castle from inside. There's no need for you to concern yourself with my...
 
**Artoria:**
I simply don't trust you enough to rely on you for anything else.
 
**Artoria:**
I will knock down that gate with my trusted friends here. You just fight what's in front of you.
 
**Barghest:**
...I see. If my words turned out to be false, you would be locked in a stalemate.
 
**Barghest:**
Then that is the correct response. Still...you're more unforgiving than I imagined you would be.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, it probably won't come to that.|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
By the way, sorry to change the subject...|
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
What is it? I'll answer if I can.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Could you introduce us to your lover, Barghest?|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, that caught my interest too~! We heard about it outside.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That you're always coming back to Manchester, since you've got a new lover here!
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;Well, not always...but...um, as much as I can...?
 
**Barghest:**
And we're not in any sort of relationship like that. It's just a human boy I'm watching over.
 
**Barghest:**
I, Barghest, only love the strong.
 
**Barghest:**
There is no way I would take someone with no strength, no vitality, and no future prospects as my lover.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Is that so? They say love is blind. Can't you fall in love with someone who doesn't live up to your standards?
 
**Barghest:**
Y-you have an idiom like that...? Human culture in pan-human history is truly enlightened...
 
**Barghest:**
But that has nothing to do with it.
 
**Barghest:**
Adonis is weak and sickly. Right now he's recuperating in a room in a quiet wing of the mansion.
 
**Barghest:**
When I told him about Fujimaru, his eyes lit up and he wanted to meet you, but...
 
**Barghest:**
He hasn't stopped coughing lately... It's a symptom of the Great Calamity, and medicine has become difficult to acquire.
 
**Barghest:**
I'm sorry, but he needs rest now. However...
 
**Barghest:**
After the battle for Camelot, I'd like for you to return to meet him.
 
**Barghest:**
I don't know if I'll be able to return here, but I'm sure you would become great friends.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I see. Sorry for the insensitive remarks.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You never did want to protect just the fairies, did you?
 
**Barghest:**
Of course not. Uneducated humans are disciplined, but that's just fundamental survival skills in Britain.
 
**Barghest:**
Fairies and humans are one and the same. I don't see a distinction between them. After all, protecting the fairies means protecting the humans as well.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, this was a fruitful discussion. It was worth making a detour to Manchester.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Seems like it was a nice break for Artoria as well. Must have been fun for her to talk with a fairy she shares a connection with, huh?
 
**Da Vinci:**
And she got to munch on pie the whole time!
 
**Artoria:**
No, it's the exact opposite! This was more exhausting than acting as “Child of Prophecy” for the Round Table Army!
 
**Artoria:**
Well, now that you're all done making friends, let's hurry up and go! We've got to reach the Lake District before the sun sets!
 
**Barghest:**
The Lake District...? I see...you're going to Orkney.
 
**Barghest:**
There aren't as many Mors up north, but they're much stronger individually.
 
**Barghest:**
The ones lurking in the Lake District are all powerful individuals. Tread with caution.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for the warning.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll be seeing you, then.
 

---

 
**Barghest:**
...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Barghest? You look like something is still bothering you.
 
**Barghest:**
Yeah... During the meal, you taught me about the relationship between Master and Servant.
 
**Barghest:**
Her Majesty has given me some knowledge of Servants.
 
**Barghest:**
Spiritual bodies drawn from a “compiled record of human history” that exists outside of time...the Throne of Heroes.
 
**Barghest:**
They are summoned by the Master and used in times of crisis.
 
**Barghest:**
The Servant stays with one Master and leaves when that Master dies.
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;Am I correct thus far?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. What of it?
 
**Barghest:**
...don't you think it's strange?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What about it? That a Servant would obey a Master weaker than themself?
 
**Barghest:**
I've had that concern since the beginning, but the problem I am referring to...
 
**Barghest:**
...concerns Beryl Gut.
 
**Barghest:**
That man said that Queen Morgan was the Servant he summoned.
 
**Barghest:**
But Her Majesty has never once referred to him as a Master, and what's more&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
Beryl Gut only arrived here a few months ago. Her Majesty Morgan is a great fairy who has lived for 2,000 years.
 
**Barghest:**
It doesn't add up. Even before Beryl Gut arrived here, Her Majesty was very much alive.
 
**Barghest:**
Or is it possible to summon someone who already exists as a Servant?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I've never heard of it, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
To tell the truth, that's been bothering me too.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Summoning the future state of someone who is alive in the present...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, if you take into account Heroic Spirits with extremely twisted, complex personal histories, there is precedent for that.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Pan-human history's Morgan was a Heroic Spirit with three personas, so I can't say it's impossible.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But...if that were the case, there would be two Morgans in this kingdom.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Have you witnessed anything like that, or heard any rumours?
 
**Barghest:**
No. There is only one of Her Majesty. And she is not a Servant.
 
**Barghest:**
She is without a doubt a fairy. After two hundred years of service, I can assure you of that.
 
**Barghest:**
That is why I wanted to ask you. That man from pan-human history...
 
**Barghest:**
Is Beryl Gut truly Her Majesty's Master?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**???:**
&mdash;Situational changes have been confirmed. The toll has been paid.
 
**???:**
I propose to you thus, the chosen; and present to you thus, the discarded.
 
**???:**
If you desire glory, choose revival. If you desire idleness, choose eternal sleep.
 
**???:**
It is all the same to a god.
 
**Narration:**
All the same, eh? Cruel to put life and death on those terms.
 
**Narration:**
Being alive means a lot of work. Being dead means no more troubles.
 
**Narration:**
I like keeping everything simple. Extra baggage stops you from carrying on the way you want.
 
**Narration:**
Glory or power, the future of mankind, or just wanting to be a good person...
 
**Narration:**
I'm not special enough to get stressed out over all that.
 
**Beryl:**
Hey, Alien God, mate. I've got one question for you to answer.
 
**Narration:**
I asked if there were any “things” in that world which I would find important.
 
**Narration:**
There was an immediate answer, as expected of a god.
 
**Beryl:**
Hey, Kirschtaria!! You came back to life too, mate!
 
**Beryl:**
Man, that's a relief. I was sure I'd be up first!
 
**Beryl:**
I mean, this Alien God stuff? Talking about negating human history?
 
**Beryl:**
All that'd only be music for the ears of me, Peperoncino, or Daybit, right?
 
**Kirschtaria:**
Not necessarily. I'm just as greedy as anyone else.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
Creating a new history for mankind is a very tempting proposition. I'd be mad to turn it down.
 
**Beryl:**
No shit? You're showing your true colors, Wodime!
 
**Beryl:**
But you were always the type who'd say the most outlandish things.
 
**Beryl:**
You've got a much better smile on your face now, really. That gets me right in the heart.
 
**Beryl:**
“I'm gonna be king of the earth, and leave humanity to perish.”
 
**Beryl:**
When you're buckling from the pressure of playing the nice guy is exactly when to decide what to do with yourself.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
Hm. Has your impression of me changed that much?
 
**Beryl:**
No, and that's what makes me glad! I mean, you were already a madman before.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
Well...I came to realize that everyone in Team A had misunderstood me in different ways.
 
**Beryl:**
Hah? Don't be so down. You're making a good impression on me now.
 
**Beryl:**
So Wodime, what do you have in mind for me? You're the team leader.
 
**Beryl:**
I'm finally getting the hang of things. This is what being one who conceals—a Crypter—is all about, right?
 
**Kirschtaria:**
Well, you were chosen for emergencies during the Singularity reparation mission.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
And you were made aware of the secret details regarding the Great Command Spell, the Sirius Light, like how to force it to take effect.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
The singularities that were to eventually appear were theorized to be seven key points in human history.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
And the Sirius Lights were the decisive factor for preserving the human order.
 
**Beryl:**
...That was a secret between me and Marisbury, but I guess you've been clued in too now.
 
**Beryl:**
Did the Alien God fill you in? It's really piling more trouble on me.
 
**Beryl:**
So, what's your move? Like you figured, I'm the hired gun who cleans up traitors to the cause.
 
**Beryl:**
Am I to be quietly killed off to keep teamwork copacetic?
 
**Kirschtaria:**
No, I'd like to hire your ruthlessness. Everyone on Team A will eventually be revived.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
And each of us assigned to a “Lostbelt”.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
Then, the Alien God will hand us each a ticket to become king of the world, provided we cultivate a “Fantasy Tree”...
 
**Kirschtaria:**
I want you to tear up this ticket of yours. It's given in bad faith anyways, so why keep it?
 
**Kirschtaria:**
But keep that a secret. Discreetly maintain a facade that you're still trying to succeed.
 
**Beryl:**
Wait, hold on. You want me to screw over the Alien God?
 
**Beryl:**
After discarding my ticket to rule the world?
 
**Kirschtaria:**
You'll be in charge of the isle of Britain. I chose for you in advance. It's your homeland, isn't it?
 
**Beryl:**
Don't you think you're asking too much? Not even Marisbury took charge to this extent.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
Is that so? Well, there's no turning back now that I've filled you in on this much.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
If you refuse, I'm afraid you'll have to die here...
 
**Beryl:**
Not exactly fair. It's not like I have any choice.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
Thank you for your consent, Beryl. You're the only one I could turn to for this.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
I don't know the current state of Britain's Lostbelt, but the land is a cornerstone for the world of magecraft.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
There's no predicting what will happen if the Alien God moves to inhabit something from that island.
 
**Kirschtaria:**
I'd like to nip the Lostbelt in the bud before it can grow to maturity. The details will be up to you, but in short...
 
**Beryl:**
You want your hands kept as clean as ever. Okay, roger that.
 
**Beryl:**
Hey, I wasn't that interested in a race to be king of the earth to begin with. This could be much more fun!
 
**Beryl:**
Nevertheless, we have a deal. Don't forget my compensation, Wodime.
 
**Beryl:**
After you become king of the earth, I get my fill of the spoils, okay?
 
**Beryl:**
Man, there's really not a damn thing here!
 
**Beryl:**
Sure, you got phantasmal beasts and fairies and other dangerous crap prowling around as they see fit.
 
**Beryl:**
But this is supposed to be a threat to his “new human history”? I have no idea how Wodime read the situation.
 
**Beryl:**
...No, his face was dead certain.
 
**Beryl:**
Did he have some way unknown to us of knowing London was gonna be bad news?
 
**Beryl:**
All the same, it just makes my job easier!
 
**Beryl:**
I can get rid of the Fantasy Tree without any real opposition.
 
**Beryl:**
And to that end, I guess I'll summon a Servant.
 
**Beryl:**
Much obliged, Marisbury. We Crypters have a guarantee to summon one Servant of our choice.
 
**Beryl:**
The Sirius Light is a pretty bitchin' thing to be marked with. No sense not making use of it.
 
**Beryl:**
Only question is, what kind of Servant to call forth?
 
**Beryl:**
Heh, that's obvious enough.
 
**Beryl:**
I've only got one condition here. If need be, I want someone who can demolish this world.
 
**D：Servant:**
Ruler Servant, Fairy Queen Morgan, has answered your summons.
 
**D：Servant:**
Heir to the witches of the end. Are you my Master?
 
**Beryl:**
Man, I slept great! It was a good decision to stop here before heading back to Darlington!
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
Oops, my darling consort must have more pressing business alone on her throne.
 
**Beryl:**
Still, Morgan, aren't you taking things too seriously here?
 
**Beryl:**
The Fantasy Tree has withered, and our greatest enemy, Kirschtaria, lies dead.
 
**Beryl:**
The Alien God failed to take the vessel it wanted.
 
**Beryl:**
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore. We're going to win this thing.
 
**Beryl:**
So why don't you relax already? Chaldea and the Child of Prophecy are no match for you, are they?
 
**Morgan:**
Meaningless. I never recognized them as enemies to begin with.
 
**Morgan:**
The humans who once expelled me, and the isle of Britain which denies me my Fairy Kingdom...
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Pan-human history itself, so to speak, is my enemy. There is no time to yield the throne until it has been overthrown.
 
**Morgan:**
Beryl Gut. I hold you responsible for Baobhan Sith's disgrace at Gloucester.
 
**Morgan:**
If you cannot even babysit one child, I shall have to reconsider your treatment as my husband and standing as my Master.
 
**Morgan:**
Inform Baobhan Sith that she will have no more chances.
 
**Morgan:**
I have overindulged her. As the queen's daughter, it is time she learns some dignity.
 
**Beryl:**
But of course, she'd be happy to hear that from you. But it's a lost cause, isn't it?
 
**Beryl:**
You don't love anyone, do you? Even keeping a successor is unfathomable.
 
**Beryl:**
Bloody hell&mdash;Baobhan Sith is yet another horrible woman I'm stuck with.
 
## Fragment / 8 
 
**Narration:**
Since the discovery in the depths of the Great Pit, Mash and Tonelico began investigating ruins in various parts of Britain.
 
**Narration:**
Solely guided by the legends passed down by the Mirror Clan and murals left behind by the Rain Clan.
 
**Narration:**
With that came a grand adventure searching east to west for books left behind by humans!
 
**Narration:**
They encountered Mors, and were attacked by the anti-Londinium fairies.
 
**Narration:**
And they ran into trouble fighting a big monster because of Tonelico's whims.
 
**Narration:**
But it's all good memories now that it's over, since Mash carried herself so well and looked so cool!
 
**Totrot:**
Hey Mash, didn't you call me a funny name when we first met?
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes. Um, I said...
 
**Mash:**
You looked like someone I'd met before, Totrot. So I just made a mistake! I'm sorry!
 
**Totrot:**
Someone just like me? I'm shocked! What's she like?
 
**Mash:**
I only spent a short time with her, but she's a very wonderful person.
 
**Mash:**
She was brave, dependable, and kind. And she fashioned a lot of clothes in her workshop.
 
**Mash:**
Her name is Habetrot. She's the fairy of happiness who sends off brides.
 
**Totrot:**
&mdash;I didn't know the future had someone like that! But you're right, the name is pretty similar.
 
**Totrot:**
Maybe she's using a pseudonym just like Tonelico is! True Name Concealment!
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
That will do, Mash. You promised not to say too much, remember?
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry...I just wanted Totrot to be happy...
 
**Totrot:**
I-I see. Your intentions were good. Sorry.
 
**Totrot:**
Still...
 
**Totrot:**
Sending off brides is a great thing! I wish I could live like that!
 
**Narration:**
Well, let's just make a note of that conversation.
 
**Narration:**
Their adventure to uncover the secrets of the ruins lasted five months.
 
**Narration:**
None of it amounted to anything, but the two patiently worked their way back through Britain's history.
 
**Narration:**
And so, they arrived at the “Priestess' Prophecy”.
 
**Narration:**
The first “prophecy of ruin” uttered in Britain. A curse left by the first human, the priestess of a forgotten god.
 
**Narration:**
She predicted a spring, summer, fall and winter war. But the Winter War hadn't happened yet.
 
**Narration:**
In the end, I still have no idea what it refers to.
 
**Narration:**
The only things we took away from the investigation were fun memories.
 
**Narration:**
I've written this many times to the point of irritation, but the year is 400 of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Narration:**
The coronation at Londinium, which will decide Britain's destiny, is only a few days away.
 
**Narration:**
It's time for the leading lady, Tonelico, to return to the castle.
 
**Totrot:**
Sewing is done, hurray! Now we just need an embroidered motif!
 
**Totrot:**
Purple roses for Tonelico and blue for Mash will do nicely!
 
**Black Knight:**
Let's see...hmm, well done. I find no fault in this.
 
**Black Knight:**
To think our crybaby Totrot would master this so quickly. Crafts are truly fascinating.
 
**Black Knight:**
And are you embroidering a decoration on the chest area?
 
**Black Knight:**
Tonelico is to be our queen, so let's go with something lustrous. Sew a selection of beads to create the pattern of the World Tree.
 
**Black Knight:**
Give it here. Like this.
 
**Totrot:**
Woah, what's with your hands' dexterity? Were you once a maiden, Black Knight?
 
**Tonelico:**
Totrot has completely changed, hasn't she? It's thanks to you, Mash.
 
**Tonelico:**
We've been together for centuries, and I never knew she had that side to her.
 
**Tonelico:**
It's really no good. All I've known is fighting. I never even noticed how my friends who supported me suffered.
 
**Mash:**
No, I only acted in the moment.
 
**Mash:**
It's the coronation that has moved Totrot to embrace her sewing.
 
**Mash:**
She said she'd make a dress fine enough for the greatest fairy in Britain.
 
**Mash:**
So I'm sure that she would've become a great tailor even without me.
 
**Tonelico:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Tonelico...?
 
**Tonelico:**
...Alright. Let's talk about my true feelings for a moment.
 
**Tonelico:**
Mash, I'm not the Savior I've been made out to be. I just want to preserve the Britain I know.
 
**Tonelico:**
I'm not going to try and save every fairy anymore. And I don't want to protect the humans either.
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Huh?&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
But you've managed to protect them so far. Why the change of heart?
 
**Tonelico:**
That may be true...
 
**Tonelico:**
For 3,600 years, I've cleansed the Calamity every century and the Great Calamity each millennia.
 
**Tonelico:**
I said before that I sleep in a coffin, leaving what comes after to the fairies.
 
**Tonelico:**
That's not the case. Every time...every time, I'm hunted and persecuted after the fact by the fairies.
 
**Tonelico:**
There was never a time I could be at peace. Each time, I had to run and resume sleeping.
 
**Tonelico:**
In the beginning, I must have had the desire to build a land of ideals.
 
**Tonelico:**
But all that is gone now.
 
**Tonelico:**
If you work twice as hard and resolve to do better next time, you get twice as many stones thrown at you.
 
**Tonelico:**
Imprisonment, crucifixion, beheading, drowning, immolation. Poisoning is about the only thing remaining on the list.
 
**Tonelico:**
So I've stopped holding out any hope for the fairies.
 
**Tonelico:**
My only companions are Totrot, the Black Knight, and Wryneck. As for Uther...it's too soon to say.
 
**Tonelico:**
They're no different than “important tools” to me.
 
**Tonelico:**
I will protect Britain only for my own sake, because this is the only place I belong.
 
**Tonelico:**
To this end, I will unite the fairies and give humans the right to build their own kingdom.
 
**Tonelico:**
That's the kind of Britain I seek. It's a story not permitted in pan-human history.
 
**Tonelico:**
I am Tonelico, the witch. I was never a savior to begin with.
 
**Mash:**
But...even then, not one of them was there for you?
 
**Mash:**
A fairy who believed in you? Who understood you?
 
**Mash:**
There wasn't a single fairy you'd want to save?
 
**Tonelico:**
No, not one. That's why we're in this mess.
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Tonelico:**
Mash. I don't know by what kind of power, or by whom, you were sent from the Queen's Calendar...
 
**Tonelico:**
Since if I knew, it would affect the future.
 
**Tonelico:**
I keep wavering between whether I should be their destroyer or savior...
 
**Tonelico:**
That doesn't really mean anything now. This is the Fairy Calendar, the history of the Fantasy Tree.
 
**Tonelico:**
As long as that tree remains, it doesn't change that anything can happen in the Lostbelt.
 
**Tonelico:**
Each time an element is added, history will adjust in real time.
 
**Tonelico:**
The world with the Fantasy Tree doesn't have to keep consistent.
 
**Tonelico:**
Morgan used the Water Mirror to send a Calamity to the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
Because, no matter how the Fairy Calendar's history changes as a result, the certain beginning of the Queen's Calendar has already been set in stone.
 
**Mash:**
A world with a Fantasy Tree allows for a certain amount of discrepancy...is that what you mean?
 
**Tonelico:**
Yes, that's why I'm here. It's fine to be vague as far as the Fairy Calendar goes.
 
**Tonelico:**
When you mentioned the Queen's Calendar, I had an inkling of what the future holds.
 
**Tonelico:**
“Oh, all the magic energy in the Fantasy Tree may have been used to change a Lostbelt into a Singularity.”
 
**Tonelico:**
I won't know the purpose for such a choice until the time comes.
 
**Tonelico:**
But Mash, you can only exist until the end of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
Whether you are alive or dead, you will cease to exist in 400 years once the Queen's Calendar comes to be.
 
**Tonelico:**
You also understand that, don't you?
 
**Mash:**
Yes...in the year 2017 of the Queen's Calendar, I came to Britain.
 
**Mash:**
Since I didn't exist there prior to that, it may be that when the Fantasy Tree withers...
 
**Tonelico:**
Honestly, no matter how flexible the Fairy Calendar is in regards to being modified...
 
**Tonelico:**
How does one come up with the crazy idea of sending your unsolvable problems to die off here?
 
**Tonelico:**
And on top of that, it's not a Calamity, but a lone Servant that's sent for disposal.
 
**Tonelico:**
That's disgraceful beyond words.
 
**Tonelico:**
So I'll return fire.
 
**Tonelico:**
It's the responsibility of all those concerned to send you back to the future where you belong.
 
**Mash:**
A-are you sure? More importantly, is that possible?
 
**Tonelico:**
Hmm, it might be.
 
**Tonelico:**
As long as history doesn't face any contradiction before the Norwich Calamity of 2017 in the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
How do you feel about being locked away in the furthest reaches where no one will find you?
 
## Section 18: Albion

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's the Fantasy Tree. This is the Lake District!|
 
**Da Vinci:**
You can clearly see its size on the other side of the river. It's much larger compared to those we've seen already.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Here in Britain, it withered 2,000 years ago. And then, a few months ago...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Morgan set it on fire in order to do the same to the Fantasy Tree in Olympus?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is the Lake District a real part of England?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course. It's no exaggeration to call it one of England's best tourist destinations.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Gentle glacial lakes, and plateaus with harsh yet pristine rock faces.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Unlike the more developed urban areas, the countryside has remained unchanged for centuries.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fancy clothes, food, and entertainment are good and all, but passing the time here is the greatest luxury.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(Hey, Fujimaru, the girl's not looking well. Something must be up.)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is this your first time here, Artoria?|
 
**Artoria:**
Huh? Oh, yes. I thought the Lake District would be like this.
 
**Artoria:**
The view is as beautiful as I'd heard! Quiet, followed by more quiet!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Man, is she bad at dodging questions...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's a bit lonely without Oberon.
 
**Artoria:**
That's true...in times like this, Oberon would be quashing our fears ahead of time...
 
**Artoria:**
I can tell he's also living a thankless life.
 
**Artoria:**
He focuses so much on everyone around him, that he never has any time for himself.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, but we're not talking about Lord Obbey here.
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You're still worried about what Barghest said, aren't you? Wouldn't it be better to just be out with it instead of worrying all by yourself?
 
**Da Vinci:**
“Is Beryl really Morgan's Master?” That's a big question, but more to the point...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Everything else relies on if Morgan herself is a servant or not.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I admit that the contradiction has me at my wit's end.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Both Fujimaru and I had to revise our knowledge again and again since arriving in this world.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
At first, I thought that Morgan was the Lostbelt King.|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yep. If she's been ruling the Fairy Kingdom for 2,000 years, she can't be anything but the Lostbelt King.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But then we met Morgan and Beryl at Camelot...|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Beryl called himself her Master, and she didn't deny it... did she?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Morgan ain't Beryl's Servant, yet Beryl is Morgan's Master&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's an enigma I can't help with. Can't you work out a hypothesis, Da Vinci?
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's way too little intel to work with.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If Holmes were here, he'd be linking inferences from his reasoning to form a deduction of his own.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's got me worried. Artoria, how about you?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
There is one thing...maybe. I've heard you explain the Servant and Master system,
 
**Artoria:**
and plenty more regarding what Chaldea's been doing, but...
 
**Artoria:**
Look...I don't want to think about this anymore. If that were all true, then there's simply no way&mdash;
 
**Habetrot:**
There's no way we can defeat her. Or rather, you don't even want to fight a fairy like that, am I right?
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Habetrot?
 
**Habetrot:**
It's okay if you don't want to put up a fight. Is there any need to go on the offensive?
 
**Habetrot:**
Chaldea's goal is Morgan's Rhongomyniad. The Child of Prophecy's is to ring the six bells.
 
**Habetrot:**
I heard Ainsel's song about the Child of Prophecy a bunch of times in Londinium.
 
**Habetrot:**
There's nothing in it that says you have to to slay the Queen.
 
**Artoria:**
But she herself said: “defeat me.”
 
**Habetrot:**
I guess she did.
 
**Habetrot:**
No sense trusting anything after that hooey. She just wants everyone else to be her enemy.
 
**Habetrot:**
Still, my only interest is in reuniting Mash and Fujimaru. So I'll leave it at that.
 
**Habetrot:**
You'll suffocate from trying to meet the expectations of everyone around you. Sometimes you gotta say “I don't care, stupid!”
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
&mdash;Enough chit-chat. A bunch of Mors are coming right for us.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You remember Barghest's advice, Fujimaru? Well, good.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No more being sloppy. From here on out, you're the center of our formation!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That last one seemed weird...|
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah. She's around here somewhere. Is she on vacation or something?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Mors really are getting stronger...
 
**Habetrot:**
The fairies they were formed from were pretty strong. This land used to be sacred to the northern fairies.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
It'll take us a whole day to make it through the Lake District and reach the northern shore.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We're about halfway there. Let's look for a forest to set up camp before the sun goes down.
 
**Da Vinci:**
By the way, are you familiar with this area, Habetrot? You're from up north, aren't you?
 
**Habetrot:**
Well, I guess.
 
**Habetrot:**
I'm more familiar with this place because it hasn't changed as much as the south has.
 
**Habetrot:**
Why, Da Vinci? You want a Habenyan History Lesson?
 
**Da Vinci:**
We didn't hear much about the Lake District in the south. It'd be a big help if you would be so kind as to indulge us.
 
**Habetrot:**
Alright then, but only until the sun sets!
 
**Habetrot:**
A long time ago, Britain used to be much smaller. Everything you see now was underwater.
 
**Habetrot:**
In all the world, Britain was the only land. At least, that's what the fairies thought as they moved to expand the island.
 
**Habetrot:**
Once they reached the point where Manchester lies now, they came to notice a forest on a shore opposite.
 
**Habetrot:**
What they saw was this place, the Lake District of the British Lostbelt. A forest sprung from the middle of the sea.
 
**Habetrot:**
And the ones who prospered thanks to that forest's blessings were none other than the northern fairies.
 
**Artoria:**
The northern fairies...wait, you mean Knocknarea's ancestors!?
 
**Habetrot:**
Yep. The six clans and the northern fairies are of different lineages.
 
**Habetrot:**
This was the year 6000 of the Fairy Calendar. That would be...about 8,000 years ago now.
 
**Habetrot:**
It was here that Britain's first war erupted. A battle between the fairies of the north and south.
 
**Habetrot:**
Nowadays, it's just known as the “Spring War.”
 
**Habetrot:**
The northern fairies envied the lands of the southern ones, so they crossed the sea and invaded their land.
 
**Habetrot:**
But, clan heads aside, the southern fairies were individually much stronger than those of the north.
 
**Habetrot:**
Back then, there were no humans among the northern fairies. They could only be found in the south.
 
**Habetrot:**
Consequently, the war ended with the victory of the southern fairies. It is said to have been a complete massacre.
 
**Habetrot:**
After all, any new generation of northern fairies that appeared was killed on the spot.
 
**Habetrot:**
Their bodies&mdash;those fallen trees filled the sea all the way to the Lake District.
 
**Habetrot:**
And so, the northern fairies were slain to the point that no new generation of them would ever come to be.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So what happened to them after that?|
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
They went extinct...or so everybody thought. Yet they're alive and well today.
 
**Habetrot:**
Their chief was a far more impressive fairy than any who led the six clans.
 
**Habetrot:**
Though, they weren't the “six clans” back then.
 
**Habetrot:**
After she escaped, the Queen of the North abandoned the Lake District and created the Western Island, alone in the Sea of Emptiness.
 
**Habetrot:**
The Western Island...Ireland has become something of a legend, “unseen but existing”.
 
**Habetrot:**
It became the final hope of the fairies sentenced to exile from Britain.
 
**Habetrot:**
Following that, the north and south clashed once again in the Summer War,
 
**Habetrot:**
but that has nothing to do with the Lake District, so we'll just forget about it.
 
**Habetrot:**
After that first battle, the Spring War,
 
**Habetrot:**
the southern fairies took over the Lake District and developed it further.
 
**Habetrot:**
Eventually, this became the home of the Mirror Clan. And in the northernmost part lived the Rain Clan.
 
**Habetrot:**
Both built their capitals here and prospered. As you can see, however, they eventually fell into ruin.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You don't say!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, if you look at it from the outside, it's weird for a country to last more than 1,000 years, isn't it?
 
**Habetrot:**
Morgan's Fairy Kingdom has endured for over 2,000 years, hasn't it? Well, I don't know if I'd call it thriving since they're not exactly making any progress.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Rain Clan...I see, Britain's sky is always twilit, but it rains...
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's only natural there would be fairies who control the weather.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But how did the Rain Clan die out? Was it a natural occurrence?
 
**Habetrot:**
They...well, I'll tell you once we get to Orkney.
 
**Habetrot:**
Either way, they died off along with their capital. That was in the year 4000 of the Fairy Calendar.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
About 6,000 years ago now.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
2,000 years after the Spring War?
 
**Habetrot:**
Yeah. Their capital was built in the year 5000 of the Fairy Calendar, so it remained Britain's foremost city for a millennium.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
I get it...so that's why Ireland is nowhere to be found...
 
**Da Vinci:**
The northern fairies have to be Irish.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And the only one of them to survive the Spring War was their Queen...
 
**Da Vinci:**
But the Western Island is gone. What does that mean?
 
**Habetrot:**
Isn't it obvious? The northern fairies all moved back to Britain!
 
**Habetrot:**
The island was made so that Mab could protect her people, and following that, she invaded in order to return the entire island to herself!
 
**Habetrot:**
That was the Summer War, when the savior Tonelico and the first Fairy Knight were active, back in the year 2000 of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Habetrot:**
The northern fairies' leader, Queen Mab, was really strong!
 
**Habetrot:**
Since the failure of the Spring War, she had coexisted with humans on the Western Island for 4,000 years.
 
**Habetrot:**
The southern fairies saw humans as nothing more than “tools who give us entertainment,”
 
**Habetrot:**
but the northern fairies built their civilization with them as partners.
 
**Habetrot:**
The southern fairies had numbers on their side, but the difference in strength was obvious.
 
**Habetrot:**
Queen Mab was of a mind to wipe out all the southern fairies in revenge for the Spring War,
 
**Habetrot:**
but Tonelico showed up to mediate, and peace was achieved.
 
**Habetrot:**
Because of that, the northern fairies were welcomed as the King's Clan, and claimed the northern part of Britain as their territory.
 
**Habetrot:**
That's when the six clans you're all familiar with came to be. You know what happened next.
 
**Habetrot:**
The reason the northern and southern fairies have such bad relations even after the switch to the Queen's Calendar is because of all that.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see. Fairy history...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is all a little over my head...
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
All you need to remember is that the clans were killing each other in the latter half of the Fairy Calendar... right before the switch to the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Do you know of anything related to 14,000 years ago... the beginning of the Fairy Calendar?
 
**Habetrot:**
I don't. There shouldn't be any records left related to the time of creation.
 
**Habetrot:**
Tonelico and the first Fairy Knight tried their absolute best to find some, but all they found out was the story of the “six fairies.”
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
By six fairies, you mean...|
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
You catch on quick. Yeah, it's the story of that mural.
 
**Habetrot:**
I only vaguely remember it, but if that's good enough, I'll tell you before you go to sleep.
 
**Habetrot:**
It's better suited as a bedtime story anyway!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, this place is perfect! Everyone~! That's it for today~! Let's set up camp!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right, I'll get some water!|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
All right, I'll pitch the tent!
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I'll head up the mountain to gather some wood... or maybe, I'll just gather firewood from around here instead.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'll submit a report to the Border!
 
**Habetrot:**
I'm tired, so I'm just gonna lie here!
 
**Artoria:**
Then, I'll set up a bounded field to ward off beasts and insects!
 
**Artoria:**
Setting up camp is fun no matter where you are!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You bet! All hands on deck!|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whew...that hit the spot...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now to get some sleep for tomorrow...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, I think we should hit the hay. I don't think there are any dangerous creatures in this forest, so&mdash;
 
**Habetrot:**
Wait! I promised to tell you about the “six fairies”!
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, right...! Sorry, Habenyan, go ahead!
 
**Artoria:**
Don't worry, I'll listen. This is an important story after all.
 
**Habetrot:**
Ahem. Let's see, where was that...aha, here. Page 153 of History According to Habenyan.
 
**Habetrot:**
“At the end was the sea. At the beginning was the sea.”
 
**Habetrot:**
“As the falling star passed, all the earth became a stream...”
 
**Narration:**
This is a story from long, long ago.
 
**Narration:**
When the six fairies went outside, they found the whole world had turned into an ocean.
 
**Narration:**
There was no dirt and no rocks, no fish and no birds.
 
**Narration:**
Naturally, the mountains and forests that they loved so much were also gone.
 
**Narration:**
The six fairies were so distressed, they thought about going back.
 
**Narration:**
“I'm sorry you had to face this, and I'm sorry things are this way.”
 
**Narration:**
Just then, a tremendous shadow arose from the sea.
 
**Narration:**
It was a huge body covered in fluffy, bushy hair.
 
**Narration:**
On its shoulder sat an animal that should have no longer existed.
 
**Narration:**
The animal called the fluffy thing “Cernunnos.”
 
**Narration:**
Cernunnos and the animal made friends with the six fairies.
 
**Narration:**
The empty sea was boring, and difficult to live in,
 
**Narration:**
but Cernunnos held back the waves so that the six fairies could live in comfort.
 
**Narration:**
However, because Cernunnos was a god, the animal said he needed offerings.
 
**Narration:**
The six fairies gave their joy to Cernunnos.
 
**Narration:**
The six fairies gave their pleas to Cernunnos.
 
**Narration:**
“The ocean without waves is nice, but we still miss the land!”
 
**Narration:**
Their wish was granted.
 
**Narration:**
The festival came to an end.
 
**Narration:**
The god grew tired and went to sleep.
 
**Narration:**
The six fairies revered Cernunnos,
 
**Narration:**
and treasured what he left behind.
 
**Narration:**
That was how Britain came to be. Salvation upon the original six.
 
**Habetrot:**
And that's the end. What do you think? You learn anything, Artor&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
...wow...wow, Habenyan...I learned a lot...good for you...
 
**Habetrot:**
She's talking in her sleep...? Is she pretending to listen...?
 
**Habetrot:**
Everyone else too!? Muramasa, Da Vinci, Fujimaru!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's alright...I'm sleep...studying...|
 
**Habetrot:**
You can't learn anything in your dreams!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's fine, I'm still up.
 
**Habetrot:**
Good! Patience is a virtue for finding that special someone!
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
But that was really informative.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Not just about the ancestors of the six clans, but that giant beast on the mural...seems like Cernunnos was real after all.
 
**Da Vinci:**
What do you think the “animal” riding on Cernunnos was?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If it was a fairy, the story would have said so...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...could it have been a human?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I think so too. A god needs a spokesman, after all. Most likely, that “human” was Cernunnos' priestess.
 
**Da Vinci:**
They were probably akin to some form of medium, conveying the god's words to the people.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I see. So you had gods, priestesses, and fairies all together at Britain's creation.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
And now there are neither gods nor priestesses. Only fairies, and humans fashioned by them...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
There's more to this. Could this place be what Morgan's trying to keep hidden?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Maybe. Once they switched to the Queen's calendar, oral traditions of “god” completely disappeared.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I've got one more question, though.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The south...the ancestors of the six clans were gifted the land by Cernunnos...so it seems.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So who made this forest in the Lake District, the land of the northern fairies?
 
**Habetrot:**
Oh, I know the answer to that.
 
**Habetrot:**
The fairies born during the Queen's Calendar don't know this, and it was a secret kept by the Mirror Clan...
 
**Habetrot:**
But there's the corpse of a creature hidden in the Lake District.
 
**Habetrot:**
It didn't matter that the world turned into a lifeless sea and started anew,
 
**Habetrot:**
it's the one thing that didn't decompose, and eventually it grew into this forest.
 
**Habetrot:**
Albion of the Boundary. Last of the dragons.
 
**Habetrot:**
The land of the northern fairies was formed from the remains of the dragon that failed to return to Paradise—to Avalon.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...and that's all from last night.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Thanks, Fujimaru...and sorry I dozed off last night, Habenyan.
 
**Habetrot:**
It's fine, I don't care anymore. You said “it's fine even if it's a bedtime story” yourself anyway.
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah! Thanks to that I slept really well! I haven't dreamt like that in a loooong time!
 
**Artoria:**
So how awesome is this “Albion” thing, exactly?
 
**Da Vinci:**
In pan-human history archaeology, it's the name given to Britain by a prehistoric civilization,
 
**Da Vinci:**
and in the world of magic, it's known as the “Age of Gods' Dragon” or the “last pure-blooded dragon.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
If you're asking how awesome something like that is... how can I put this...
 
**Da Vinci:**
You could say a Servant, a Heroic Spirit, is a being that stands at the pinnacle of humanity in terms of spiritual power,
 
**Da Vinci:**
but Servants can be ranked according to the “scale of their Saint Graphs”.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Superhuman even by Heroic Spirit standards. The special of the specials, if you would.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We call those Grands, so Albion is like the Grand of dragons...I guess?
 
**Da Vinci:**
If it's been around since the creation of the Earth, it's probably accumulated 4.6 billion years worth of knowledge.
 
**Da Vinci:**
A primordial super-being, different from gods shaped by human cognition and discovered through religion.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But humans are pretty special too, you know?
 
**Da Vinci:**
It only took them a few hundred thousand years to analyze, learn, and extrapolate what it took 4.6 billion years to accumulate.
 
**Da Vinci:**
As a single life form there's no contest, but as a species, humanity is the clear victor.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Looks like the “strongest being on Earth” is all talk, huh?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You said it! I can always count on you for that, even if you're my enemy!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Always glad to be of help. Glad to have you too, even if we're not on the same side.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What an odd friendship...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
They still see each other as enemies...how strange...
 
**???:**
I know. Men have always been like that, haven't they?
 
**Everyone else:**
!?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
Alright, stop right there! You're the fairy that's been following us since yesterday, aren't you?
 
**Mira:**
You betcha. I'm Mira the Nightcall! Hey there!
 
**Mira:**
I got a good feeling from the aura you guys put out, so I was just observing you!
 
**Da Vinci:**
By the way, I used to be a guy too, so could you not discriminate based on our sexes?
 
**Artoria:**
A Fairy Deadlord is a wraith who doesn't disappear after they die! But this one doesn't seem to be malicious or harmful?
 
**Mira:**
Yeah. I don't have any lingering regrets or resentments. My being is just too heavily concentrated to dissipate.
 
**Mira:**
It's kind of a pain for me as well. Even after all these years, I'm still here.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Uh, yeah, that's rough. Well, if you have a grave, how about we leave an offering of food?
 
**Mira:**
You put food on gravesites? But there's nothing in them. Weeeird.
 
**Mira:**
Thanks, though! You guys are good fairies!
 
**Habetrot:**
Well, aren't you a cheery Nightcall? Seems like you certainly didn't die of losing your purpose.
 
**Habetrot:**
Was it a sudden death? Did you lose your life in some unfortunate accident?
 
**Mira:**
It wasn't an accident, but an incident. We were all massacred six years ago.
 
**Mira:**
Chief Ainsel of the Mirror Clan predicted the future, where we were destroyed with “fire” and “wind”.
 
**Mira:**
Ainsel died back then, too. There should be none of the Mirror Clan left.
 
**Mira:**
At least...that should be the case...but isn't it strange? Well, I guess things like this happen sometimes!
 
**Artoria:**
...?
 
**Mira:**
Anyway, I have a small request for you guys. I think it'll be fun for you.
 
**Mira:**
We've been protecting this place, but a few days ago this weirdo showed up,
 
**Mira:**
and now they're just living here. Could you get rid of them, please?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm more than willing to do a favor for a fairy in need... or a Nightcall, I guess...
 
**Da Vinci:**
But we're in a hurry too...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Just out of curiosity, what kind of person is this weirdo that's living here?
 
**Mira:**
Well, she's wearing a dress like some kind of fairy noble, she's got what looks like glasses on,
 
**Mira:**
she's got a bunch of minions, and a pink tail, I think?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Wait a second. You don't think...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Tamamovitch Koyanskaya...!|
 

---

 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
Koyanskaya was the Servant who was with Muryan, right?
 
**Artoria:**
Oberon deemed her a threat, but is she someone Chaldea can't afford to leave alone?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Honestly, in a place like this...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not too sure...
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
She definitely stands on the opposite side of humanity. But we've never directly confronted her up until now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Her attack on Chaldea's base was clearly hostile, but was probably carried out under orders from the Alien God.
 
**Da Vinci:**
She's toyed with the humans in each Lostbelt, but that was probably her own form of retribution.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It was an extension of the exploitation that takes place between people in each world. A caricature of the relationship between the ruling class and the proletariat.
 
**Da Vinci:**
She hates humanity, but won't destroy it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
The fact that she's been going around Lostbelts collecting creatures that don't exist in pan-human history,
 
**Da Vinci:**
and that she's a juvenile Beast&ndash;a humanity-destroying evil&ndash;is a clear indication she's bad news.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If Koyanskaya is just playing around as Muryan's bodyguard, then that's her business. We can't interfere.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But if she's “collecting” here in Britain as well, we can't ignore her.
 
**Da Vinci:**
After all, she'll eventually turn it all on us! It's in our own interest to stop her while we can!
 
**Artoria:**
Uh, I see. I guess she's a dangerous opponent then.
 
**Artoria:**
So she came here for...
 
**Artoria:**
Mira, she's heading for the Dragon Husk Swamp now, right?
 
**Mira:**
That's right! She's heading for the dark swamp nobody should know of, carrying a fluffy umbrella!
 
**Mira:**
She also kicked out all the Mors, and is doing bad things to the dragon corpse!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Dragon corpse&mdash;Albion! That bitch, she's always trying to get her hands on these rarities!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
If it's been around for that long, it's an important piece of cultural heritage! Tourists shouldn't be messing with it!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's hurry!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That would give pan-human history a bad name!
 

---

 
**Mira:**
Mors, Mors~~! So many Mors~!
 
**Mira:**
Sorry, you should all run away~! Your lives are more important~! Please give up on the dragon's corpse and get out of here!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, luckily, not many of us are actual fairies! A few Mors are no issue!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, you stand back, Habetrot! Just in case!
 
**Habetrot:**
Don't give me that! Their poison is pretty strong!
 
**Habetrot:**
Fujimaru, prepare the recovery team! I'll get this done, whatever it takes!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It was hard enough with just three, and they keep multiplying...!|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
This feels intentional! There's no way this many would group up just for some fairies!
 
**Da Vinci:**
This is probably Koyanskaya's trap! She really doesn't want us to go any further!
 
**Artoria:**
She can control the Mors!? Is she that dangerous!?
 
**Artoria:**
I mean, if you've dealt with this up till now,
 
**Artoria:**
how could you just greet her like, “Hey there” in Gloucester, Fujimaru!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're right about that.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't think that's how it went, exactly.
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We had no choice, Muryan was there! Quit your yapping and focus on the Mors!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We'll have to keep firing off our Noble Phantasms until we're out of juice! Artoria, counting on you for enchantments!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I've got no choice but to burn out my Saint Graph with three slashes from Tsumukari!
 
**Artoria:**
Whaaaat!? Servants can burn their Saint Graphs, Muramasa!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
&mdash;Well, I don't have anything else, so here goes!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Don't worry about it, come on! After all those years standing in a forge, you're bound to lose a limb or two!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fairy Knight Lancelot!? What's she doing here!?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I don't care what you're doing here, but I'm mopping up the Mors! Get out of the way, Child of Prophecy!
 
**Mira:**
(No way, that girl's the Child of Prophecy!? I didn't quite recognize her since I became a Fairy Deadlord, but...)
 
**Mira:**
(Yeah, that's right! I can feel it! I can finally return to Paradise!)
 
**Mira:**
(It's happening...it's really happening...we finally achieved our goal...)
 
**Mira:**
(Hail, bells that toll for Britain's end. The second Avalon le Fae, on her noble mission!)
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No casualties confirmed... Well, it's of no relevance to me.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(She exterminated all the Mors on her own...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(To fire Noble Phantasms successively like that...)
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
It's not like...you meant to save us, right?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I suppose not...I could have simply let you be...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But this place is special to me. I didn't want the Mors to damage it, that's all.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Shouldn't a Fairy Knight fight the Child of Prophecy?|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I should, but not at the moment. You are all well aware that war is looming on the horizon.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
We Fairy Knights, the Child of Prophecy, and the Foreign Magus shall have a confrontation on the front lines.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
And so, there is simply no need to rush.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
When the time comes, I'll swiftly gouge you to death. To the point that your souls will leap out from sheer pain.
 
**Artoria:**
How cruel and ruthless of you... Even more so, coming from the one said to be the most beautiful fairy in the kingdom.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The most beautiful?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I'm glad to hear that, but you are incorrect. I am not the most beautiful in Britain.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I'd be more amenable to the phrase 'beauty in performance'. But there's a difference between 'combat ability' and true beauty.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No...we're not in a relation where such things should be discussed...I still don't have a solid grasp on the distance between fairies...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You are here to ring the 'Pilgrim's Bell'?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
If so, you had better leave now. Nothing remains here for you.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
What's left has been burned to the bone&mdash; kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
???
 

---

 
**Mira:**
You gave me a fright there. Did you happen to see a ghost?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I did! I'm looking at one right now! You guys, are you not seeing this!?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's a Fairy Deadlord!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
And...the fact that it is here means...it's part of the Mirror Clan...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I see...so the one who's been calling me was...
 
**Mira:**
No, no. It's not like that. We're not holding any grudges or anything.
 
**Mira:**
That which needs to be done has been done. I have nothing left to say to you.
 
**Mira:**
More importantly, shouldn't you hurry along to the swamp?
 
**Mira:**
Your birthplace is going to get snatched away, you know? The one who came from outside is trying to carry it away.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We're going too! We can't leave Koyanskaya be, whether Lancelot's with us or not!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The skeleton of a massive creature, and...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Out of place NFF-labelled no-entry tape!
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
What are these brazen strings!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
How dare you defile our lake!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Oh my, defile is a strong word.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I've just so happened to take a fancy to the dress Muryan gave me...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
So with all due respect, I've been undertaking a salvage operation from the air in this manner.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
However, the Mors I've just turned into my familiars can neither carry it out nor break it.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
So I've been wondering if I made a bad investment...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
But it looks like giving it a good shaking was the right answer, even if it happens to be a worthless piece of junk now.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Because, Fairy Knight Lancelot, my long-awaited heart's desire has fallen right into my hands.
 
**P：Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;This presence. You're a juvenile Beast!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's enough, Koyanskaya!|
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Chaldea!? I didn't hear about this, why are you all here!?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Lancelot, you know about Beasts!?
 
**P：Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I should be the one asking you. I see...so Pan-human History has been driven to that point as well, huh.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
(That skeleton is the corpse of Albion...! Either way, it's not something we can hand over to Koyanskaya...!)
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, let's assist Lancelot!
 
**Da Vinci:**
We don't know what Koyanskaya's aim is, but it's surely nothing good!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Let's cut that tail off this time and drive her out of this Lostbelt!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Eh, what's that? That's no good, narrow-mindedly seeing a beautiful woman purely as a femme fatale.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
This time I'm quiiite actively doing charitable work; the kind that will benefit all of humanity&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Well, there's no point in reasoning with people who can't see through that sort of troublesome stuff.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
And it'd be a waste of my hard work if you interrupted this opportunity to acquire excellent weapons...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
So let's have everyone's lives go poof, along with all your collective karma☆
 
**Artoria:**
Everyone, step back! Something really bad's rising up from the swamp...!
 
**Artoria:**
A dragon? Is that what they call a dragon!? Could this be Albio&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No! It's just your average Mors, look closely!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Compared to your skills, your judgement is lacking! You'll never measure up to Morgan like this!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No, Artoria's misunderstanding is no surprise. This much magical energy isn't normal, you know!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
There's at least as much as the Calamity at Norwich, if not more!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm, I thought as much. All the water in this swamp has properties similar to Mors!
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's brimming with hostility towards fairies! And we're surrounded by Mors, there's no retreating!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Yes. This is where Albion's carcass rotted, the most defiled lake in all of Britain.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
And that's not all. The 'Spring War' occurred here during the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
It's a melting pot of 8,000 years worth of grudges from the Northern Fairies who were massacred here.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
As for Albion itself, its skin and flesh have both melted away, leaving only its skeleton, a defective product, but&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
It's no difficult task to gather up the magical elements that dissolved into the lake to recreate 'what once was'.
 
**P：Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You fiend&mdash;you mean to take Albion, the rotten dragon that expired in the Sea of Nothingness, with you as a corpse!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Of course not, zombies have no value as a commercial product.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
This is a temporary service sale. It will return to being a carcass after wiping out all of Chaldea.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Didn't I say so? My heart's desire is you.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
The confidential information I've received from Beryl&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I'll be helping myself to your entire being, 'still-living Albion'.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lancelot is Albion...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But she looks like a fairy!?
 

---

 
**Koyanskaya:**
Now, I do apologize but that's all for business.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Everyone from Chaldea, I truly thank you for your long standing patronage.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I shall guide you to the underworld one step ahead of the destruction Britain brings.
 
**Da Vinci:**
(This isn't anything like Norwich...!)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(It's suicidal to fight a Mors of this scale in a situation like this without Mash's protection&mdash;!)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ugh...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(We need to escape to the ruins somehow...!)
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
As if&mdash;! Don't be fooled. This is a paper-thin bluff!
 
**Habetrot:**
Sure, the curse of the swamp is awesome, but this is just a Calamity without a host!
 
**Habetrot:**
It's just something that strange woman temporarily awakened. It's not your enemy!
 
**Habetrot:**
Now let's defeat it and move on, Fujimaru!
 
**Habetrot:**
We don't have time to be dawdling in a place like this! Mash is waiting for you at Orkney!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Really, Habenyan!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
In that case!
 

---

 
**Koyanskaya:**
...! (They've regained their will to fight...! That fairy, she went and did it...!)
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Very well. I shall lend a hand, Chaldea of pan-human history.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
For this moment alone, I shall discard the name gifted by Her Majesty.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
If that is Albion's carcass, then only I can incinerate it.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Hear me, I am not the knight Lancelot!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
My True Name is Mélusine. Mélusine of the Dark Lake!
 
**K：Mélusine:**
Named by the fairest of them all, I am the descendant of Albion!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**F：Mélusine:**
Beast!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It hit...!|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, that's Fairy Knight Lancelot's Arondight. It definitely punched through the Spiritual Core.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
&mdash;
 
**Habetrot:**
She disappeared! Lan&ndash;no, Mélusine! What happened? Did she escape?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...Lancelot. In this form, I am the Fairy Knight Lancelot.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I will not respond unless you call me that...not that I have any answers to give you.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Got it, Lancelot. I'll make sure the name we just heard is off limits.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It seems your powers don't change, with or without a gifted name.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If anything, you're weaker with than without. That's a boon for us.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's right. You speak very practically. Thank you.
 
**Da Vinci:**
R-really? I'm flattered by the compliment, but...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Now, about Koyanskaya. Is it safe to assume she escaped?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Well...perhaps.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
In order to crush her, you would need to target her head, not her heart.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
She may have been a weak and immature Beast as of yet, but her vitality was unparalleled.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I guess...she has a lot of lives. She'll be stuck for a few days now, though.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm glad we were able to drive her off.|
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
True. She is likely to be flailing about by now, trying to cover the gaping hole in her chest. That'll teach her a lesson.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's thanks to you, Lancelot.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Oh, good. You seemed aware at first, but did it strike you as self-evident?
 

---

 
**Mira:**
Thank goodness! Master Bones will stay put now!
 
**Mira:**
Without him, the plug would be pulled on the lake, and we would be returned to the ocean.
 
**Mira:**
Then the boundary between the earth and the Spirit Cave would disappear, and Princess Ainsel would weep!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Master Bones? Is that what the Mirror Clan called Albion?
 
**Mira:**
Yup. Isn't it easier to understand?
 
**Mira:**
We'd better head back. If we stay too long, you'll grow ever more sickly.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So it seems... A toxin that can affect a Saint Graph could mutate a living being on a genetic level.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm not interested in Albion's corpse. Besides, we have other things to attend to.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's head back to those ruins.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about you, Lancelot...?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Why do you bother to ask? I will remain here a while longer. I have a responsibility to uphold.
 
**Artoria:**
By that, you mean keeping Albion's bones out of more mischief?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
To put it simply, yes. My thanks for the loose translation.

**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
What are you staring at me for? I'm sorry, but you won't find any gaps or weaknesses.
 
**Artoria:**
No, I was just wondering what was meant by “the still-living Albion”.
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, and the name Mélusine, it's pretty.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(Even Habetrot balked, but she went straight for it!)
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
None of your business...it isn't a topic of discussion between us.
 
**Mira:**
Lancelot is Albion's “left hand”.
 
**Mira:**
When the stars formed the Sea of Nothingness, Albion, who had not returned to paradise, ran out of strength and crashed to his death.
 
**Mira:**
But even as the core shut down, the still-living flesh dismembered the left hand at the moment of putrefaction.
 
**Mira:**
That was the early state of Mélusine.
 
**Mira:**
I've been in the lake for so long, I had no idea whether she was alive or dead!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...
 
**Habetrot:**
Huuuh. I never saw anything like that down here before.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You wouldn't have... Before I took this form, I was a filthy pile of meat.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No muscles, bones, cilia, or body hair. Neither joy nor pleasure. Neither sadness nor agony.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I didn't know what I was as a dragon, or what I wanted to be.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I simply existed as a living thing, if you could even call that life. I was just “something” squirming in that dark swamp.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Until&mdash;
 
**Fairies:**
Please stop, Lady Aurora...! Your body will be soiled!
 
**Fairies:**
It's only a bottom-feeder nesting in the swamp. Filth no better than a Mors!
 
**Aurora:**
Why do you say that? It's struggling so much, trying so hard to reach the light.
 
**Aurora:**
Don't worry. The lake is shallow. I'm sure I can help.
 
**Fairies:**
Eeeep...! How horrible, it's like rotten fruit!
 
**Fairies:**
Please keep away, Lady Aurora...! Your dress will be soiled!
 
**Aurora:**
My...it must have been so cold and chilly. Maybe you're not a water fairy at all?
 
**Aurora:**
Tee-hee. Hello, sweetheart. Or should I say, good morning?
 
**Aurora:**
I am Aurora. Do you have a name?
 
**Aurora:**
Since we've become friends, why don't we have some tea? As long as it's not too much trouble...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;Until someone whimsically plucked me out.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That was when my self took shape. For the first time, I'd seen something beautiful.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
My self as a mere cell found admiration for, and discovered my will in trying to emulate her.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
This body is the result of that. The name Mélusine was also given to me by her.
 
**Da Vinci:**
No muscle, bone, or even cilia for cells to move with. You were like an amoeba.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But then you found a role model, and transformed into a fairy. That's how it was?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's right. Isn't it amazing. I mean&mdash;an honest-to-goodness miracle.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Who else but her would have considered picking me up out of that dark and muddy swamp?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
My life is hers. I became who I am in order to fulfill her wishes.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But she has a position to protect. We couldn't be together forever.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
A hundred years ago, the clans of Earth and Wind, King and Fang, were so afraid of the Calamities that they started fighting again.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I became the Fairy Knight Lancelot at Her Majesty Morgan's suggestion in order to quell the fighting.
 
**Artoria:**
And you were the only one not to have your own troops or a dominion.
 
**Artoria:**
Tristan—Baobhan Sith, hates fairies. Gawain—Barghest, loves them, and humans as well.
 
**Artoria:**
What about you? What do you think, Lancelot?
 
**Artoria:**
What sort of impulse led you to care so much about Percival?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It's no impulse...I'm madly in love with Percival.
 
**Artoria:**
Love...!?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I watched over him since he was very little...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
For ten years. My heart filled with delight and confusion; with gratitude and loneliness as he grew.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I couldn't have been a good mentor, sister, or friend to him...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I even dreamed many times of a future where Percival could live like a human of pan-human history.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Yet not only did he reject Her Majesty Morgan's invitation, he organized something as trivial as the Round Table Army...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Percival...has gone stray. And I, a mother dragon... don't know where I went wrong raising him...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If you're worried about Percival...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Even now, the Round Table Army...
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I cannot...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I obey Her Majesty Morgan, as a Fairy Knight is bound to do.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It means nothing to me whether the Child of Prophecy is in the right. I have sworn myself to Her Majesty according to my beliefs.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
We can get back from this point.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I can't stay away from Camelot forever. I'll see you again on the battlefield, as an enemy.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even if it means fighting Percival?|
 

---

 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's the choice I've made...You should respect that freedom.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But don't tell Percival that we spoke. It will only serve to hurt him.
 
**Mira:**
Well, byyye~! Good luck in the battle at Camelot~!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...
 
**Mira:**
There she goes. Just like before, she's away as quickly as she came.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mira, I've been wondering...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was the Mirror Clan destroyed by...
 

---

 
**Mira:**
Oh, it's fine. What's done is done. Don't worry about it.
 
**Mira:**
Everyone in the Mirror Clan could see the future. It's no different from being dead at the moment of birth.
 
**Mira:**
You know when you're going to die, but where you are in the instant is just a haze.
 
**Mira:**
That's why I'm not all that sad or vengeful. It just hurt like crazy when it happened.
 
**Mira:**
Still...I feel bad about what happened to Princess Ainsel.
 
**Mira:**
Ainsel was our leader, and she was always concerned about our future.
 
**Mira:**
“There must be a way to save them,” or “somehow, I have to protect them all.”
 
**Mira:**
She had nothing else on her mind, and went on apologizing until the very end.
 
**Mira:**
It ought to have been Princess Ainsel who became the Fairy Deadlord...
 
**Mira:**
It ought to be difficult to apologize after dying, so it fell on me to take on the role of messenger☆
 
**Artoria:**
Messenger... A message for the Child of Prophecy?
 
**Mira:**
Yeah, exactly~!
 
**Mira:**
Sorry, but there's no Pilgrim's Bell here. That was only for the clan heads.
 
**Mira:**
It faded with Princess Ainsel, so you'll need to find a substituuute.
 
**Mira:**
And, uh, I don't want to say too much....
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hey, Mira
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Leave it, Fujimaru. Shut up and listen.
 

---

 
**Mira:**
Princess Ainsel said this at the end of her life:
 
**Mira:**
“The Child of Prophecy's second coming is nigh.”
 
**Mira:**
“The first time to live, and the second to die.”
 
**Artoria:**
I see...Take heart that I've received this important prophecy.
 
**Artoria:**
Thank you, Mira. You're an ace.
 
**Mira:**
Heheh. I'm just glad the Child of Prophecy can see that much!
 
**Mira:**
No more hesitation or reservation, save Britain and your fellow fairies!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Ouch, owowowow!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
This is seriously bad. Did the sixth tail alter ego I dispatched on-site get its heart blasted out!?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Oh, darn it...what a loss. To think I'd lose a tail I went through all that trouble to foster...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
The authority of one tail for each Lostbelt. Nine Lost Tails...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Each possessing a unique trait based on the Lostbelt.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I never imagined that my plan to become a beast surpassing that Celestial Fox would be rendered naught on the sixth one in...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Well, I suppose giving up doesn't sound too bad!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Now that I think about it, there are only seven Lostbelts☆ That's two short from the get-go!
 
**Imaginary Fou-kun:**
Fou, fou!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Let's stay positive here. Right now, it's a matter of whether I cut my losses here or not.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
The real Albion is a carcass. Since it has no fur, I can't make it part of me.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
As for Lady Mélusine...she's a fae, not a beast. Quite similar to a Heroic Spirit. Too late for her, as well.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Folding here would be a big loss, but there's really no reason to keep fixating on this Fairyland anymore either.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
My very own casino resort. It's been a good reference for building my own Primatosphere.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I'm sorry, Muryan, but...
 
**Oberon:**
Are you leaving the Fairy Kingdom? You're as cold-hearted as you look, huh?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Oh, my. Well, well. Thanks for the other day.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
“Keep this a secret from Fujimaru, but I want you to eliminate the reinforcements sent to Woodwose.”
 
**Koyanskaya:**
“As compensation, I will tell you where Albion is&mdash;”
 
**Koyanskaya:**
If it isn't the self-proclaimed Fairy King who compensated me with garbage information.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
You knew Albion no longer had any value, didn't you?
 
**Oberon:**
Naturally. Why would I ever help an enemy of Chaldea? I just made use of Albion's grave as a bargaining chip.
 
**Oberon:**
Can you really say your losses following that are my responsibility? Of course not.
 
**Oberon:**
Now, let's stop pointing fingers. I'd rather not end up heaving up my breakfast from this discomfort.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
No matter...Even if it's just the leftovers, it's still the last pure-blooded dragon.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I couldn't make it a part of myself, but the information I've obtained from the skeleton has proven useful.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
It should serve as a fine foundation for the Avenging A-Grade Armaments...the Grand TamaMo Shrine that's being manufactured at NFF Services HQ.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
A good day to you then, gallant and cunning prince. Do your best to serve as Chaldea's guide.
 
**Oberon:**
You want a weapon that can destroy the world, no?
 
**Oberon:**
I don't really want to suggest this...but right now, I'd ask for assistance no matter the kind of beast it may be from.
 
**Oberon:**
I know of a stronger product that'd be more to your liking.
 
**Oberon:**
Isn't it a little early for you to be leaving Britain?
 
## Fragment / 9 
 

 The end of the 400th Year of the Fairy Calendar.
 After the fall of Londinium.
 At Orkney.
 
**Mash:**
Totrot...have you seen Tonelico?
 
**Totrot:**
She went to check up on the World Tree...What you called the Fantasy Tree.
 
**Totrot:**
She said she'd have it wither, and bring about the end of the Fairy Calendar. That she'd build a new kingdom.
 
**Mash:**
Is that so...? I have neither the right nor the words to stop her...
 
**Mash:**
Tonelico...after losing everything and everyone...
 
**Mash:**
That which everyone built up was prematurely torn down, with no rhyme or reason.
 
**Mash:**
There's...no way left to save this Britain, is there?
 
**Mash:**
But...for me alone to survive...remaining into the future......
 
**Totrot:**
Mash...
 
**Totrot:**
That's not true, Mash. You're not remaining. You're going back.
 
**Totrot:**
You don't belong in the Fairy Calendar to begin with!
 
**Totrot:**
Tonelico even said that everything will fit together perfectly like this! That's why this is a good thing!
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Totrot:**
Oh dear, no can do about that, huh. Are you really that anxious? If so, let's make a promise.
 
**Totrot:**
A special promise. A promise to prove that your being here wasn't a mistake.
 
**Mash:**
A special...promise?
 
**Totrot:**
Yep. Before I lost to Tonelico, I used to be violent and selfish. I was shunned by the Wing Clan.
 
**Totrot:**
But as I spent time with Tonelico, becoming her companion, and beating up bad guys to save Britain...
 
**Totrot:**
I really enjoyed all of that, but for some reason, I always felt lonely. There was a hole in my heart.
 
**Totrot:**
I thought to myself, “what do I want to do? What should I do? What brings me joy?”
 
**Totrot:**
You filled that hole for me. You told me that story, didn't you? Of a fairy named Habetrot in a place called Scotland.
 
**Totrot:**
I don't care who's in the right, the me from this Lostbelt or the me from that side.
 
**Totrot:**
It's just that I envied the me from that side. I mean, she would be so happy!
 
**Totrot:**
You gave me a dream, Mash. And in saying that, I don't mean I dream of becoming the Habetrot of Pan-human History.
 
**Totrot:**
Mash, my dream is to see you as a bride.
 
**Totrot:**
And I will forever continue to protect you, the one who gave me that dream. I will remain ever grateful to you for coming here.
 
**Totrot:**
So don't worry, and just wait here.
 
**Totrot:**
While you're asleep, I will become an excellent artisan and see off at least a hundred brides.
 
**Totrot:**
If I do so, then maybe this little wish of mine may come true.
 
**Totrot:**
I mean, I'm going to be making a hundred people happy. Surely if I do that much, I can become an adult!
 
**Mash:**
Yes...yes...! I'm sure you can do it, Totrot&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure you can become the greatest seamstress fairy!
 
**Totrot:**
Yep. It's a promise then. You can forget it if you want, just sit tight and wait for me.
 
**Totrot:**
I will work hard and will surely make a dress wonderful enough to suit you.
 
**Narration:**
Thus, Mash was laid to rest as the first Fairy Knight. The girl known as 'Mash' could not be part of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Narration:**
That's why, by asserting that it was the first fairy knight that entered the coffin here...
 
**Narration:**
We would be able to avoid a paradox within the Queen's Calendar. Smart move, Tonelico!
 
**Totrot:**
But Tonelico, why are you helping Mash?
 
**Totrot:**
Even I can tell there's no profit in it for you.
 
**Tonelico:**
She possesses a unique Saint Graph. It would be for the best if, in the future, I could have her as a subordinate.
 
**Totrot:**
I see...
 
**Totrot:**
Well, I don't get any of that, so I won't ask!
 
**Totrot:**
You're going to wither the Fantasy Tree now, aren't you, Tonelico!? A lot of fairies are going to die!
 
**Totrot:**
Then our journey ends here! I had fun. See you later, Tonelico!
 
**Totrot:**
I'm heading back down south to undergo some fairy training myself!
 
**Tonelico:**
I see... Bye-bye, Totrot.
 
**Tonelico:**
For your own sake&mdash;that'll be good. Just don't forget what I taught you, okay?
 
**Narration:**
My diary. Page 14800.
 
**Narration:**
400 years have passed since then. I am now a famous seamstress fairy.
 
**Narration:**
I've seen off more than a hundred brides. But my wish did not come true. Of course it didn't.
 
**Narration:**
In the end, I still haven't made a dress for the first and most important bride of all.
 
**Narration:**
These days, my legs don't move. My vision has blurred and I can no longer even hold a pen.
 
**Narration:**
On the other hand, it's business as usual in Britain.
 
**Narration:**
Due to Tonelico abandoning her role as Savior, the conflicts between the clans became unsightly.
 
**Narration:**
This year is the 12,000th year. The year where the once-in-a-millennia Great Calamity will occur.
 
**Narration:**
Originally, Britain would've perished here. That day, Tonelico shared as much.
 
**Narration:**
But I knew such a thing would not come to pass. Because Mash told me that Britain still exists in the future.
 
**Totrot:**
&mdash;Alright, no one will notice me here.
 
**Narration:**
I sat in the corner of a cave in the north.
 
**Narration:**
As soon as I did so, I lost my vision, my mouth stopped moving and my mind went blank.
 
**Narration:**
I see. I was so very tired.
 
**Totrot:**
Umm...2017...2017...the fortified city of Sheffield......
 
**Narration:**
I sprinkle the petrification powder Grimm made over my head.
 
**Narration:**
I hear the sound of the world itself breaking in the distance. I hear the screams of the clans.
 
**Narration:**
The winter tempest that tolls the bell of vengeance. Tonelico has returned from the furthest reaches of the world, Orkney.
 
**Totrot:**
A final war...
 
**Totrot:**
No Uther, no Round Table, no Ector, no Grimm.
 
**Totrot:**
A lonely Winter War, huh...?
 
**Totrot:**
I'm sorry I couldn't stand by your side, Tonelico. But I really am tired of fighting.
 
**Narration:**
That marked the end of the Fairy Calendar. The moment our pilgrimage was rendered meaningless.
 
**Narration:**
The moment a lone savior disappeared from the annals of history, forgotten by all.
 
## Section 19: Orkney 
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We've finally arrived. This'd be the northernmost part of Britain...
 
**Da Vinci:**
This would be somewhere around Edinburgh in terms of Pan-human History Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If we continue further north, we should reach Scotland. However, in the Fairy Kingdom, this seems to be the northernmost point.
 
**Artoria:**
I'd heard that it's cold up here but...you couldn't even begin to imagine this sort of cold down south...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is this white stuff snow?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not as cold as Russia, but it's still freezing.
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
These are the tears of the Rain Clan.
 
**Habetrot:**
The vestiges of the Rain Clan that was wiped out in the year 4000 of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Habetrot:**
A song of lament, a warning to the other clans, and tears of apology meant for the Fairy of Paradise.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Fairy of Paradise?|
 
**Habetrot:**
Just like the name implies, it's a fairy sent from paradise. You'll know the meaning soon enough.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is Mash really in Orkney...?
 
**Habetrot:**
She sure is. I'm sorry I didn't say anything until now. Just a little bit further now, do your best.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Tears of apology for the Fairy of Paradise...
 
**Artoria:**
Why did the Rain Clan even perish in the first place? Mors? Northern fairies?
 
**Habetrot:**
Wind, Earth, Fang, Wing; four clans joined forces and wiped them out overnight.
 
**Artoria:**
An alliance of four clans...then it's no wonder a single clan was done in like that...
 
**Artoria:**
But the clans should have all been on bad terms with each other until Queen Morgan unified Britain.
 
**Artoria:**
To think there'd be an alliance. And between multiple clans, at that.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes. Quite difficult to imagine. It'd be hard to pull off unless they had a 'common enemy'.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Was the Rain Clan powerful enough to warrant such fear?
 
**Habetrot:**
No. The Rain Clan, much like the Mirror Clan, was a gentle and peaceful clan.
 
**Habetrot:**
Even the reason they settled in the north was because they didn't want to compete with the other clans down south.
 
**Artoria:**
Then why?
 
**Habetrot:**
Because they protected the Fairy of Paradise.
 
**Habetrot:**
The Rain Clan took pity on the fairy who drifted from paradise, and raised her as their own princess.
 
**Habetrot:**
That was what set off the other clan leaders.
 
**Habetrot:**
“We will never let the pilgrimage happen. Accursed traitors, we will destroy your entire clan,” they said.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Traitors...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What did they mean by 'pilgrimage'?
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
Enough chit-chat. The welcoming party from Orkney is here, everyone.
 
**White Wolf:**
&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Woah, that's a fine wolf! Looks warm!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, it even feels divine...wait, this guy's actually divine, isn't he?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(There are no gods in Britain...which means there's a Divine Spirit Servant nearby?)
 
**White Wolf:**
&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's heading over there. Maybe it wants us to follow it?
 
**Habetrot:**
Yeah. There should be a small boat I used a long, long time ago. We can use it to cross over to Orkney.
 
**Habetrot:**
After all, it takes less than 30 minutes to get to the other side. And that will mark the end of my adventure.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's a...bonfire where the white wolf is headed towards?|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yep. And there's another wolf in front of that bonfire... and also...
 
**F：???:**
Woah there, so you've returned, Freki. Here's a fish Muninn caught. Want some?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That's a Servant, Fujimaru.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Did a Servant from Pan-human History other than Oberon also make it here?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, those robes are...|
 

---

 
**F：???:**
...Hm?
 
**F：???:**
Hey, Fujimaru! What took you so long? I was beginning to think you weren't coming!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's Cu Chulainn!|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Cu Chulainn!?
 
**F：???:**
Sorry, but could you not call me by that name? It'll make my Saint Graph's output plummet.
 
**F：???:**
Here, I've been going by Grimm for a while now. I'd appreciate it if you'd call me that.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Grimm...now that you mention it, there used to be an ancient fairy who went by that name in Europe...
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Wasn't that another name for the chief god of the Norse pantheon?)
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
What? You didn't tell them about me, Habetrot?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's cold. Even though I helped you out at Sheffield.
 
**Habetrot:**
Woah, I didn't notice back then with all the ruckus but you've become an old man, Grimm...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Not an old man, more like an older brother!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I don't know what the previous me was like, but the second generation turned out like this. Sorry about that!
 
**Habetrot:**
Seriously...? Time is a cruel mistress... Tonelico would die of shock if she could see you now...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Cu Chulainn is Grimm the Wise?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please explain further!
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah, I'll explain all you want, alright. We're hardly strangers, after all. However...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Only after I make sure the Child of Prophecy over there is the real deal!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That bastard, he's raring to go. Is it okay to fight back, Fujimaru!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
M-maybe...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Isn't this just your usual test of mettle?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Roger that! He's quite a violent person for being Fujimaru's acquaintance!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, that face and voice gets on my nerves for some reason! Let's rough him up a bit!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Beating the pulp out of a Heroic Spirit you just met. Is that how the Child of Prophecy acts? I get it now.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I have no intention of talking with someone that violent. May I ask you to leave?
 
**Artoria:**
B-b-but, you're the one who told us to bring it on!?
 
**Artoria:**
Right, Fujimaru!? No, Fujimaru is the one who said go for it in the first place!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I guess Grimm didn't say that...|
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeeeep, I didn't say anything. I just got a fire going cause it's cold, is all.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Are you a kid!? Don't sulk just because you lost!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I didn't say that either...
 
**Artoria:**
Ehh... You're deflecting just like Oberon...
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
Yeah. This terrible personality. It's the real one. This is Grimm all grown up, alright.
 
**Habetrot:**
Hey Grimm, explain! Since when did you return to Britain!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
“Since when”? “Return”? Hm, so then...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Cu...no, Grimm. Could this be your second summoning?
 
**Da Vinci:**
You were first summoned during the Fairy Calendar and your second summoning was now during the Queen's Calendar. Something like that?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Well, your advisor's eager to get down to business I see. I guess the ones who restored the Human Order once aren't all talk.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I suppose I'll stop joking around now.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Just by crossing wands with you...I can tell you're the Child of Prophecy, the Fairy of Paradise.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Allow me to introduce myself again.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I am Grimm the Wise. My True Name is Cu Chulainn. A Heroic Spirit on Pan-human History's side.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
6,000 years ago, I acted as the Divine Spirit Odin.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Now, I act as Odin's proxy. I've been standing vigil here since last year.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
Divine Spirit...is this the 'God' you've all been talking about!?
 
**Artoria:**
But he's surprisingly friendly and doesn't seem dignified at all!?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Oh, that's a nice reaction. The girl's far more candid than I imagined.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Well, undignified sounds about right. Even though I'm acting as a Divine Spirit's proxy, I'm still an ordinary Heroic Spirit like that old man over there.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Feel free to just call me Grimm. Think of me like a casual older brother, okay?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Huh? Older brother, my ass. Being the proxy of a Divine Spirit means you're also an old man on the inside, aren't you?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I'm young in both mind and body regardless! I died before I grew old!
 
**Artoria:**
(For some reason, these two don't get along.)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Maybe it's fate.)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Maybe they hate how similar they are.)
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Anyway...the explanation comes first.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's troublesome, but my role has become strangely complicated.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Let me start by explaining that.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Listen up now, Fujimaru and Child of Prophecy.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Firstly, my relationship with Chaldea. I'm the same guy who entered a contract with you back in Fuyuki.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Although I did get reset after returning to the Throne of Heroes, I still retain memories of Fujimaru and Olgamarie.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Even of King Arthur, who even now stands her ground there.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Singularity F...you're talking about the Fuyuki in 2004 that Chaldeas also defined as Singularity X.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I too, have it on record.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But Servants who have been unsummoned should not be able to retain those memories.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's where the Divine Spirit interfered. In my case, you could call it a deterrence.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
To assist Chaldea. That's what the god who transferred his authority to me wanted.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
This god is a god of magecraft and wisdom, you see. He predicted that 'it'll be checkmate unless I act here'.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Fuyuki and Britain are the 'here'. As for the 'act'&mdash;
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Well...to put it simply, it's about 'recovery'.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
In the first place, this god has been watching this Lostbelt for a long time now with his multidimensional eye.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The first summoning took place 6,000 years ago in order to help the Fairy of Paradise.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The first Grimm the Wise used the body of a native fairy as a host and became what you'd call a Pseudo Servant.
 
**Habetrot:**
Yep. In human terms, he looked about 14 years old! And all he had was a sword!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I see. Well, I'll be damned. What kind of kid was it?
 
**Habetrot:**
Unruly and mischievous. Tonelico relied on him regardless, though!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Was he your comrade-in-arms? That'd be great if so.
 
**Habetrot:**
Yeah. After we parted ways with Tonelico, the two of us talked a fair bit.
 
**Habetrot:**
Grimm gave me a magical powder and left me with a plan. After that, he disappeared during the Great Calamity, no?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah. Perhaps because Tonelico severed the contract, Grimm disappeared after the Fantasy Tree withered.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
But our friendly god left behind a means before he disappeared. A countermeasure for after this Lostbelt has replaced reality.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The bad end revision of the Human Order that awaited after resolving the dead end incineration.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It was something that could no longer be averted. In other words, the prerequisite conditions had already been met.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's why he thought he would at least shoulder the problems of this Lostbelt and lighten Chaldea's load, if only a little.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
And I'm the Pseudo Servant chosen to be the one who will take on the task of 'solving this problem'.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
First off, that god transferred his authority to me at point X, Fuyuki, and I became a Caster. Then I forged a connection with Chaldea.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
After that, I was dispatched to this Britain which would checkmate the Human Order if left alone.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I didn't know about Grimm the Wise until I arrived, though.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
All I knew was 'what I have to do as a Divine Spirit of pan-human History'. That's all.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
In that sense, I was no different from Fujimaru in terms of what I knew about this Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's why, for a whole year after I was summoned, I've been investigating what happened during the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Calamities and clans. Morgan and the Fairy Knights. The turning point between the Fairy Calendar and the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
And after seeing what was in the bell tower here, I was able to get a grasp on the overall situation.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That my role was to wait for you guys here.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
To ensure the success of the 'pilgrimage' and send the Fairy of Paradise back to paradise.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um...in other words?|
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Don't think too hard about it, it's the same as it was in Fuyuki.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I shall accompany you on your journey henceforth. Please make us of me as a Servant in battle.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
And in exchange&mdash;
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I will, at any cost, fulfill Ainsel's prophecy. The promise Tonelico could not fulfill.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Although it seems like the first generation me was too naive, this is the role of Grimm the Wise.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Welcome, Grimm the Wise. This is irregular, but I take it to mean you're an allied Servant summoned on-site.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'd like you to tell me what you know about the Fairy Calendar and Queen's Calendar, but before that...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I get it, I get it. The girl with the shield takes precedence, no?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The safety of your comrade is more important than even the restoration of the Human Order. This will disqualify me as a sage, but I totally agree with you.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
In the first place, that girl will know more about the Fairy Calendar than I do anyway. There's no need for me to even explain.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you, Cu Chulainn!|
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Oh, holding my hands firmly with both hands. Is this a handshake of gratitude? That's nice, this is how you young ones should be!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is that alright?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Our destination is the same regardless. All that needs doing is to fulfill our objective here.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
You know where Mash is. Then...as I thought.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah. The Pilgrim's Bell.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
See that crumbling castle over there? There's a bell tower on its rooftop.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
If we can see it, that makes things simpler. Let's head over there, Fujimaru.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's not that simple. Something bad's loitering around up ahead.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's like ghosts wandering about in the mist, but they're nothing to sneeze at.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
We'll overcome this, but don't underestimate them as mere ghosts, okay?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
They'll end up being tougher than any opponent you've faced up until now if you don't watch your step, got it?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's some thick fog...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(That ghost just now...)
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Don't stray now. The bell tower isn't going anywhere. With this fog, we'll get split up if we rush ahead. Proceed calmly.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Hey Grimm...we should've arrived at the bell tower already, with how far we've walked.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We just climbed that grand staircase. But this is...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Well, these things happen. It's not exactly a druid's job to hear the voices of the dead...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's asking 'are you worthy?' It seems it doesn't want us proceeding any further.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
What'll it be, Fujimaru? Want to wait it out until the fog lifts?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This fog probably won't ever lift...|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not worthy. But I'm moving forward anyway!
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's how it is, gentlemen. Thanks for the warning, but it's of little use.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
In the first place, the soul is something to be reincarnated. What's the point in lingering? Time to move on!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
We made it to the roof...! This is definitely the bell tower! And&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is she...sealed in ice...?
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
&mdash;
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah. That's a coffin that's been here for 2,400 years, since the year 400 of the Fairy Calendar.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That long!? How did that even happen!?|
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You'll have to ask the little lady herself. I don't know the reason either.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Based on what was passed down from the first Grimm, the magecraft of that coffin will break if the Master touches it.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
When you get up there, you'll get your lady friend back.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
But&mdash;
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
There's one hurdle left. If we don't take care of that, we can't get anywhere near the coffin or the bell.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Time to get serious, Artoria. Without you, there's nothing I can do.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Is everything alright, Habetrot...? It's calling your name.
 
**Habetrot:**
You're just mishearing it. Finish it off, Artoria.
 
**Habetrot:**
This is the sanctuary of Orkney. A terrace loved by fairies of peace and serenity.
 
**Habetrot:**
It's not a place where the dead should linger. Their once-upon-a-time is over.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That was...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where...
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Well done, Artoria. Seems like both of you made up your minds.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Now all that's left is to ring the bell, and your task in Orkney will be done. But first, let's take care of this.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Touch the coffin, Fujimaru. Get your girl back.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Approach slowly)|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Rush over)
 

---

 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Tonelico:**
Ahh&mdash;ahh&mdash;AUUUUUGHHHH!
 
**Tonelico:**
Why, why, why...!?
 
**Tonelico:**
It should've been the happiest day in Britain. The day when everything was going to change for the better!
 
**Tonelico:**
They killed Uther...! They killed the entire Round Table like they were mere trash...!
 
**Tonelico:**
After all we did for them, and all the praise heaped onto Uther!
 
**Tonelico:**
Poisoning his wine&mdash;the easiest and ugliest method, not even allowing him resistance&mdash;!
 
**Tonelico:**
Uther...Uther, Uther, Uther! Please, talk to me. Say anything, just once more...!
 
**Tonelico:**
Every time I've failed, I've gotten back up. I've worked so hard for thousands of years!
 
**Tonelico:**
Come, can't you do this!? Can't you do even this much!?
 
**Tonelico:**
Don't you know that I can't save Britain!? That I can't provide the Britain yearned for!?
 
**Tonelico:**
Ugh...uggh...unnnggggh!
 
**Tonelico:**
Peace and equality were the wrong path to take...!
 
**Tonelico:**
I won't forgive them, ever...! Not a single one, not ever...!
 
**Tonelico:**
Haa...haa...haa&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
I was born here in Britain over 3,000 years ago. Since then, I have defeated all manner of Calamities.
 
**Narration:**
But afterwards, I was always rejected as a nuisance.
 
**Narration:**
I would escape the gazes of the fairies, prepare my hiding place, then awaken from sleep who knows how many times.
 
**Narration:**
I have come to understand that my enemies are not merely the calamities, but also the fairies of Britain.
 
**Narration:**
They were pure and innocent creatures who relished both in genuine goodness and unblemished evils.
 
**Narration:**
They were, when all was said and done, the same as the ugly human beings who had driven “me” from Britain.
 
**Narration:**
That's why I suppressed my ill intentions&ndash;my entitledness, prejudice, persecution, enviness, and joviality.
 
**Narration:**
It was mutually agreed upon to bring these evil seeds back to harvest.
 
**Narration:**
Most, if not all, fairies understood and supported the cause for a better future.
 
**Narration:**
Yet malice lingered. The foundations of peace so many fairies had worked so hard to build...
 
**Narration:**
...was overturned on a whim by those who found it unpleasant.
 
**Tonelico:**
Ha&mdash;Haha. Ahaha. Hahaha. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...!!!!
 
**Narration:**
I don't know anymore. If even this can't work, I have no faith in the innate goodness of living things.
 
**Narration:**
What point is there in understanding? The effort turned out a total waste.
 
**Narration:**
Despite the many times I knew I had been betrayed, I still clinged to a thin thread of hope.
 
**Narration:**
I failed again this time because I fixated on such a thing.
 
**Narration:**
If I want Britain to survive, then 'saving' it is the wrong course of action.
 
**Narration:**
I will humor this no longer. No longer will I play the role of savior. I will establish a different, better system.
 
**Tonelico:**
Yes...
 
**Tonelico:**
I will not save the fairies. I will not pardon the fairies.
 
**Tonelico:**
The mission of Avalon le Fae matters not to me. I merely seek to rule. That alone will suffice.
 
**Soldiers of the Clans:**
There she is! Tonelico, the agitator! Capture her alive and bring her to justice as the clan heads command!
 
**Tonelico?:**
No, stop...! I'm not her, I'm not...!
 
**Tonelico?:**
But, who...who am I!?
 
**Narration:**
In the distance, far from here, I hear the shriek of a fairy unrelated to me.
 
**Narration:**
The woman who had sold us out to the clan heads. I used magecraft to wipe her memory and gave her my face and body.
 
**Narration:**
Thus, the savior Tonelico dies yet again. This time never to rise again.
 
**Narration:**
I don't care if a Calamity comes. I cannot be bothered with every piddling disaster.
 
**Narration:**
Only 400 years remain until the millennial Great Calamity. There's much work to be done before then.
 
**Tonelico:**
&mdash;The Fantasy Tree. A lynchpin forged on an alien planet for the sake of closing in the universe.
 
**Tonelico:**
I already know its workings. The design concept is beautiful, but irrelevant to me.
 
**Tonelico:**
You may have the universe, Celestial One. But Britain is mine.
 
**Tonelico:**
I shall bring an end to this fantasy and make my own dream come true.
 
**Tonelico:**
I will sew my reality of Britain to this planet, and not some “what-if” of yours&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
Londinium lies in ruins. Salisbury will be where the savior is put to death.
 
**Tonelico:**
Ector has been lost, leaving just us heading to Orkney like this.
 
**Tonelico:**
You were right all along, Mash. Our whole pilgrimage was meaningless.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
Don't say that it was meaningless&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
Please don't look so sad. I'm used to this, and most of all&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
We only get to speak like this thanks to the hypothetical “what-if” calculated by the Fantasy Tree.
 
**Tonelico:**
No matter what, the end of the Fairy Calendar converges with the Queen's Calendar as you know it.
 
**Tonelico:**
It was probably inevitable that Tonelico would fail.
 
**Tonelico:**
It's just, well, an ending that I couldn't put up with all the way.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
Tonelico...
 
**Tonelico:**
Londinium is in ruins, Tonelico is put to death, and the first Fairy Knight crosses to Orkney with her coffin.
 
**Tonelico:**
That is the end of the Savior you heard about in the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
So if things don't happen as they should, there will be a contradiction when you awaken.
 
**Tonelico:**
The Fairy Calendar will go on for another 400 years. And when it reaches the 12,000 year mark...
 
**Tonelico:**
The world will be destroyed by the millennial Great Calamity. Afterwards begins the Queen's Calendar, where no Fantasy Tree stands.
 
**Tonelico:**
After Britain switches to the Queen's Calendar...
 
**Tonelico:**
...you cannot take action as Mash until the Calamity of Norwich in 2017.
 
**Tonelico:**
If by chance you do, you will vanish as something brought in from the fluctuating world of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
So, my life in the Fairy Calendar must cease until the point where I was spirited here by the Water Mirror.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
And the only way to return to the Queen's Calendar... has to be by entering a “quantum coffin”.
 
**Tonelico:**
Yes. Even if you could figure out how to rayshift, you couldn't make the return trip without a coffin.
 
**Tonelico:**
These drawbacks must be why Morgan only sent Calamities to the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
All is well if the Queen's Calendar is secure. Some inconsistencies in the Fairy Calendar are acceptable.
 
**Tonelico:**
I guess she doesn't care about the suffering of those in this time period who deal with the Calamities.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
...
 
**Tonelico:**
Also...I have to confess, I already knew how this was going to end.
 
**Tonelico:**
Whether you were rayshifted from the future or not, I knew from the very start that the Savior would fail.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
Huh...? Are you saying you always knew that there would be a Queen's Calendar after this...?
 
**Tonelico:**
No, I didn't know about the Queen's Calendar. It's just that, 2017 AD, when you would have arrived...
 
**Tonelico:**
In Britain, it would've been the year 14,017 in the Fairy Calendar, and by that time, Britain would've already been destroyed.
 
**Tonelico:**
That was the “first time”, the true Lostbelt of Britain.
 
**Tonelico:**
I didn't want that to happen. So I came here from the future, just like you did, and arrived in the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
From my point of view, this world was the “second time” from the very start.
 
**Tonelico:**
Now that you're here, I guess this would be the “third time” or something.
 
**Tonelico:**
Ah, or is it a “new second time”? I've tried to keep the basic flow unchanged, after all.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
Um...then that means&mdash;your real name is...
 
**Tonelico:**
It looks like Totrot has found us a small boat. Let's go then, Mash&ndash;
 
**Tonelico:**
No, Galahad, the first Fairy Knight. That is your name going into the coffin.
 
**Tonelico:**
Have you said your goodbyes to Totrot? I see, that's quite a promise...
 
**Tonelico:**
Let me explain one thing. When we change from the Fairy Calendar to the Queen's Calendar...
 
**Tonelico:**
...any information added in the 'new second' Fairy Calendar will be erased.
 
**Tonelico:**
The Queen's Calendar is a continuation of the results of the 'second time'. The 'first' or 'new second' will cease to be.
 
**Tonelico:**
The only thing to pass over unchanged is you, who will continue to sleep securely in this coffin.
 
**Tonelico:**
I'm sure when I live another 400 years and change to the Queen's Calendar, even I will forget you.
 
**Tonelico:**
That is, I'm sure to return to the 'second' version of me. So&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
Any fairy that may try to bring memories of this 'new second' Fairy Calendar into the Queen's Calendar...
 
**Tonelico:**
...will be recognized by the world as something different, not belonging to the 'second' Fairy Calendar.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
The 'second time'&mdash;were you never here in the real history...?
 
**Tonelico:**
Let's take steps to prevent this from happening.
 
**Tonelico:**
As long as nobody realizes the contradiction in history, you should be able to survive.
 
**Tonelico:**
In any case, what I'm about to say will be forgotten as long as I'm in Britain, so it's not an issue.
 
**Tonelico:**
Listen, Galahad... Here are the circumstances for after you awaken.
 
**Tonelico:**
If you and the rest of Chaldea are able to tear down the Fairy Kingdom that Morgan built...
 
**Tonelico:**
...then the battle awaiting you in the Lostbelt is the same one that awaits me.
 
**Tonelico:**
A coming to terms with your spirit, and an analysis of your life.
 
**Tonelico:**
You had a reason to fight, but insufficient will to do so.
 
**Tonelico:**
You were running away from the power to hurt the world and to hurt others, unconsciously deeming it a bad thing.
 
**Tonelico:**
But people all have the freedom to hurt others, and also bear the responsibility for it.
 
**Tonelico:**
Humans aren't out to do the 'right thing'. You're creatures who keep trying to make the best choice for a 'better tomorrow'.
 
**Tonelico:**
And...there is no right choice to make, however many people it may save.
 
**Tonelico:**
Since there is no right choice, you must decide with your own will what to protect and what to defeat.
 
**Tonelico:**
You're going to know a lot more people's hearts in the future.
 
**Tonelico:**
A heart that tries to understand. / Don't give up, don't give in.
 
**Tonelico:**
A heart that tries to accept. / Don't discourage, don't detest.
 
**Tonelico:**
A heart that tries to repel. / Untainted, unbanished.
 
**Tonelico:**
But not even the best of us have a heart free of conflict.
 
**Tonelico:**
Every heart has a battle inside. Please don't turn a blind eye to yours.
 
**Tonelico:**
When the empty space in your chest is filled by your own reason to fight&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
The Heroic Spirit Galahad will once more entrust his being to you.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
&mdash;No heart free of conflict&mdash; &mdash;No matter whose it is&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
Yeah. You'll probably forget this by the time you wake up, but try to remember when the time comes.
 
**Tonelico:**
Will you change into something different, like I did? Or will you remain as you are and keep developing?
 
**Tonelico:**
That's the one thing in the future I can't predict.
 
**Tonelico:**
So, here's where I leave you. Oh, but be careful.
 
**Tonelico:**
Because when you wake up, I won't know any of this if you see me again.
 
**Tonelico:**
If you were swallowed by the Water Mirror at Norwich, you might want to think about the coffin that remains here.
 
**Tonelico:**
You might come to realize the purpose of what the coffin is for.
 
**Tonelico:**
Probably because, I won't be Tonelico anymore in that future time.
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
...T&ndash;
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
Thank you for everything you've done, Tonelico! Even if the conclusion was foregone&mdash;
 
**The First Fairy Knight:**
I wholeheartedly believe your journey brought no shame to the name of Savior!
 
**Tonelico:**
Well, sure! We gave it our best, didn't we?
 
**Tonelico:**
Goodbye, brave knight from the confirmed future. In respect to your deeds, I will reveal my secret to you.
 
**Tonelico:**
Tonelico the Savior is only a pseudonym. It was the name my stepmother gave me when Orkney was destroyed.
 
**Tonelico:**
My true name is Morgan.
 
**Tonelico:**
The Fairy of Paradise—Avalon le Fae—who drifted from the Inner Sea of the Planet with a mission to save Britain.
 
**Tonelico:**
And in pan-human history, the witch who destroyed Britain in her bitter rivalry with King Arthur.
 
**Tonelico:**
In a distant future, this is the name of the Lostbelt King whom you and Chaldea must defeat.

Yeah... Welcome back for real, Mash.|

**Mash:**
Yes&mdash;Mash Kyrielight has finally returned.
 
**Mash:**
It's been such a long journey&mdash;and I have so much to tell you.
 
**Mash:**
About Sheffield, the Fairy Calendar, and&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
The story of the savior Tonelico, who brought me here&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
Just like that, Fujimaru was reunited with her.
 
**Narration:**
{(M)He/(F)She} held her after she was released from the coffin.
 
**Narration:**
A quiet, caring embrace respecting each other's mutual presence.
 
**Narration:**
When I saw that bright/dazzling scene, I breathed a sigh of relief/thankfulness.
 
**Narration:**
A magus from the world of humans.
 
**Narration:**
A {(M)boy/(F)girl} forced into the leading role by those around {(M)him/(F)her}, not of {(M)his/(F)her} own free will.
 
**Narration:**
Though there were times I had lied, deceived, bungled, and shown other shortcomings.
 
**Narration:**
It was obvious you were putting up a tough front and holding back frustrations, so I couldn't leave well enough alone and followed you.
 
**Narration:**
I'm glad. Fujimaru had a friend {(M)he/(F)she} really cared about, didn't {(M)he/(F)she}?
 
**Narration:**
After all, that's the story everyone around here has had faith in.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;There's no way they could've been like me.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Mash:**
That's all. That was the Britain I experienced personally.
 
**Mash:**
There was a first and a second Fairy Calendar.
 
**Mash:**
The savior Tonelico was a fairy who has stayed alive for 6,000 years, and is also Queen Morgan.
 
**Mash:**
Tonelico couldn't do it, but Queen Morgan is able to Rayshift.
 
**Mash:**
And she gave herself the title “Fairy of Paradise.”
 
**Mash:**
Was all this information useful to everybody?
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's complicated. At the very least we can guess now how the Queen's Calendar, or even how the Fairy Kingdom came about.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Can we? I mean, I, uh...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I can't help but wonder if island nations do nothing but fall into civil wars.
 
**Da Vinci:**
What, you think Europe is any different?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Doesn't matter where, war will break out over land, faith, and the disparity of wealth.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Because they don't have neighbors...or invaders therefrom, island countries will always fall into conflict within their own borders.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Still, Britain is as strange as expected.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The island is small, there weren't any humans, and it had foreigners settled on it in the form of the northern fairies...
 
**Da Vinci:**
There were a lot of problems to get around, but it should have been unified sooner than it was.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And yet war always broke out in the Fairy Calendar. No matter how many times the Savior tried to stop it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And the reason for that being&mdash;do you know, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Calamity?|
 
**Da Vinci:**
No, that's also a trigger for conflict, but as it's a deeper issue we're setting it aside for now.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Fairy of Paradise?
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's right. The “Fairy of Paradise,” Avalon le Fae.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Aside from territorial disputes, the clans were split evenly on how to deal with her.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
What is a “Fairy of Paradise” in the first place? If we don't clear that up, we can't discuss it.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Isn't that right, Artoria? You've known since the day you were born...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
No, start talking about the mission you were given at birth, here and now.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Grimm, you're being too harsh.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
O-oh, didn't I mention it? How strange, I must have just been careless.
 
**Artoria:**
Then let's talk about it here. I mean, it's not like it's a secret or anything.
 
**Artoria:**
“Fairies of Paradise,” as the name implies, are fairies dispatched from the Inner Sea of the planet... from Avalon.
 
**Artoria:**
Exactly why though is a little vague.
 
**Artoria:**
I just heard a single voice when I was born. “Go to Britain, and make things right.”
 
**Artoria:**
That was all I was given.
 
**Artoria:**
I'm sure it was the same for the generation that came before...for the lake fairies.
 
**Artoria:**
“Fairies of Paradise” are said to be “seeds of a star” that flowed down from Paradise to earth.
 
**Artoria:**
If one of these is lucky enough to reach the ground, it sprouts as a juvenile.
 
**Artoria:**
It then grows up as a human does until reaching adulthood.
 
**Artoria:**
For that reason, they're called “growing fairies,”  hated by some and loved by others.
 
**Artoria:**
Tonelico—Morgan—was probably one of those “star seeds” that washed up here in Orkney.
 
**Artoria:**
The head of the Rain Clan raised her as a daughter, and Orkney was destroyed.
 
**Artoria:**
I think that I washed ashore in the Lake District, but the head of the Mirror Clan threw me back into the sea.
 
**Artoria:**
Luckily, I was saved by the people of Tintagel... at least, I think that's how it went.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So there are clans hostile to the Fairies of Paradise...?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yes, but not all of them.
 
**Artoria:**
At the very least, the head of the Rain Clan raised Morgan as if she were family.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
And as a result, the other clans formed an alliance and destroyed Orkney.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The clans, especially the highborn members, hate and fear the Fairies of Paradise.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Because&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They don't want a "new clan"?|
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No, that can't be the case, can it? The Rain Clan was replaced by the King's Clan. after all.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
There's precedent for switching clans. They can't hate doing it all that much.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's where what we talked about earlier comes in. The “presence of outsiders”.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Because they're not born in Britain?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
&mdash;Yeah. They may be fairies, but they're not British fairies.
 
**Da Vinci:**
From where the clans stand, Morgan and Artoria are invaders from the foreign land of Paradise&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Actually, it's more like they're the legitimate heirs to the island.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Rain Clan heard the “voice of Paradise” and followed its emissary.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Morgan is the rightful sovereign of this island.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Pilgrimage was most likely a rite to return Britain to its rightful ruler.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But the other clans didn't accept it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And so Orkney was destroyed through an alliance of Wind, Earth, Fang, and Wing.
 
**Mash:**
Yes... That's what happened in the year 4000 of the fairy calendar, the fall of Orkney.
 
**Mash:**
The Fairy of Paradise survived the war, took up the name of Tonelico, and began a journey to save Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. That's probably the point.
 
**Mash:**
Da Vinci?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right, let's break this down.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Sorry Artoria, but for the sake of convenience I'll be using our own pre-era calendar, B.C.
 
**Da Vinci:**
12000 B.C.: The British Lostbelt is created, a world of fairies alone.
 
**Da Vinci:**
11000 B.C.: Most likely when the first Great Calamity occured.
 
**Da Vinci:**
6000 B.C.: The lands of Britain extend to where Scotland should be.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There is a confrontation with the northern fairies, who survived in the forest created by Albion's corpse. The Spring War begins.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Later, the Rain and Mirror Clans establish kingdoms on the grounds where the Spring War was fought.
 
**Da Vinci:**
4000 B.C.: The Fairy of Paradise washes ashore in Orkney. Orkney is then destroyed by the alliance of the other clans.
 
**Da Vinci:**
2000 B.C.: The northern fairies once more make landfall after having hidden themselves on the Western Island, Ireland.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Summer War begins. The clans are almost annihilated, but are saved by Tonelico's intercession.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The northern fairies are welcomed as a new clan, the King's Clan.
 
**Da Vinci:**
400 B.C.: An armed uprising dedicated to coexistence with humans flares up, under the banner of the Round Table. The Autumn War begins.
 
**Da Vinci:**
In the end, the human knight Uther defeats the clans, and is recognized as the first ruler of a unified Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
However, on the day of his coronation in Londinium, the Round Table collapses due to internal strife.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Uther is poisoned, Tonelico is executed, and the Savior never appears in Britain again.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And then, 1 B.C.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Great Calamity kills off all the fairies in Britain and ends the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's a rough summary of the events of the Fairy Calendar based on what we've learned so far.
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So? What was the point?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Isn't it obvious? The divergence point between the two of them.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The first one...I guess you could call it the original history.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Here, the Fairy of Paradise would have been killed during the destruction of Orkney in 4000 B.C.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And what happens because of that? Based on multiple flashpoints,
 
**Da Vinci:**
by 1 B.C., Britain would become a dead land.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There might be a few survivors, but they would not be able to get their numbers back to thrive as a species.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Most likely, nothing would happen for the next 2,000 years aside from the expansion of wilderness.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Without any civilization to emulate, it would just be a land of low-class fairies barely managing to scrape by.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But in 4000 B.C., if the Fairy of Paradise survives, it becomes the Fairy Kingdom we know.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I see...All because they protected Britain.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's right. And in 1 B.C., 90% of the fairies die to the Great Calamity.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The butcher's bill for Londinium is paid. The Great Calamity grows to a state far too large to be controlled.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The city-devouring Beast of Calamity. The land-destroying Flames of Calamity.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Those two destroyed this Lostbelt, according to the first Grimm's records. But...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Morgan managed to start again “afterwards,”  though I'm not sure exactly how.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Presumably by using magecraft strong enough to wither a Fantasy Tree.
 
**Da Vinci:**
She pulled Britain back from the brink at the last second, and revived it as the Fairy Kingdom of Britain.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah. The fairies on the edge of extinction rose again as the “next generation”.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Within a few months, Britain was restored to its original state, and the clans started fighting again.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
&mdash;Then, an invader strong enough to make them all tremble appeared.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
From the farthest reaches of the forgotten land of Orkney, accompanied by a storm, she came.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Once again the clans banded together to fight her, but her power was overwhelming.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Britain was conquered by a single fairy, and to symbolize her rule, she built her castle of Camelot aside the Great Pit.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Her name was Morgan. The name of the conflict was the Winter War.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The first year of the Queen's Calendar...or as you might know better, the first year of the Common Era.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
But, that's not the point.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
How it happened doesn't matter, the fact is that Morgan is a threat to pan-human history that has to be defeated.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Take her down, and set right the Britain turned Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
As a Fairy of Paradise just like her, that's something only you can do, Artoria.
 
**Artoria:**
Y-yeah...I guess so, huh...hahaha....
 
**Artoria:**
Uh...what do you think, Mash? Do you want to fight her?
 
**Mash:**
I...to fight Tonelico...no, Queen Morgan...
 
**Mash:**
...I'll do it. Boggart, Rob, Wag, Winkie...
 
**Mash:**
I promised so many that I would save the fairies of Britain.
 
**Mash:**
I will talk to the Queen, and if I have no choice but to fight her in the end, I will use all of my strength to do so.
 
**Mash:**
I am a friend of Tonelico the Savior, not a knight of Queen Morgan.
 
**Artoria:**
I-I see...you're so level headed...
 
**Habetrot:**
Done talking now? Then let's ring the bell and get back to Britain already.
 
**Habetrot:**
It's freezing here. Also, aren't Percival and the others gonna get worried?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, that's right! Habenyan!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, Habetrot is here too!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Habe...who?
 
**Mash:**
Oh, are you a local collaborator working with Senpai? I'm glad to meet you 
 
**Habetrot:**
No need to be so formal. I'm just here for the ride, so no need to worry.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wha...Habetrot?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are you saying?
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
What do you mean “what am I saying”?
 
**Habetrot:**
Did I ever say that she and I met or were friends in the first place?
 
**Habetrot:**
I'm just here as a guide. Now that my job is done, I'm just gonna relax and enjoy what comes next.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's true, we don't know very much about Habetrot.
 
**Da Vinci:**
She's a strange being who appeared out of nowhere and started supporting Fujimaru, but...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Why are you here then? You and Grimm seem to know each other.
 
**Habetrot:**
Oh, Grimm and I first met here. Isn't that right? You planned all this after all, didn't you?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Well...yeah. I did write the plot, I guess.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Great work, Habetrot! With this, everything's fallen into place.
 
**Habetrot:**
See? I'm worried about the Fairy Kingdom in my own way, even if I'm just a low-class fairy with no power.
 
**Habetrot:**
Now, ring the bell, Child of Prophecy.
 
**Habetrot:**
With this, you'll finally stand where Morgan stood.
 
**Artoria:**
I know...
 
**Artoria:**
Well no, I really don't know. But when you say it like that I can't really refuse.
 
**Artoria:**
“The song of Paradise. The Chant of the Inner Sea. That which is born chosen, predestined, confirmed.”
 
**Artoria:**
“The Bone Bell of Beginnings, showing the lost child the way home. &mdash;Their sins, be forgiven.”
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Getting back was pretty easy.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We made it all the way back to the mainland before nightfall.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
So are you going to Edinburgh from here, like you mentioned in Orkney?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah. We're going to negotiate with Knocknarea. She threw us out awfully quick last time...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Since then, Artoria's become the figurehead of the Round Table Army and she's rung four of the Pilgrim's Bells.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The two of them seem to be old friends, so we should be able to talk to her now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Isn't that right, Artoria?
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Eh?
 
**Artoria:**
Ah, what? We're&mdash;at the coast of ashes...?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something on your mind?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Ah...right, we've already made it back. I was a little out of it.
 
**Artoria:**
So did the bell ring? Am I any different this time?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Don't worry. The bell rang, and your Saint Graph grew stronger.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
No ordinary fairy could stand up to you now, though Morgan's still a bit out of your league.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Even Knocknarea can't complain about having you as an ally now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Let's head for Edinburgh with our heads held high! Anti-Queen alliance, unite!
 
**Artoria:**
(Anti-queen alliance, huh...)
 
**Artoria:**
(I admit if I teamed up with Knocknarea our military power would be about equal, and we'd have a decent chance of winning, but...)
 
**Artoria:**
(Her Majesty Morgan, the queen who defended Britain all by herself for 2,000 years...?)
 
**Artoria:**
(There's no way I could stand up to someone as strong as that, it's just too much for me...)
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
## Section 20: Choco Empire Edinburgh 
 
**Artoria:**
I hear the tolling of bells... I hear the sound of bones.
 
**Song of Prophecy:**
“Though the harbor returns to the water's edge, the Calamity heads for distant skies.”
 
**Artoria:**
A testament to the apologies of the fairies. The sound of souls accepting their sins.
 
**Song of Prophecy:**
“The round fortress shall burn out, the bell of the waters shall be revealed.”
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;And when all are rung...
 
**Song of Prophecy:**
“Upon the sinner who admits their guilt, the blade of decapitation is felled.”
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;The Fairy of Paradise will...
 
**Song of Prophecy:**
“Their duty fulfilled, the Child of Prophecy shall bid farewell to their place of origin.”
 
**D：Morgan:**
Indeed. I will not save the fairies. My kingdom alone is what will be protected.
 
**Narration:**
I will save the fairies. I will remain faithful to the duty conferred to me.
 
**D：Morgan:**
There is no need to fear the Great Calamity with the amount of magical energy stored in this throne.
 
**D：Morgan:**
Furthermore&mdash;only a chosen fairy may rule from this throne.
 
**Narration:**
A testament to the pilgrimage's completion. That throne is the key to maintaining Britain.
 
**Narration:**
The lynchpin of paradise—Avalon le Fae.
 
**Morgan:**
You are one of them. You are different from the other fairies or the outsiders.
 
**Morgan:**
Neither a rebel nor an invader, but an arbitrator chosen by the Staff of Selection.
 
**Morgan:**
You are justified in seeking my defeat. There is no sin in fighting me, nor in the rivers of blood that will be shed as a result.
 
**Narration:**
I have been chosen. I am different both from the fairies of Britain, and different from the King of Knights from Pan-human History.
 
**Narration:**
Neither rebel nor invader. I will not bear any sin for inciting conflict and killing the fairies.
 
**Morgan:**
If you wish to save Britain, then defeat me and take my place on the throne.
 
**Morgan:**
Fulfill that foolish prophecy. You should know better than anyone that it is the only way.
 
**Narration:**
That's right, it's the only way to save Britain. I have to defeat Morgan, the Fairy of Paradise who abandoned her task.
 
**Artoria:**
...and then what?
 
**Artoria:**
What comes after I do what I never wanted to do&ndash;after I do what I never wished for?
 
**Artoria:**
Where should the I, a Fairy of Paradise, return to...?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Good morning, everyone! Glad we could rendezvous earlier than expected!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In the middle of the road...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Red Rab-bit awaited us, just like Benkei.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Hah!? Senpai, Da Vinci! Who is this that looks identical to Red Hare!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, that's Red Rab-bit. He's a native fairy and a dependable companion of ours now. Don't worry, he doesn't bite.
 
**Mash:**
I-is that so? Nice to meet you, Red Rab-bit.
 
**Mash:**
My name is Mash Kyrielight. I look forward to working with you.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
The pleasure's all mine, bashful lady. A polite greeting, palatable indeed.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But didn't you say you'd be waiting in Edinburgh?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
That was the plan, but I get restless if I don't sprint.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
I figured I could meet up with you if I waited on the way out from the ashen coast. Hahaha.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Now then, hop on the chariot. I shall promise a comfortable trip to Her Majesty's city of Edinburgh.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That sounds mighty fine, I'd just about grown tired of walking! My legs give out when I'm in the spellcasting class!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Hmm? Please wait a moment. You over there. You're an unfamiliar face, may I ask who you are?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The name's Grimm. I'm an acquaintance of Fujimaru's. Pleased to meet you.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Fujimaru's acquaintance......Ban Heman History's......
 
**Mash:**
Did you mean to say Pan-human History?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Yes. Pan-human History. Thank you, Mash. Such deft consideration, I might just get hooked.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come here for a minute, Mash.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't spoil Red Rab-bit too much.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes. I haven't quite grasped how close everyone is yet, but I'll be cautious.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
If he's an old friend from Pan-human History, would you say Master Muramasa and Master Grimm are similar?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Hm? Yeah, categorically speaking, I guess? What about it?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
No, it's just my animal instincts are telling me you two are rather close, so this might be a pointless question but...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
If Master Muramasa and Master Grimm were to fight, who would come out on top?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What are you doing asking something you already know the answer to! Obviously, it's me!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah, totally! It's such a pointless question! Ten out of ten people would say it's me!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That's right! What's with this idiotic prattling!? Get over here, I'll let you off with a slash from the blunt edge.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Sounds great! It's good for nothing anyway, so you'd be better off using it as a club. See, you get it!
 
**The Strongest Pair:**
Hahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahaha!
 
**The Strongest Pair:**
Alright, let's go for a round!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Artoria:**
Both fighters disqualified! Strong people don't quarrel in the first place!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria makes a good point...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is just how versus stuff goes...
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Man...it's not like I was losing, okay?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That bastard Grimm loses because he has no support skills despite being a mage, okay?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I just didn't think there could possibly be a warrior who can't even defend himself!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Even Vikings have Guts!
 
**Artoria:**
Get on the chariot already! We better get to Edinburgh before nightfall!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Play nice and get on the chariot. Grimm's wolves... can tail us.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But the chariot holds six and there are seven of us. We're one too many. Should I skate along?
 
**Habetrot:**
In that case, I'll ride on Red Rab-bit's back. You don't mind, do you?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
That might work. At your size, it shouldn't impact my performance any.
 
**Mash:**
But...the north is chilly. Maybe I should just run along&mdash;
 
**Habetrot:**
Don't sweat it. I'm used to the north's cold. Now, let's be off, Fujimaru.
 
**Habetrot:**
There used to be a settlement of fairies in Edinburgh, but I don't know what's happened since the Queen's Calendar began.
 
**Habetrot:**
Well, Knocknarea hates humans so it can't be much more than a campfire gathering though!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Northern Fairy:**
Attention, people of Edinburgh! Lady Knocknarea has returned! For the time being, she is home!
 
**Northern Fairy:**
Starting today, she will be resting at the tomb of the former queen to regain her strength, after which she will return to the front lines!
 
**Northern Fairy:**
Businesses on the main road may stay open after dark! Keep all the lamps burning!
 
**Northern Fairy:**
Lady Knocknarea loves a nightless city! May the King's Clan and the City of the Queen prosper!
 
**Main Street Merchant:**
Aaahhhh, war at last! I can't wait! It's been far too long!
 
**Main Street Merchant:**
I fled the south ten years ago, and now I'm a member of the King's Clan!
 
**Main Street Merchant:**
Knocknarea shares her power even with a nobody like me!
 
**Main Street Merchant:**
For her sake, I'll do anything! I'm having a fire sale, so name your price and I'll give it to you!
 
**Shopping Fairy:**
Do you have the latest news? Can I see it?
 
**Shopping Fairy:**
“The 29th military exercise has come to an end. Victory for the north.”
 
**Shopping Fairy:**
“The writer cannot help but shiver at the dreadful precision making up our King's Clan's main force.”
 
**Shopping Fairy:**
“The much-maligned Giant Corps were able to show its true potential.”
 
**Shopping Fairy:**
“Even Camelot's walls will be destroyed in a matter of hours in the face of a force strong enough to annihilate a large group of Mors.”
 
**Shopping Fairy:**
“According to 1st Division Commander Gervais: 'Capturing Camelot would be simple with our current strength'.”
 
**Shopping Fairy:**
“'Should the war start, it will take us but a day, maybe two, or perhaps three, but most likely four to attain victory.”
 
**Shopping Fairy:**
Hmm. Not very reassuring, but Lady Knocknarea will be leading from the front, won't she?
 
**Shopping Fairy:**
Then there's no way we'll lose! She's the Queen of Victory, who never fights a battle she can't win in the first place!
 
**Fairy Soldiers:**
Lady Knocknarea is always looking for those willing to work! Military service, medical treatment, clerical work, transportation, manufacturing, doesn't matter what you can do, you're hired!
 
**Fairy Soldiers:**
You're guaranteed the compensation appropriate for your ambition! Everything else depends on your spirit!
 
**Fairy Soldiers:**
If there are any more fairies with Mors disease, I want you to immediately place them under protection and bring them here.
 
**Fairy Soldiers:**
It's treatable if you catch it in the early stages. I'm a survivor of it, myself.
 
**Fairy Soldiers:**
Like Queen Morgan, Lady Knocknarea doesn't place value on whether you're a highborn or lowborn fairy.
 
**Fairy Soldiers:**
She just respects those who have the will to live!
 
**Fairy Soldiers:**
The King's Clan believes in their people and gives freely, they deserve to be Britain's next rulers!

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wow.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Whoa.
 
**Da Vinci:**
*whistle*
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is the evil empire...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Knocknarea's pushing for an all-out empire...!
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
I don't believe this, these are the northerners!? They're more prosperous than Salisbury!
 
**Habetrot:**
What the hell went down during the Queen's Calendar!?
 
**D：Grimm the Wise:**
No kidding. I was surprised too when I came here before. After all, the original records said:
 
**D：Grimm the Wise:**
“The fairies of the north are a tribe of nomads and never stay in one place for very long”!
 
**D：Grimm the Wise:**
The King's Clan...I guess Mab was a pretty capable leader.
 
**D：Grimm the Wise:**
In the span of a single generation, she built this city with not only the northern fairies, but also southerners who trickled up north.
 
**D：Grimm the Wise:**
It's built strong enough that it would put the pan-human history's Edinburgh to shame.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Kinda pisses me off that you're so proud of something you had nothing to do with...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But you're right that it's a bustling city. The flow of people and trade are so brisk.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So there's a cathedral here too.|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. In our world, Edinburgh is home to Saint Giles' Cathedral.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I suppose that similarity is due to the convergence with human history,
 
**Da Vinci:**
but the exact location is different from pan-human history.
 
**Da Vinci:**
This Edinburgh is built on a rocky hill.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Unfortunately, neither Calton Hill or Arthur's Seat probably exist in the fairy kingdom.
 
**Artoria:**
...?
 
**Artoria:**
Mash, Mash. Do you know what Arthur's Seat is?
 
**Mash:**
Yes, though I've never seen it. Arthur's Seat is a famous tourist attraction.
 
**Mash:**
It's a steep rocky hill just outside of Edinburgh.
 
**Mash:**
There is a legend that King Arthur once sat there, so it's called Arthur's Seat.
 
**Artoria:**
I-I see. King Arthur's legend is everywhere, huh.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. It's very popular, so it features in a lot of major tourist attractions. Winchester, Glastonbury...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Tintagel in Cornwall is especially famo&ndash;
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, by the way, about negotiating with Knocknarea. They said she had come back here.
 
**Artoria:**
You think she's in the castle? She has to be. Are we attacking it?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Y-yeah. We are definitely her enemies.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Getting an audience won't be easy...wait a minute.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(Hey, Fujimaru. Artoria's acting like a wild beast again...)
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(I give up...this whole thing was Oberon's plan anyway...)
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(Just look at her face.)
 
**Artoria:**
Finally, a chance to beat up Knocknarea! She'll taste all my years of jealousy!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I just hope she doesn't try to break down the front door...|
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No kidding. We haven't even settled on a cover story yet...how are we gonna do this...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe we can just say we're fans of hers?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Fans...are you thinking straight? Did you get enough sleep?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Um...everyone? I'm very sorry to cause you trouble, but...
 
**Mash:**
We've been surrounded for some time, so...
 
**Mash:**
No matter how you look at it, we're trapped. It looks like we'll have to fight...
 
**Artoria:**
See! I knew this orderly city was complete bunk!
 
**Artoria:**
This is Knocknarea's land, where they just attack strangers without reason!
 
**Artoria:**
Everyone, prepare to counterattack! First we'll break through this, then we'll assault her castle!
 
**Edinburgh Guards:**
We have been waiting for you. Artoria, the Child of Prophecy, and her party correct?
 
**Edinburgh Guards:**
I know you are tired after your long journey, but please try to compose yourself.
 
**Edinburgh Guards:**
Lady Knocknarea is waiting for you. Will you please come to the cathedral?
 
**Artoria:**
Eh.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Oh, that's right. I made an appointment before we arrived.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
“Greetings, Your Majesty, Queen of the North Knocknarea. We will come to call on you tomorrow, so please be ready. Signed: A Horse.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
It was such a paltry missive, but she responded quite promptly.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
“As Queen, I shall gracefully meet with the Child of Prophecy. Respectfully yours.”
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Well, I had thought that the fairies of the north were barbarians who solved everything through force,
 
**Red Rabbit:**
but Queen Knocknarea is a magnificent individual!
 
**Artoria:**
I-is that so? Well, she went to all this trouble, so we may as well go see her...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Wait, she just meekly accepted the invitation? Seriously? She's not going to try to break down my door or anything?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh shi&ndash;Everyone, get out of here! I want you out the back door in two seconds! Hurry!
 
**???:**
Are you sure?
 
**???:**
Just a second ago weren't you proudly declaring throughout the cathedral:
 
**???:**
“She's definitely gotten a big head now that she's rung four bells. I'll show her that I won't lose to some Child of Prophecy, oh ho ho ho ho.”
 
**Knocknarea:**
There's been a change of plans, alright!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
I mean how would I look if I showed up with a full platoon and they came in unarmed!? That's just vulgar!
 
**???:**
Seriously? You're worried about your dignity now? What are you, an apple that didn't get picked during harvest?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Haa, you calling me rotten? Sounds like someone's asking for a good. old. beating.
 
**???:**
Welp, I'm outta here~☆
 
**Edinburgh Guards:**
Thank you for your patience... Now, please enter the cathedral.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...seems like...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's a mental battle being waged at the same level...
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, you've made quite the grand entrance, haven't you, Artoria?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Seems like you went out and learned a little more self-confidence, courage, and decorum, did you?
 
**Artoria:**
Why are you wasting time with small talk, Knocknarea? We just heard all the soldiers rushing out in a panic a second ago.
 
**Knocknarea:**
You heard nothing, those were my footsteps. That's the end of it!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Hm...? One, three, five, seven...Oberon aside, aren't you missing someone?
 
**Knocknarea:**
That puffy-cheeked girl, who scarfed down my chocolate with glee. Gareth, was it?
 
**Artoria:**
Gareth...no, Gareth the Knight is off protecting Londinium right now.
 
**Artoria:**
There's no way she would set foot in such an evil empire.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, that's too bad. I was thinking of giving her a tour of the chocolate factory.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Next time, I guess...Anyway, you all went to Orkney without telling me.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The north belongs to me and the King's Clan. No matter the reason, trespassing is forbidden.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Sheesh, you're not bandits living in the mountains... looks like you still don't get your position.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If we told you, would you have seen us off?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We went through the Lake District.
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
...? Knocknarea? Why'd you freeze up?
 
**Knocknarea:**
I didn't! Hey, what are you guards doing!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
You let a human into the cathedral! You're getting the “special reward” later!
 
**Artoria:**
Uh...what exactly is...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Ah, Fujimaru. You seem to be doing well. That's very good to see.
 
**Knocknarea:**
She's awfully reckless, isn't she? I can only guess what she's put you through by now.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Shall I get you an appointment at a high-end beauty salon later?
 
**Artoria:**
That's none of your business. Fujimaru isn't that frail to begin with.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I hate to break up a meeting between good friends, but you do know that Orkney's bell has been rung, don't you?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
We'd better speak quickly. Orkney's bell belonged to the Rain Clan,
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
but the King's Clan has inherited its position from them.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
So looking at it from the outside...from Morgan's viewpoint, that means that the King's Clan acknowledges the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You do know what that means, don't you?
 
**Knocknarea:**
What do you...wait, who exactly are you?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I'm Grimm. The second, actually.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I'm the one who took care of Orkney's bell here in Britain, in place of Merlinus Ambrosius.
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Shoot, we forgot! If she's Queen Medb&mdash;!)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Oh yeah! Medb was&mdash;)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Grimm, get out of here!
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
Ah, Grimm the Wise. I've heard of you from the previous queen.
 
**Knocknarea:**
She said: “that ruthless man will definitely show up.”  You were the savior Tonelico's magecraft teacher, weren't you?
 
**Knocknarea:**
I see. If even Grimm has appeared, I guess you're the genuine Savior.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Huh? Are you alright, Knocknarea? Do your Saint Graphs not recognize each other?
 
**Knocknarea:**
...? What are you talking about? Do I have some sort of history with him?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Nope. Nothing of the sort.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You are Knocknarea. The proud Queen of the North.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Your life here takes precedence, not some insignificant fate in human history.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Well&mdash;I'm actually glad about that part.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Is that so? I don't quite understand, but thank you. Your smile just now was quite pleasant.
 
**Knocknarea:**
More importantly, Grimm's right. Now that Orkney's bell has been rung, I've reached a turning point.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I received an ultimatum from Queen Morgan this morning.
 
**Knocknarea:**
“When the Child of Prophecy returns from Orkney as she sets foot upon the shore of ash, kill her.”
 
**Knocknarea:**
“If you cannot do so, the pact made with the previous King's Clan will be broken.”
 
**Knocknarea:**
That was it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
A pact made with the previous generation...? What's that all about?
 
**Knocknarea:**
That's none of your business. All you need to know is she's saying “kill the Child of Prophecy, or I declare war.”
 
**Knocknarea:**
I've been preparing to go to war against her from the very start, so I don't really care about that, but&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
The problem is you, Artoria. Do you remember what I said before?
 
**Artoria:**
Have an army. Ring at least two bells. Show the dignity becoming of the Child of Prophecy. Right?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Must be pretty frustrating for you to say it, huh? It was worth dealing with each other.
 
**Knocknarea:**
And you cleared every single one. You're worthy to join forces with me now.
 
**Knocknarea:**
That's why you stopped by Edinburgh, isn't it?
 
**Knocknarea:**
An alliance between the King's Clan and the Child of Prophecy. Not bad, not bad.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That was so easy!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You did it, Artoria!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
No...Knocknarea isn't such a pushover.
 
**Artoria:**
That's the face of someone who licks their lips while strangling a person who just let down their guard!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I would never make that face!
 
**Knocknarea:**
But you're right...I may be a honey fairy, but I'm not so sweet myself.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'll form an alliance with you. But it goes without saying that I'm in charge here.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The condition is that you're under my command. I'll be giving the orders now.
 
**Knocknarea:**
And I'll only accept fairies as an allied army. As for the humans in the Round Table Army&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'll turn them all into bees and put them to work in my chocolate factories, or something.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If war breaks out, they'd be the first to die anyway. Wouldn't they be happier that way?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Wait, Fujimaru. You don't have to say anything.
 
**Artoria:**
The Round Table Army is the greatest military force in Britain.
 
**Artoria:**
Me serving under you is about as impossible as a fallen apple returning to the tree.
 
**Artoria:**
If you want us to serve you, you're gonna have to force us, Knocknarea!
 
**Artoria:**
You and me, one on one! Show me what you've got!
 
**Knocknarea:**
All right, fine then! I accept your challenge!
 
**Knocknarea:**
A battle to determine the next queen of Britain—her throne, her pride, and her beauty at stake!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I swear on the name of my predecessor to fight fairly as a single fairy!
 
**Knocknarea:**
The winner claims the sole right to command the entire army, and the loser is forced into submission!
 
**Knocknarea:**
And as an added bonus, the winner takes the foreign magus as a consort!
 
**Mash:**
WHA&mdash;!?
 
**Artoria:**
...? I didn't quite catch that last part, but you're on!
 
**Artoria:**
So how are we competing this time!? Chocolate packing like before!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Heh&mdash;of course not.
 
**Knocknarea:**
This is Edinburgh. The headquarters of all the sweets distributed throughout Britain.
 
**Knocknarea:**
In a battle for pride and beauty, the method has already been decided.
 
**Knocknarea:**
“Valentine Mab Match”&mdash;the ancient and revered tradition of a fiery baking contest!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A fiery|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
baking contest.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Umm...what?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh, don't you know? Well...you are a country girl to the bone...
 
**Artoria:**
Enough with that already! Don't underestimate me just because I'm from the sticks!
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, I refrained from commenting since this is a negotiation between Knocknarea and Artoria,
 
**Mash:**
but as a member of Chaldea this concerns me too, so I have a question!
 
**Mash:**
What exactly is a Mab Match!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
(Huh. She's got as much magical energy as a Fairy Knight...black armor and a huge shield...could she be from Sheffield?)
 
**Knocknarea:**
Very well. I'll forgive your rudeness. The Mab Match is the last will and testament of our previous ruler, Queen Mab.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The law of “whoever makes the most delicious chocolate is queen.” Crazy, isn't it?
 
**K:?:**
And the judge will be me, the chocolate fairy! Devil Caren is here!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is this&mdash;!|
 

---

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Devil Caren:**
Both have qualified! A Mab Match shall be held, in the name of the chocolate fairy!
 
**Devil Caren:**
The contest will be decided tomorrow at noon! The allocated cooking time starts now until then!
 
**Devil Caren:**
Both players are required to use the kitchen provided in the cathedral. You may elect one other fairy as an assistant.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Are we clear?
 
**Knocknarea:**
You bet. There's someone I want to give it to this time, so my motivation's at an all-time high.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'll make it the chocolate of the year. The likes of which you won't see even in Gloucester.
 
**Artoria:**
Wait a minute, are we really going to make chocolate!? Are we actually going to decide who's superior with that!?
 
**Devil Caren:**
Yes, we will! That is the law of Edinburgh which spans 1,600 years.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Now then, Lady Artoria will be assigned the Star Kitchen and Lady Knocknarea will be assigned the Moon Kitchen.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Accommodations will be provided for Lady Artoria's companions.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Duelists are not permitted to interact in the kitchen, but you may act freely outside.
 
**Devil Caren:**
May you have an excellent time making chocolate. Fate smiles upon the devoted♡
 
**Mash:**
...and just like that, they went ahead and arranged accomodations for us...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash...if we're done here...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'd like you to go lend a hand...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I understand. Supporting Artoria, yes?
 
**Mash:**
I'm a Demi-Servant, but I'm treated as a fairy so it shouldn't be a problem.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes. That'd be great.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But before that, let's share information with each other. Just between members of Chaldea.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I've already heard about what happened after you were blasted away at Norwich, but I'd like to hear about what happened beforehand.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'd also like to discuss our actions thus far.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We won't be disturbed here. Not to mention, Muramasa and Grimm are in separate rooms.
 
**Mash:**
I see...so that's what happened. Salisbury, Gloucester, Londinium...
 
**Mash:**
Then Manchester and the Lake District. I understand the circumstances of the Round Table Army as well.
 
**Mash:**
But to think Pepe is here, and as a Count at that. I think it suits him very well!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Not just Pepe. Beryl's here too. We first ran into him at Camelot.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But you encountered him before us, didn't you, Mash?
 
**Mash:**
Yes...Once, in Sheffield. And then...
 
**Da Vinci:**
You lost the Black Barrel...Beryl must have retrieved it...
 
**Mash:**
I apologize, Da Vinci...to Sion too.
 
**Mash:**
Even though the two of you poured all your heart and soul into designing it......
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No worries. We just need to take it back.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's fine. We can come up with a trump card if need be.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I'm truly sorry...to tell the truth, back then...
 
**Da Vinci:**
You were still amnesiac due to the effect of the Nameless Forest, right?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Then it can't be helped. It's not worth your life. We can take our time searching for the Black Barrel later.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fortunately, it doesn't seem like we'll be needing it this time around.
 
**Mash:**
Is that so? No, it's for the best if we won't have to use it.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gadgets aren't working too well.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Child of Prophecy isn't half bad either, besides...
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yep. We have a power more reliable than the Black Barrel.
 
**Mash:**
Hm? Could it be something on the Shadow Border, that the new director Gordolf and Holmes have?
 
**Da Vinci:**
No, no. I'm talking about you, Mash. Ortenaus may be out of commission,
 
**Da Vinci:**
however, in exchange, your Saint Graph's output is in its prime. No, even greater.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's probably the rule of being a Fairy Knight. Barghest and the others have been gifted the names of the Round Table.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But in your case, you have received the gifted name of Fairy Knight Galahad on top of the power you originally borrowed from the Heroic Spirit Galahad.
 
**Da Vinci:**
In other words, you're worth Galahad-squared. Makes sense you'd be able to go toe-to-toe against Lancelot.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right now, Mash is close to being a High Servant. Truly the best of the best.
 
**Da Vinci:**
As her Master, you can feel that too, right Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right now, Mash is Super Mash.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My kouhai is super amazing.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;!
 
**Mash:**
T-that's right, t-t-then Kyrielight will do her super best!
 
**Senji Muramasa & Grimm:**
Heeey, we're heading out to tour the city, want to tag alooong?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Intelligence gathering, huh?
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
After all, unlike Artoria, who's stuck in the kitchen, we're free.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
We need to do at least that much. What about you, Da Vinci?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm going to take the day off. I still have to write up a report.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Where's Mash? Wasn't she with you?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's off to support Artoria.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash's skill with chocolates...is kind of awesome, you know?
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I see. Then we might just win this one. I figured I'd make it myself in case of an emergency.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You're far too soft on Artoria. What happened to being the Alien God's apostle?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Shut it, you boor. I'm still in debt for my life being bid for.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
And speak for yourself, you also had a soft spot for Knocknarea. Don't tell me she reminded you of an acquaintance?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah, but the resemblance is superficial. They're different people. She has nothing to do with me.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Knocknarea led her own life without being tossed about by the whims of the Human Order.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I follow my destiny, but that woman's mastered hers.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
She's such a free spirit&ndash;Can't blame me if I let a chuckle slip out, can you?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Heh, so the previous queen, Mab, vanished during year 400 of the Queen's Calendar. And Knocknarea was born 100 years ago in 1900.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So for almost 1500 years, this city didn't have a leader?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah, seems to have been the case. I also thought that was strange.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
But it seems like during that period, the northern fairies followed the decree of the previous queen.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That the 'next generation' of the King's Clan will eventually be born, and to obey Morgan until that time comes.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So since Knocknarea was born, the northern fairies have...|
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Of course, they've regained their past momentum. As a result, they ended up in a standoff against Morgan.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Knocknarea spent a century drilling discipline and doctrine into the northern fairies, building them up as an army.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
When Ainsel prophesied the coming of the Child of Prophecy, Morgan wasn't the only one who panicked.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Knocknarea must have been livid deep down as well.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
“I've spent a century preparing, like hell I'd let some fairy who popped up out of nowhere upstage me!”
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Ahh, I see. So that's why the queen gets along with Artoria so well.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Get along? Don't you mean they're on bad terms?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Like they love to hate each other?
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I suppose it's the weight of the responsibility they bear. One's the Child of the Queen and the other's the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
They probably didn't have anyone who could stand beside them. As in, their positions are different but they stand on equal footing.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I have no problem with either side winning this! Let's leave them be, Fujimaru!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Still, you're surprisingly knowledgeable, Grimm.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Is there anything else you know? Come on, spill it. Speaking of which, how did the Queen's City get its name?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I don't know how the name originated. This is the extent of what I know...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
...and we've wandered off the main road quite a bit...
 
**Habetrot:**
What's this? The three of you going for a walk together? Well, I suppose staying cooped up in your room since noon must've been boring.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
We were also taking this chance to go sightseeing in Edinburgh. I rarely visit the northern cities.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is this...the backstreet?|
 
**Habetrot:**
Not exactly...you'll understand when you see it, Fujimaru.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did something odd happen?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
No, not really...nothing in particular.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What's the matter, Red Rab-bit? It's not like you to stutter.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Well...I might just be imagining things...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
It's just that there are more Wind Fairies here than I expected.
 

---

 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
Ohh, a newcomer? Welcome to the Edinburgh Development Zone.
 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
This district is where the refugees who still haven't received a portion of Lady Knocknarea's 'power' live.
 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
Everyone holds citizenship though. We all have jobs, and the tents here all have roofs too.
 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
As soon as the war with the queen ends, I'm sure Lady Knocknarea will accept you all into the King's Clan.
 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
That's why there's nothing to fear. Feel free to set up a tent anywhere you like.
 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
If you're in luck, you might be able to get a job in the medical district. There's no need to fear the Mors disease.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Accepted into the King's Clan...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you mean by Mors disease?
 

---

 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
What!? A-are you human!?
 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
To bring a human into Edinburgh, how much of a risk-taker can one be!?
 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
If Knocknarea finds out about this&mdash;
 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
No, don't tell me...you guys are...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
No, sir. We are just travelling fairies. A breeze blowing past Edinburgh.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
We will be on our way tomorrow. Please don't mind us.
 
**Residents of Edinburgh:**
I-is that so? Sorry about holding you back then. I'll be off now...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That certainly wasn't a local. That is one dubious look.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Most likely Morgan's spy, wouldn't you say? In a city this big, there's bound to be a few rats.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Should we inform Knocknarea?|
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Let's not. This is just Muramasa's gut feeling. Can't go around accusing the locals without any evidence.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Rather, all the fairies around here have markings on their legs.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Either these fairies lost their place down south, lost their purpose or&mdash;
 
**Red Rabbit:**
...are criminals who broke the law. Fugitives, criminals, you say?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So this is a city for sinners, huh? Either its underbelly runs deep or it's in need of laborers...which is it?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Isn't it both? No matter what kind of fairy you are, you will return to the earth when you die.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
The more fairies you have tied down to that land, the more your territory will expand.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
It's been 1,600 years since the previous queen vanished. Edinburgh must have established itself as a city in this manner.
 
**Habetrot:**
Hmm...if that's the case, isn't it a little strange...
 
**Habetrot:**
If fairies have been living in this area for 1,600 years in the Queen's Calendar unlike the Fairy Calendar...
 
**Habetrot:**
Why hasn't anything on the border of Britain changed at all?
 
**Habetrot:**
This city, could it be...Mab would certainly do something like that...
 
**Habetrot:**
A city built in a single generation in the wilderness... the successor born 100 years ago...
 
**Habetrot:**
Oh no, it's starting to make sense...no wonder Morgan hasn't touched it...
 
**Habetrot:**
That Knocknarea fairy, under different circumstances, could've ended up as a Calamity...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Habetrot...?|
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
No...I must be overthinking it. There's no way something like that could be the case.
 
**Habetrot:**
Never mind, let's head back, Red Rab-bit. There's nothing but wilderness up ahead, nothing left to see.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Is that so? And just like that, you got on my back.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Of course, I did say you could get on...but aren't you heavier than you look?
 
**Habetrot:**
Nyahaha, I'm packed on the inside---!
 
**Habetrot:**
Habenyan's going to become an adult with a nice body one day!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
You're the type of fairy that doesn't grow, aren't you?
 
**Habetrot:**
Don't wander around too much, Fujimaru, okay?
 
**Habetrot:**
Knocknarea may have accepted you, but if you run into a northern fairy with a good memory, you'll get beaten to a pulp!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Oh, I see. Since I only have the records left behind by my predecessor, seems like you know more than me.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Hey, Habetrot.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The Northern Fairies were the first ones in Britain to coexist with humans. Like that time during the Summer War.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
But their descendant, Knocknarea, hates humans. What gives?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's what I was wondering too.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you know why, Habetrot?
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
Oh, you don't know about that? Guess I'll have to tell you then!
 
**Habetrot:**
About 4,000 years ago, in the year 2000 of the Fairy Calendar, the Summer War took place.
 
**Habetrot:**
Queen Mab invaded Britain from the western island and the clans were driven to the brink of annihilation.
 
**Habetrot:**
Tonelico intervened and convinced Mab to make peace with the clans.
 
**Habetrot:**
Mab was recognized as the King's Clan, or so the story goes. But the truth is a little different.
 
**Habetrot:**
In the first place, Mab was all but guaranteed to win. And as such, she refused to make peace with the clans.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah, well. I also thought that was way too convenient for those clans but, don't tell me...
 
**Habetrot:**
That's right. Mab narrowly lost at the very end. Her husband and right-hand man, a human warrior, betrayed her.
 
**Habetrot:**
And Tonelico did not miss that opportunity!
 
**Habetrot:**
Tonelico cornered Mab while she was still reeling and beat the snot out of her!
 
**Habetrot:**
And with that, she was made to join the clans and swear to never raise her hand against Britain again!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Kicking someone while they're down, huh...? Well, it's as valid a strategy as any though...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Brr...then I can see why she'd hate humans... or rather, wouldn't she want to wipe them out?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
If she wanted to wipe humans out altogether, Edinburgh couldn't have been built.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Shouldn't the real crux of the matter at hand be why she was reeling in the first place?

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**--ARROW--:**
 

 ~Fujimaru's room at night~
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Who is it?) Come in.|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Excuse me, Senpai! It's Mash Kyrielight, I'm back!
 
**Mash:**
Since Artoria's chocolate making is a very fierce battle, I'll head back soon!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
R-right.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A fierce battle, huh... (I can only guess)
 

---

 
**Mash:**
In line with this, I'd like you to answer this survey!
 
**Mash:**
Frankly, what do you think is the supreme shape for chocolate?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...There's a lot to choose from...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Considering my first experience with Artoria's technique...)
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe just a standard one?|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I agree! Yes, that's very helpful...
 
**Mash:**
Then I will return to the battlefield! Good night, Senpai!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Who is it?) Come in.|
 

---

 
**B：Fairy:**
Woooooo↓↓Hooooooooooooooooooooo↑↑！！
 
**B：Fairy:**
Don't be surprised, Human. I'm Aiken, Lady Knocknarea's faithful soldier.
 
**Aiken Drum:**
Lady Knocknarea has finished the 8th stage of the process and is currently taking a break.
 
**Aiken Drum:**
After the break, she will go to work through the night until the 19th stage...
 
**Aiken Drum:**
But during the break, she wants to talk to someone as a refresher.
 
**Aiken Drum:**
Yes, you, who's looking all around. You get it. Only you are in this room.
 
**Aiken Drum:**
Accept it and come with me. And don't try to escape through the window.
 
**Aiken Drum:**
Needless to say, Lady Knocknarea holds a position. This refreshment shall be kept in secret.
 
**Aiken Drum:**
There are no guards around, and I'll wait here too.
 
**Aiken Drum:**
Tosh! Lady Knocknarea, who's well-known for hating humans, is not as unreasonable as a Nightcall.
 
**Aiken Drum:**
Hold your breath, don't make noise, don't argue, and yet make interjections to show you're paying attention.
 
**Aiken Drum:**
With that&ndash; I wish you good night and good conversation!
 
**Knocknarea:**
You're here. I didn't think you'd come alone.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Are you enjoying Edinburgh at night?
 
**Knocknarea:**
It's not as good as Gloucester, but the main street should be worth seeing.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I stayed in my room and prepared for tomorrow.|
 
**Knocknarea:**
Even if it's none of your business? Can't you just have fun by yourself?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Yes. You're attentive to others' concerns. Hmm. A sense of solidarity that fairies lack. Hmm.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
When I came here, I had some fun.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Or rather, it wasn't necessary to ask. I can tell by the sparkle in your eyes.
 
**Knocknarea:**
On your way home, you'll stop by a boutique to look for a scarf of insect thread, then relax at a cafe, and treat yourself to some chocolate liquor.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As expected from my Edinburgh. A magical city that turns even the “foreign magus” into a tourist.
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
But I digress...
 
**Knocknarea:**
I invited you here for one reason only. To talk about the outside world...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Tell me, what is this 'pan-human History' that Morgan speaks of on her throne?
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm not interested in it at all, but I need to know as the Queen who controls the Northern Fairies.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Or are you too scared to speak without your friends?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Even if you're the foreign magus, you're still a frail person.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I don't think you can make such a decision to leak confidential information to the enemy&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, let's start with the story of Chaldea.|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Up 'till now, that's about it.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I talked for almost an hour ...)
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
Wait. You were so polite and smooth, and explained everything so clearly...
 
**Knocknarea:**
But I'm a little over my head, so stop here. Let me get things straight.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Chaldea, Heroic Spirits, Lostbelts, Pan-human History...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Okay...I've got it.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, it's useless to think about it now, right? It's a problem that we should take care of after defeating Morgan, right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Nod)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's right. We'll talk about this later.
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
I hope so. Thank you for your valuable information. I'm grateful as your Queen.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As a politician, fighting against political opponents is of course important, but the policy that comes afterwards is as well.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Outside Britain, there is not a “sea of nothingness”, but a wider world.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, I don't like the idea of fairies hiding in the woods and it basically being a human world...
 
**Knocknarea:**
But there will be plenty of ways to do this!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I can't tell you how encouraged I am that there is so much work to do!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Work...do you mean a war of aggression?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Work...do you mean the chocolate factory?
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
That's right. In a world with so many resources, why don't we make another “West Island”?
 
**Knocknarea:**
And the North American continent, you said? In addition, I will run up onto the entire island and give my regards.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Then we'll be enemies again, you and me. I'm looking forward to it.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(That will be a failure...I can't say it freely.)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Your personality doesn't change after all.)
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
Just now. You make that face sometimes.
 
**Knocknarea:**
You made strange remarks when you were in the chocolate field. Maybe about me too?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh wait. Don't say it, don't tell me!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I really want to hear a story of my other self, but I can't! If I hear it now, my skin will start to crawl!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Seems like it already is...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Crap... I really want to talk about it now...!)
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
...Huh. I managed to hold on...My queenly dignity was preserved...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, you're covered.|
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
We're covered! Now if we can just dispose of those who speak too much!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I said nothing.|
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
Very good. The ideal answer as a servant of the Queen.
 
**Knocknarea:**
But...I think I'll just ask this.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Assuming I were in your world as well. That “me”&mdash;what was the end of that me?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Was I betrayed by my lover...? Was I a ruthless queen until the end?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;I would say so.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good or bad, you struck a very good figure.
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
Yes...Hee&mdash;Hehe. Hehehehe!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Right! It's so obvious! There is no way for me to die from the pain of a broken heart!
 
**Knocknarea:**
So? What kind of hero was the one who defeated me? A tough fairy, right?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Ha? Cheese? Cheese...that cheese? Made from sheep's milk, that kind?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh, there is a cheese fairy over there. I wonder if they're kin to Aiken Drum.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Cheese was the weapon. It was a human who threw it.|
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
...!
 
**Knocknarea:**
In other words...I was killed by a human. Is that what happened?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Did you tell me such a silly story, knowing that I hate humans?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's not a silly story at all.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It’s a story about the last moments of a queen.
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;What's that?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Don't say it with such a serious face. I do not care for it.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, the cause of defeat of my predecessor Queen was also a human. So she tripped over a pebble and died under her own weight.
 
**Knocknarea:**
To think of it, maybe it's possible to be killed by a human. At least they won't put a weird curse on you.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The cause of the defeat of the predecessor queen...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe, that's...
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
Yeah. The pain of losing her lover made her unable to fight and wound up defeated by Tonelico.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Mab trusted humans too much. She loved them too much, thinking they were creatures just like her.
 
**Knocknarea:**
She ran through the battlefield with her beloved warrior who met her demands, but...
 
**Knocknarea:**
He died at the last moment.
 
**Knocknarea:**
When Mab turned back to share her joy after winning the decisive battle against the clans,
 
**Knocknarea:**
her beloved warrior drew his last breath alongside Mab's victory.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Of course. Humans cannot keep up with fairies, let alone an A-Rei like Mab.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Their promise to stay together was not kept. That's what it means to be betrayed.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Mab lost the will to fight then and there.
 
**Knocknarea:**
She realized her foolishness in how much she loved the warrior.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, that wound was healed by the time of the Queen's Calendar, and she had regained the ambition to conquer Britain.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Mab built Edinburgh and retired, and for a long time no King's Clan were born.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The seat was vacant for about 1500 years. Then I was born.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm the second head of the King's Clan. I, the great fairy who inherited Mab's power and is worthy of being queen.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I hate humans because they're useless in battle.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I've learned from Mab's mistakes. I will defeat Morgan with just my clan.
 
**Knocknarea:**
So...Artoria's Round Table is just in the way. Quite the eyesore.
 
**Knocknarea:**
You should be prepared too. If I win in tomorrow's game, all humans will be my property.
 
**Knocknarea:**
You'll be working in a safe chocolate factory with full benefits until the day you die.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's all right. Artoria will win.|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Humans aren't that weak, Knocknarea.|
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, refreshment's over. I'd better get back to work.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Do enjoy yourself, Fujimaru. Tonight will be your last time spent free.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...It's been a long night...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have to sleep soon....
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Who is it...?) Come in...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I have a bad feeling about this...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Are they opening the door stealthily..?)
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
And then, the fairy king splendidly flew in from the window after drawing attention to the door.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon!?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Oops, don't yell. It's already a pretty late time of night.
 
**Oberon:**
And this time I'm playing ninja! Regarding the point raised, I want to get our stories straight!
 
**Oberon:**
Hmm? Why am I a ninja?
 
**Oberon:**
I got fed up with the drudgery of the Round Table Army and ran away...that's certainly true.
 
**Oberon:**
But that's not my true nature. The Fairy King doesn't stay in one place for a long time.
 
**Oberon:**
Well, the truth is, I snuck away because I was concerned about you guys.
 
**Oberon:**
Isn't it natural to worry about your friends' well-being?
 
**Oberon:**
I disturbed you for this reason. That's right.
 
**Oberon:**
Good evening, Fujimaru. And good work with the fourth bell.
 
**Oberon:**
It was heard even in Londinium. Thanks to that, the morale of the Round Table Army is at its peak.
 
**Oberon:**
Percival has arranged a meeting with the Fang Clan, who have fled to Oxford.
 
**Oberon:**
Gareth and the children are also making Londinium lively. A new plantation has been set up.
 
**Oberon:**
I'm a little worried that Spriggan is still planning something...
 
**Oberon:**
It can be said that the southern part of the island has been almost entirely pacified. The rest is up to you.
 
**Oberon:**
You came to meet with Knocknarea, didn't you? Rumors of tomorrow's Mab Match are the hot topic in town tonight.
 
**Oberon:**
If she'll follow the Child of Prophecy, the attack on Camelot will be secured.
 
**Oberon:**
Forming an alliance with Knocknarea, ringing the bell at Oxford,
 
**Oberon:**
and the attack on Camelot. All in about three days, I think.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But what about the sixth bell?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
I'm ashamed. I've been looking for it all this time, but ...
 
**Oberon:**
The Pilgrim's Bell is a way to be “recognized by the clans”.
 
**Oberon:**
There is no point in ringing the sixth and the final bell that corresponds to the Mirror Clan.
 
**Oberon:**
Because there is no Mirror Clan anymore. The fifth bell is enough.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's fine, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The bells...
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
What are you worried about...?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Every time she rings one, Artoria torments herself with the thought...|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Really...well, I guess that's right.
 
**Oberon:**
Every time she rings the bell, Artoria grows stronger. At first, I thought it was about growing up, but...
 
**Oberon:**
That's not it. She isn't “growing up” so much as she's being “released”.
 
**Oberon:**
I think that the Fairies of Paradise are probably born with limitations on their abilities.
 
**Oberon:**
The Pilgrim's Bell may be a way to let loose those limitations.
 
**Oberon:**
At the same time, I think it evokes the knowledge—the memories and fate—that she originally had.
 
**Oberon:**
Every time Artoria rings the bell, she becomes aware of her “mission” and “own destiny.”
 
**Oberon:**
Now it's at four. It can be said that she is a different person from the one we met in the Nameless Forest.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A different person? In what way?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Her sense of duty has become stronger, and her priorities should have changed significantly.
 
**Oberon:**
I think her judgment as the Child of the Prophecy is stronger than her own personal values...
 
**Oberon:**
Oh, am I mistaken?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't know...I don't think it has changed.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Rather, she's getting more and more free, right?
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Is that so...well, it might be a good thing to be stubborn.
 
**Oberon:**
But I understand that you're worried. I know you didn't mention it to her so she wouldn't fuss about it.
 
**Oberon:**
...
 
**Oberon:**
Do you remember what I told you before?
 
**Oberon:**
“In this Lostbelt, we're just bystanders. Our role is to see things through.”
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course, I remember.|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
That's how it is. We can neither save Britain nor change Artoria's fate.
 
**Oberon:**
Once you have a countermeasure against the Alien God, your mission is to leave immediately.
 
**Oberon:**
But...
 
**Oberon:**
I respect your resolution and your will.
 
**Oberon:**
Not in regards to Chaldea. The path you've taken personally.
 
**Oberon:**
After defeating Morgan. Whether you wish to save Britain...or to help Artoria,
 
**Oberon:**
I will support you. For the sake of pan-human history, though, it would be an additional detour.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it all right for me to be selfish...?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Sure thing. In the end, the ones who can do big things are those who work hard “for themselves”, Chaldean.
 
**Oberon:**
I've come this far alone.  I know a little bit about that sort of thing.
 
**Oberon:**
What is it? Isn't it okay to indulge yourself for about 10% of what you've done?
 
？1,1040,saveMaterial：Thank you.....
？2,2040,saveMaterial：... (but, that's...)
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
But Artoria is a bit different. I don't want to spoil her.
 
**Oberon:**
She's got low self-esteem, but she hates to lose. It is a rather annoying personality trait.
 
**Oberon:**
If she doesn't push back with her sense of duty, she may run full speed in a strange direction.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon, you're harsh with Artoria.|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
And why not!? I don't know what I'm so worried about here. It's unexpected!
 
**Oberon:**
I can't tell you how many times I've had to pull strings behind her back! I wanted her to grow up as a graceful princess!
 
**Oberon:**
&mdash;Oh, no. My apologies. That was a matter of my taste.
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria, well, she's fine as she is, right? I never get tired of watching her. I feel excited.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I see now that Oberon likes Artoria.)|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Your lips are swollen. Let's end this conversation right here.
 
**Oberon:**
I mean, we've been talking too long!
 
**Oberon:**
If I don't return to Londinium by morning, they'll find out that I've snuck away! See ya!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
To you, isn't Artoria like Titania, your queen?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
My goodness, I don't know about that. True, I'm still searching for her.
 
**Oberon:**
It was the very edge of a story conveniently cut, even within one so convenient.
 
**Oberon:**
She was just a convenient stage device for the moment. No one thought about her happy ending.
 
**Oberon:**
Well, it's all right to play a minor role. If you need to think about it all the time, you will lose your grip on reality.
 
**Oberon:**
The reader is not required to have that much imagination, nor the playwright who wrote the script.
 
**Oberon:**
It's a fairy tale either way. Anything superfluous can be left out on the page. That is the way in which she was born.
 
**Oberon:**
So, it's all right. My queen really needn't exist.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Devil Caren:**
To everyone gathered here, we apologize for the long wait.
 
**Devil Caren:**
The Valentine Mab Match to determine the will, dignity, pride and determination as a fairy&mdash;
 
**Devil Caren:**
Starts here and now!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The cathedral is packed with spectators...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is a little different that what I thought.
 

---

 
**Devil Caren:**
From the Moon Kitchen, leader of the northern fairies, daughter of Queen Mab, Lady Knocknarea.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Wow, that's a load of chocolate in that wagon behind her! Some are as big as Mash's shield!
 
**Devil Caren:**
From the Star Kitchen, the Child of Prophecy now famous enough to reach Her Majesty, Lady Artoria.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Damn, is there chocolate in the wagon behind her? Does Mash's shield look like food?
 
**Devil Caren:**
Are the both of you prepared? The finishing touches will be made here in the cathedral.
 
**Devil Caren:**
You have one hour. Chocolate is poison, so give it a fiery finish!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's started.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do your best! You can do it, Star Kitchen!
 

---

 
**Devil Caren:**
Please pay attention to the Moon Kitchen and Lady Knocknarea.
 
**Devil Caren:**
No confusion or panic, yet she does not take her hands off the whip. You could say her flow is perfect.
 
**Devil Caren:**
When I visited her in the kitchen this morning,
 
**Devil Caren:**
“I am not creating a mere luxury product. It is a sublime piece of art that melts your heart,”
 
**Devil Caren:**
is what she boasted...
 
**Devil Caren:**
I see, it's taking shape! A shame the viewers on the second floor can't see.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We can't even see it on the first floor! Get a monitor, a monitor!
 
**Devil Caren:**
Unfortunately, only the arena seats allow the viewing of the players in live action. Please understand.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Next time, please buy your arena seats for 60,000 morpounds☆
 
**Red Rabbit:**
That is ten times the price of the second floor seats. How very conscientious of them.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Next, please look at the unparalleled collaboration between Lady Artoria and her assistant in the Star Kitchen.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Is that a cake? It seems to be. What painstakingly detailed, elaborate decoration!
 
**Devil Caren:**
The assistant releases magical energy like a storm! No, they're concentrating!
 
**Devil Caren:**
Crafting millimeter by millimeter in the middle of the rapids! If anything, this is crazy!
 
**Devil Caren:**
This is an unforeseen dark cheat, or a dark horse, you could say.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Lady Knocknarea was the overwhelming favorite before the match began, but at this stage the Star Kitchen's strategy means they are evenly matched&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Wow, it looks delicious! Great work, Mash!
 
**Artoria:**
All right! Now for a pinch of the secret ingredient!
 
**Devil Caren:**
Are you stupid!?
 
**Devil Caren:**
Ahem...
 
**Devil Caren:**
Please excuse me, and do appreciate the new methods of making chocolate.
 
**Habetrot:**
...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
...
 
**Da Vinci:**
...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Do we run while we still can...?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No. I don't really understand what just happened, but the match isn't decided yet.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
A Valentine is more about impact than taste, right? Then the possibility is still there, that it is.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are you talking like that?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Taste is still important though.
 

---

 
**Devil Caren:**
That's it! Preparations complete~☆
 
**Devil Caren:**
Both players please show us your creations. First is the Moon Kitchen, Lady Knocknarea's...
 
**Devil Caren:**
Majestic splendor, superior technique. Luxury upon luxury piled up into the highest form of craftsmanship.
 
**Devil Caren:**
A reproduction of Edinburgh Castle, created with 19 layers of special coating. How very appropriate for the queen.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Certainly a masterpiece created to destroy your rival in love. But in truth, isn't it a heavy thing to receive (in many ways)?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Hmph&ndash;While that may be true, you don't have to be so frank.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Aiken Drum did splendidly this time. It was a victory for my splendid assistant.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Thank you for your comments. Now for the Star Kitchen, Lady Artoria's...
 
**Devil Caren:**
And the only question that can be asked is: what is this? What an original chocolate.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh thank God, It's just a normal heart.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But still, against that castle chocolate...
 

---

 
**Red Rabbit:**
Im...possible...
 
**Habetrot:**
What...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Is...that...?
 
**The Audience:**
Woooooo...? Hoooooooooooo...???
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...? The venue...?|
 

---

 
**Devil Caren:**
Ladies and gentlemen, I understand how you all feel. I share the same feeling.
 
**Devil Caren:**
But! As master of ceremonies and the judge, I must have the courage to say it before anyone else!
 
**Devil Caren:**
It's smooth, plump, slimy, and yet despite all that you can't help but feel like it has body heat!
 
**Devil Caren:**
Nice Valentine! It's the birth of an entirely new design of chocolate!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The heck?
 
**The Audience:**
WoHoHooooooooooo!
 
**The Audience:**
It's filled with blood and bursting with power! The power of this heart is on another level!
 
**Devil Caren:**
It's all I can do to listen to your comments. Lady Artoria, why this chocolate?
 
**Devil Caren:**
What about that wonderful cake that your assistant Mash was making?
 
**Devil Caren:**
This shape is the very symbol of the creed handed down by the northern fairies; “Prove yourself as the strongest.”
 
**Devil Caren:**
However did you come up with the idea of using it for a chocolate? Are you a genius?
 
**Artoria:**
Ahaha, it's nothing like that. I just learned it from Mash.
 
**Artoria:**
Uh, well...it's a heart shape.
 
**Artoria:**
It's simple, so it was easy to make! That way, I think it's easy to put your feelings into it!
 
**Devil Caren:**
Easy to put your feelings into it...what wise words.
 
**Devil Caren:**
I may be a chocolate fairy, but I forgot the most important thing of all...
 
**Devil Caren:**
Yes, it isn't the cost or brand of ingredients that matters! It's love!
 
**Devil Caren:**
As chocolates go, Lady Knocknarea's is by far the more delicious,
 
**Devil Caren:**
but in terms of passion, Lady Artoria is the clear victor.
 
**Devil Caren:**
In the future, I will be sure to give you due respect.
 
**Devil Caren:**
Therefore victory goes to&ndash;Lady Artoria, of the Star Kitchen!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Heh&ndash;Well done, Artoria. You've finally found your strong point. (Making a pleased master's face in the background)
 
**Knocknarea:**
I give up... So that was your ace in the hole, huh? You mind if I buy that idea from you?
 
**Mash:**
We did it, Artoria!
 
**Artoria:**
Thanks to you, Mash! It was worth going through 212 prototypes!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Does this mean...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's no such thing as a heart shape in the fairy kingdom...?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Looks like it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Or maybe they just didn't connect it with the “heart.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
Because of the shape of Knocknarea's magical energy... get it?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aah...you can't see your own aura...|
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I don't really get it. The castle one is stronger. It's like a great story!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, this time is just special! Or something.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Knocknarea will adopt the heart design for her own castle&mdash;hm?
 
**Knocknarea:**
...? Artoria, your chocolate is thumping somehow. What did you put in it, exactly?
 
**Knocknarea:**
It's not going to explode, is it? I just want to make sure.
 
**Mash:**
I don't think even Artoria would mix up sugar and gunpowder...
 
**Artoria:**
Of course I didn't. I did a proper taste test and only put in what was delicious.
 
**Artoria:**
All of it.
 
**Knocknarea:**
All of it...meaning what, exactly? Again, I just want to make sure.
 
**Artoria:**
The ingredients here. All of them.
 
**Artoria:**
It would be a waste to not use them after they were all prepared, right?
 
**Devil Caren:**
Yes, I was watching. While Mash was cleaning up the kettle,
 
**Devil Caren:**
Lady Artoria did something strange to the ingredients and stuffed them all into the chocolate.
 
**Devil Caren:**
As a result, a huge amount of magical energy was poured into the chocolate, the ingredients all fused together, and it's come alive.
 
**Devil Caren:**
And thus, the Calamity that would destroy the world was born. Gulp.
 
**The Audience:**
It's the Child of Prophecy's superweapoooon! Run awaaaaaay!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Aah, the cathedral is ruined! It's turning my fairies to chocolate one by one!
 
**Knocknarea:**
What did you think you were doing! You can't just mix everything together!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Are you the type who thinks ten minutes on low is the same thing as two minutes on high!?
 
**Artoria:**
(nodding in acknowledgement)  
 
**Mash:**
Master, we have an emergency! We have to protect Artoria's honor...
 
**Mash:**
No, we have to fight to destroy the evidence! That chocolate is something that should not exist!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's sad, but we have no choice.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well said, Mash.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Be gentle! Kill it softly! That way it'll still taste goooood!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**That Which Should Never Have Been Made:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Look out, Knocknarea&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No matter how strong you are, that instant-death bullet...!
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
Huh? Seriously?
 
**Artoria:**
Knocknarea!
 
**Narration:**
It was five years ago in Gloucester.
 
**Narration:**
Several days after that awful experience at the fairy ball.
 
**Artoria:**
You're Knocknarea, from the King's Clan! I've never seen one of your kind before!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Yeah, well...we haven't really moved into the south yet.
 
**Knocknarea:**
But just you watch, eventually we'll be living in every major city down here.
 
**Knocknarea:**
That's my destiny. The cherished desire of the northern fairies I inherited from the previous queen.
 
**Artoria:**
Carrying on the will of your predecessor...
 
**Artoria:**
But aren't you the only one of the King's Clan, Knocknarea?
 
**Artoria:**
The northern fairies may move down here, but the clan itself won't multiply...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh yes, they will. Anybody I bestow my blood to becomes one of the King's Clan.
 
**Artoria:**
Huh? Uh, is that some kind of psychological thing? Like the bully and the bullied?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Why do you have to make it sound so seedy? Can't you say “ruler and subjects” or “queen bee and drones”?
 
**Knocknarea:**
As far back as anyone can remember, the King's Clan has stood alone.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Mab was born among the corpses of many fairies. The ones who lost their lives during the Spring War...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Their bodies became the lands of Britain, but they refused to be born again as the next generation.
 
**Knocknarea:**
No, because there was no land where they would be reborn, they would be born, die, and be born again...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Rather than go through that over and over, they decided to use up all their lives to give birth to a new ruler.
 
**Knocknarea:**
That was the great fairy Mab. She was like Queen Morgan for the northern fairies.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Alone, Mab was “all of the northern fairies.”  Her Rule was to “dominate and prosper.”
 
**Knocknarea:**
She was a fairy who would share her power with anyone who would swear allegiance to her.
 
**Knocknarea:**
She gifted power to those who wished for it, and constructed a sphere of influence known as the “Western Island.”
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, as compensation, when it was complete her power weakened considerably...
 
**Knocknarea:**
She never knew what would take advantage of that.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Eventually the weakened Mab took on guards, and because of that, she came to take a spouse who pledged their love to her.
 
**Artoria:**
She got hitched!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh it was sooooo, sooooooo lovey-dovey! As though it became spring!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Ah, no good. Not in spring, not in spring. You can only do that in fall or winter.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Anyway, the King's Clan divides power among those who swear allegiance to it.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Any fairy I grant my blood to becomes a member until their loyalty is broken.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I, the queen bee, receive devotion in the form of labor, and the vassals gain my power.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The more assemble under me in the north, the more the King's Clan will grow.
 
**Artoria:**
Sharing your power...does it ever return to you?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well...that's the problem. It's not like I'm lending it out.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The power given will not return. The more of the clan there are, the more the queen bee deteriorates...
 
**Knocknarea:**
It's kind of self-destructive, don't you think? Though Mab wasn't that thoughtless.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If she expanded her territory over all of Britain, there would be only one rule.
 
**Knocknarea:**
“As long as the vassals are of the King's Clan, the power of the clan as a whole becomes the power of the queen.”
 
**Knocknarea:**
The queen becomes poor by distributing wealth among the masses, but she doesn't actually lose anything because the country itself belongs to her.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Mab took national power over her own personal power. I wholeheartedly agree with that policy.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Personal values don't develop a country.
 
**Knocknarea:**
A country becomes affluent and beautiful through lots of hard work and talent.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Like here in Gloucester...though it's a bit twisted here.
 
**Knocknarea:**
My mission is to unify Britain and to sit on the throne in Camelot.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Would have been nice and easy if Her Majesty had taken me as her heir, but there's Tristan, you know?
 
**Knocknarea:**
So long as that weird brat is still around, there's no choice but force, is there?
 
**Narration:**
“Wanna go out for a bit?” she asked in an absurd tone like it was no big deal.
 
**Narration:**
At that time, she was a splendid queen.
 
**Narration:**
She said it was her queen's last wish, but was acting on her own desire to be queen.
 
**Narration:**
Greedy, selfish, and unashamed to talk about her dreams in front of anybody...
 
**Narration:**
The hardest-working fairy in Britain. That's how Knocknarea was.
 
**Artoria:**
T-that's an amazing goal to have...but is it okay to tell that to someone like me?
 
**Artoria:**
I mean, that's rebelling against Her Majesty, isn't it?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh, you gonna snitch? Well, can you even do that in the first place?
 
**Knocknarea:**
“With a body like that, everyone in her clan should die!”  or something like that.
 
**Artoria:**
I-I see. I don't know if I'm giving off that energy, but...
 
**Knocknarea:**
You are. I know I generally do too, but you're really giving off that vibe.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Basically, you seem to view “you” and “other fairies” as two fundamentally different things.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Like your whole existence is irregular. As if you're outside the social ranks of “upper” and “lower” that Her Majesty laid down.
 
**Knocknarea:**
You're just...off. Like a completely different being of some kind.
 
**Knocknarea:**
To sum it up, you look down on all the fairies in Britain.
 
**Artoria:**
Hey, don't judge me, you idiot! I'm the one being looked down on!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Yeah, that's right. You need that energy.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Your style of listening is fine, but too much of it will kill your heart. Just like me.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Knocknarea, are you dead? With your brazen attitude?
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, it's the other way around. You're dead because you're brazen! Darlington's zombie scandal!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Now-what-are-you-talking-about?
 
**Artoria:**
Awawa, ow, ow! That's too violent!
 
**Knocknarea:**
That's just a fable...I mean, that was a long time ago!
 
**Knocknarea:**
You were apologizing to that fairy accompanying you in the hall. The head of your village? Well I guess it's none of my concern.
 
**Knocknarea:**
“I'm sorry for my weakness. I'll do better, I swear.”
 
**Knocknarea:**
That was disgusting. Never do that again, at least not in front of me.
 
**Knocknarea:**
What's wrong with being weak? Who's going to lose because you can't do it?
 
**Knocknarea:**
It's not others that are frustrated by your weakness, it's you. Others won't try harder next time, you will.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It's only natural to feel sorry for your mistakes, screwups, blunders, or overeating,
 
**Knocknarea:**
but don't apologize just for being weak in itself. Nothing is more wasteful.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Just so you know. I'm not saying this out of pity.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm angry because apologizing to others for your own weakness solves nothing.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If you have that kind of power, hold your head high. Do more things for yourself.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Your persistence is like a volcano, huh? You're like a cat that beats up dragons.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Don't worry about what happens around you, just focus on your dreams.
 
**Knocknarea:**
After all, there are those in this world who can't even do that.
 
**Narration:**
That brief comment surprised me.
 
**Narration:**
Despite being born into wealth of power, or maybe because of it,
 
**Narration:**
she innately understood just how lucky someone was to have what they did.
 
**Artoria:**
Huh...Easy to say when you think it's someone else's problem.
 
**Artoria:**
All right then, my turn. What's your dream, Knocknarea? I'm sure you achieved it a long time ago.
 
**Knocknarea:**
My dream? Isn't it obvious?
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;It's love!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm going to find someone who moves my very soul, and we're going to fall in love so hard the rest of the country will follow us!
 
**Artoria:**
Are you crazy?
 
**Artoria:**
I mean, that's not a dream. Don't you already have a lover?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, that's the problem. I actually don't.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Did you just laugh at me!? You did, didn't you!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, don't get the wrong idea. I'm actually very popular. I have tons of suitors back in Edinburgh.
 
**Artoria:**
S-sure you do. You are really attractive, Knocknarea. So, why then?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Hmm...I guess it's more of a vow, or a way to distance myself from Mab.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If you hold back too much on the things you want most, it reeeeeally builds up in your stomach, you know?
 
**Knocknarea:**
And then I'll use that frustration to take the throne. I won't fall in love until I rule Britain!
 
**Narration:**
I couldn't help but burst out laughing at how ridiculous her wish was.
 
**Narration:**
Because her objective and her dream were the complete opposite. And she didn't even realize it.
 
**Narration:**
She didn't want to be a queen and fall in love,
 
**Narration:**
she was rushing to do what her predecessor forced on her so she could hurry up and fall in love!
 
**Knocknarea:**
What? Then what's your dream? Is it that much better than mine?
 
**Artoria:**
Hmm. I guess it's more or less the same.
 
**Artoria:**
I want to walk down the streets as a noble fairy. As grand and as cool as you, Knocknarea.
 
**Artoria:**
It must really feel good.
 
**Narration:**
If she was my rival, then fine, I thought.
 
**Narration:**
Up until now I'd had very little, but it seems like I had been blessed with competition.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Idiot. There's nothing grand about it, it's just fashion.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I guess I could help you&mdash;but then it wouldn't be your dream, would it?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Maybe after we both get rid of our baggage. You want to race and see who makes it first?
 
**Narration:**
I saw the same sky as her that night. With a friend who spoke of her dreams, who I had to respect.
 
**Artoria:**
Bah!? What was that awful memory I sealed away!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh thank God, she's woken up!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Looks like it was just a temporary concussion.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...? What's wrong, everyone? You all look so serious. Did something happen...
 
**Artoria:**
...right, I remember. I took a direct hit from the chocolate attack...
 
**Artoria:**
Damn you, devil chocolate! How dare you raise a hand against your creator! I'll smash you into small pieces, then everyone can enjoy you!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I guess you really did just pass out. You seem like you stayed up all night. Did you have a good dream?
 
**Artoria:**
I did not, and I did not stay up at all. I slept well last night. Didn't you concede!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Yeah, yeah. I gave up. You won the Mab Match.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The spectators all ran away, but the judge called it.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As promised, I relinquish the right of command to the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'll be serving under you, so show me what you're capable of.
 
**Artoria:**
...? Are you okay, Knocknarea? You eat something weird?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's talking about your alliance.|
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, that's right!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, you did try to feed her something weird.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Fujimaru...don't you think you give Artoria a little too much slack?
 
**Knocknarea:**
You're not letting her eat in the middle of the night, are you? She'll only get dumber.
 
**Artoria:**
Hey! What's wrong with a midnight snack!?
 
**Mash:**
Artoria. We were talking about the alliance with Knocknarea...
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;! That's right!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Are you sure about this...?
 
**Artoria:**
After this whole mess, I can't exactly say I've won...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Good, you're aware of the disaster you caused. I'm relieved you're able to make such composed judgements.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well, it's obvious I'll win next time. But we can't exactly waste more time on this.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm sure by last night, the Queen learned that you came here.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If we were to join forces, Camelot would just recall all the soldiers they have scattered throughout Britain.
 
**Knocknarea:**
We need to strike before that happens. Are you ready, Artoria?
 
**Knocknarea:**
You hurry back down south, ring Oxford's bell,
 
**Knocknarea:**
pick up the rest of the Round Table Army, and come back to my forward camp.
 
**Knocknarea:**
By then, I'll have advanced up to Camelot's main gate.
 
**Artoria:**
But Knocknarea, you said you wouldn't work with the Round Table...
 
**Knocknarea:**
It'd be a pain if you died in front of me. Humans can't be vassals of mine, so they can't take responsibility.
 
**Knocknarea:**
But I can admit that human knights like Percival are effective against the Queen's.
 
**Knocknarea:**
We can't exactly handle Mors-poisoned weapons like they can.
 
**Knocknarea:**
So yeah, I'll tolerate them a little. Seems like humans aren't that fragile.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Isn't that so, Fujimaru?
 
**Artoria:**
When did you two get so close? Were you up all night practicing making chocolate?
 
**Artoria:**
By the way, do you remember our night in Gloucester?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Of course I do. What do you take me for!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Anyway. In the name of Knocknarea, the northern fairies will fight alongside the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Now, please leave quickly. You don't have a day to lose.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;I know. I'm the one who rang the bell in Orkney, after all.
 
**Artoria:**
Fujimaru. Mash. Da Vinci.
 
**Artoria:**
Muramasa. Habenyan. Rab-bit. Grimm.
 
**Artoria:**
We're hurrying to Oxford. Pack your bags.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Nope. If that's the case, I'm staying here. You'll need a liaison with the north, won't you?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
And it doesn't look like there are any mages here. I'll teach you a bit about how to counter Morgan's spells.
 
**Knocknarea:**
You? Well, if it's to our advantage then I don't mind.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Just leave it to me. I'll use this time to carve runes on all your soldier's shields.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Morgan's magecraft is nothing to sneeze at, so I'll make sure they can take at least one blow.
 
**Knocknarea:**
So you're some kind of mage strategist, huh? Not too bad, this makes me feel like a real queen now!
 
**Knocknarea:**
See you soon, Artoria and Fujimaru.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I wanted to show you around Edinburgh, but we'll do that another day.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Next time I see you will be on the battlefield. We'll both be at our best for the final battle!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
Wheeew! A lot happened, but there's a heap of good news!
 
**Artoria:**
I can proudly inform Percival...
 
**Artoria:**
that Knocknarea is finally listening to us!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep! Now, onto Oxford!|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You're in high spirits, just like a city girl. Was your duel with Knocknarea that fun?
 
**Artoria:**
Ehh...yeah, I suppose. I didn't have any dreams...haha... probably because I pulled an all-nighter.
 
**Artoria:**
But...yes, looking back at it, I had a lot of fun.
 
**Artoria:**
Not just Edinburgh, but our journey so far was loads of fun.
 
**Artoria:**
It's almost a shame that...it's going to end after we defeat Queen Morgan.
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
Oh...that's right, Tonelico and I look identical, right?
 
**Artoria:**
If I say stuff like this, Mash won't know what sort of face to make.
 
**Artoria:**
I'm sorry if I made you feel awkward, but...
 
**Artoria:**
I'm glad you're mourning her like that. Makes me think that both Tonelico and I are blessed with good friends.
 
**Mash:**
No...I'm the one blessed with good company.
 
**Mash:**
Tonelico, Mister Black Knight, the slightly scary Wryneck, and&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
...and&mdash;umm, I feel like there was...someone else who always stood by my side&mdash;
 
**Habetrot:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What happened!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Red Rab-bit!?
 

---

 
**Red Rabbit:**
Enemy attack, it's an enemy attack! It appears we have been ambushed!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
We are surrounded! Everyone, please step out and return fire. Please protect the carriage.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Damn it, to think the Queen's army would be here even though we're still in Knocknarea's territory!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Let's do this Fujimaru, Da Vinci, Mash!
 
**???:**
A&mdash;aa, a&mdash;iiiiiyaaaaaaaaa…………
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wh&mdash;what's that...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could it be...a human...?
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...Tsk, sorry about getting you all fired up. But stay back, Fujimaru.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That's not something you should be near. Da Vinci, Habetrot...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We'll handle this, alright?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes, I agree.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru, Mash, stay back. That's probably&mdash;
 
**???:**
aaa……aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Master, this way! Let's get away from the carriage for now!
 
**Mash:**
That enemy is...most likely...a living human afflicted by the Mors curse!
 
**Artoria:**
(A human afflicted by the Mors curse...? That's unnatural&mdash;)
 
**Artoria:**
Watch out!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Hahaha...wow, amazing! She negated my magecraft again...!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Hey, how did you do it...? How did you know that was me?
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Even though I went through the trouble of scattering human trash everywhere...why are you just running to safety...?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fairy Knight Tristan...!|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Baobhan Sith...!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Don't you dare call me...! It's not my fault, it's not my fault...!
 
**Mash:**
You&mdash;! You're Fairy Knight Tristan...!
 

---

 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Yes, that's right! I am my mother's daughter! The only fairy in the kingdom who inherited mother's magecraft!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
That's why&mdash;
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
You'll die here, you bastards! I won't let the likes of you take my place!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Ahhh...I lost. I lost. I lost...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Poor, poor Baobhan Sith...everyone's darling Baobhan Sith...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Of course, she's the Child of Prophecy after all... she's not like me at all...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Not like me at all...not like me at all...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
There's no way I can win against her skills... that's why...that's why...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I'll be better off going for the human. You're doomed to be my toy.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
That's&mdash; Fujimaru!
 
**Mash:**
Senpai and Artoria...disappeared...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
He&ndash;Hehe, kehehehehehe! What's this, this is amaaaaazing!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
What a great bargain. The Child of Prophecy would've evaded it.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
So I thought I'd torment the human instead...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
To think she'd dive right into the trap, what a laughable idiot!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Well, they were both trash to begin with. They deserve to be in a trash heap!
 
**Mash:**
You were aiming for this...!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
What, avenging Boggart? You fool, as if I'd fight you!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
“Mirror, mirror, reflect my image”!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Hahahahahahahahahaha! Curse yourself for having nothing other than brute strength!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Now both the Child of Prophecy and the foreign magus are done for!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Britain belongs to mother! Oh, I wonder if she'll finally praise me this time!
 
**Mash:**
No, wait...! I said wait, Tristan! Tristaaaaaaan!
 
## Section 21: Lost Will 
 
**A：Low-level Fairies:**
Have you heard about the apartment on 6th Avenue? The fairies who lived there never came back.
 
**B：Low-level Fairies:**
Lady Tristan did it again...she never seems to take a break, that one.
 
**B：Low-level Fairies:**
“I can't stand your laughter.” “I can't stand your silence.”
 
**B：Low-level Fairies:**
She'll kill you no matter what you do. Why did Her Majesty bring back a fairy like that?
 
**A：Low-level Fairies:**
You can say that again. Camelot would be a utopia without her around.
 
**B：Low-level Fairies:**
Damn it...will someone, anyone, punish that lunatic...?
 
**B：Low-level Fairies:**
I envy Salisbury. Lady Aurora would've long since sent a fairy like that to the dungeons.
 
**Advanced Fairies:**
Fairy Knight Tristan? What a joke. Who even respects that little girl?
 
**Advanced Fairies:**
Going around saying she's the queen's daughter. How stupid. She's the only one who actually calls herself that.
 
**Advanced Fairies:**
Did Her Majesty ever once cast a kind word her way?
 
**Advanced Fairies:**
She's just some country bumpkin in an extravagant dress. She has neither culture nor grace.
 
**D：Advanced Fairies:**
Yes, truly so. I'm sick of hearing about the 'beloved daughter'.
 
**D：Advanced Fairies:**
The entire city of Cambridge disappearing is also Tristan's doing, no?
 
**D：Advanced Fairies:**
To leave such a poisonous moth go unchecked, Her Majesty is getting up there in age...
 
**D：Advanced Fairies:**
No, of course this is not my opinion. It's just the word on the street.
 
**D：Advanced Fairies:**
I just pray for Her Majesty to see the light. If only that girl weren't a Fairy Knight&mdash;
 
**Knight of the Queen:**
New Darlington's beyond saving. It's no longer a functioning city.
 
**Knight of the Queen:**
The fairies who tried to flee the city have all been sent to the underground dungeons, and only criminals come in to fill their place.
 
**Knight of the Queen:**
There are no more decent fairies there. Not to mention, every night, someone always dies at the Slaughter Theatre without fail.
 
**Queen's Guard:**
That ball game was the reason Preston joined the King's Clan, Knocknarea's faction, right?
 
**Queen's Guard:**
Saying something about gathering football teams from each city to hold a tournament......
 
**Queen's Guard:**
With immediate execution for the losing team, but even the winning team from Preston was...right?
 
**Knight of the Queen:**
My word...Such wantonness.
 
**Knight of the Queen:**
If only she were as skilled as Lord Lancelot or Lord Gawain, we may still have been able to tolerate her...
 
**Knight of the Queen:**
That little girl's magical energy is that of a lowly fairy. If she hadn't been gifted the name of Sir Tristan, she'd be third-rate at best.
 
**Knight of the Queen:**
No...she's still third-rate even with it. If it weren't for Her Majesty's blessings, she'd be inferior even to us royal knights.
 
**Knight of the Queen:**
Like they say, the weaker the dog, the louder it barks.
 
**Knight of the Queen:**
If she only stopped being Her Majesty's daughter, every fairy in Camelot would line up to kill that boisterous dog.
 
**Narration:**
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. They're the boisterous ones.
 
**Narration:**
I am the Queen's daughter, no matter what those small fry say.
 
**Narration:**
Because my mother taught me magecraft, clothed me, and gave me a name to bear.
 
**Narration:**
And she gave me New Darlington to tinker with, break, and play with to my heart's content.
 
**Narration:**
By that, she means 'kill any fairies that anger you,' right? By that, she means 'shatter any happiness that annoys you,' right?
 
**Morgan's Voice:**
Why?
 
**Narration:**
But it didn't work. Mother wouldn't praise me.
 
**Morgan's Voice:**
Why are you like this?
 
**Narration:**
Even though I'm trying so hard, I still don't know what mother wants from me.
 
**Morgan's Voice:**
Why are you always like this, Baobhan Sith!?
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Aaa, aaaaa, aaaaaaaaaa! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Lady Morgan!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I'll do better next time. I'll kill more next time.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I am whimsical, cruel, and cute. Britain's sweetheart. Everyone's darling, Baobhan Sith.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I will act in such a manner. I will conduct myself like the queen's heir.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for always ending up like this.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
But I am trying. Even though I don't understand, I am trying!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Oh, Mother, Mother&mdash;
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
My mother, kinder than anyone, who adopted someone like me&mdash;
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Huh...? This is...my room...on my bed...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Why...? Even though...I did it properly...this time......
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I trapped them in the Garden, entered the mirror, and then&mdash;
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I feel...heavy. What's wrong...with me? Need to get up...
 
**Beryl:**
Hey, hey, don't push yourself, Lady Spinel. You've got dark circles under your eyes, you know?
 
**Beryl:**
Have you not been sleeping well? Or have you been brought to your limit? I mean, you did filch a treasure from the throne.
 
**Beryl:**
Going behind Morgan's back is applaudable. Morgan is incensed, no thanks to that though...
 
**Beryl:**
I'll give you that! It's through troubling their parents that children grow!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Beryl...? I'm sorry, I'll get up now&mdash;what?
 
**Beryl:**
No need to get up. You need to stay in bed if you're feeling tired, right?
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
&mdash;Yes. But Beryl...that thud...just now. I heard something...fall.
 
**Beryl:**
Don't worry about it. It's just your body rotting and your fingertips falling off. It doesn't hurt, does it?
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
&mdash;But, why?
 
**Beryl:**
No idea. Isn't it because you used the Garden of Dejection? That's one hell of a curse, isn't it?
 
**Beryl:**
Oh, or perhaps&ndash;you finally fell out of favor with Morgan and her magical energy is wearing off?
 
**Beryl:**
Hm? In that case, it wouldn't do for you to have the Garden of Dejection. It'll get worse and worse for you.
 
**Beryl:**
Alright now, hand it over. I'll keep it somewhere safe.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I-is, that so? But Beryl...I need to...take care of it.
 
**Beryl:**
Don't sweat it, it'll be fine. I'll leave it in the crypt. That should be for the best.
 
**Beryl:**
You just rest here. Until you can get up by yourself, ok?
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Wait...hey, wait. Why...the crypt......?
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Beryl...where...are you?
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I can't move...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I can't move...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I wonder why...? I can't...move my arms...or legs... not one bit&mdash;
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
Deep down inside. I awoke to the sound of overlapping hearts chipping away at each other.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
I wonder...where is this? This isn't the moor we were just at.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
This is somewhere further away. This looks like the plane of 'nothingness' that exists between Britain on the surface and the inner sea of the planet.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
This is probably that Garden where Merlin is said to be confined in.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
But I heard there are several types of Gardens: “New Home”, “Horizon”, “Lost Will”, “Heavenly”.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
The properties of this Garden are probably&mdash;
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
I thought as much...this is Lost Will, the Garden of Dejection.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
A hell of self-harm that chips away at the heart of those that fall into it. A cold Garden that strips away all warm falsehoods.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
They say you can escape the Garden if you can endure until the very end...
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
But it's a vicious setup that will make you lose your mind before that comes to pass.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
Whatever...
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
If I can cut the line in the right place, my heart won't shatter.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
It means I won't be able to escape, but there's no way Baobhan Sith will be able to maintain the Garden with her magical energy.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
Either way, I should be out eventually. Until then, I will...
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
I will simply see that which I don't want to see.
 
**Fairies:**
Yes, the prophecy held true. That child is our star of hope.
 
**Fairies:**
We are saved now. We are forgiven now.
 
**Fairies:**
The savior, bearing the name Artoria, who drifted ashore.
 
**Fairies:**
We pray you grow strong and healthy until your sixteenth year. We pray the Queen’s soldiers do not find you.
 
**Fairies:**
&mdash;Now. Quick, quick, quick, quick.
 
**Fairies:**
You must turn sixteen as quickly as possible. We put all our faith in you.
 
**Fairies:**
That's why&mdash;
 
**Fairies:**
You must devote everything you have to us.
 
**Mother:**
Caster, I got you a new book today.
 
**Mother:**
A book on etiquette among the noble fairies. You'll be leaving for the castle at some point, after all.
 
**Mother:**
Let's start studying it right now. Hmm, is this table alright?
 
**Mother:**
The stable is quite cramped, but bear with it.
 
**Mother:**
&mdash;Incidentally, has your Fairy Pattern matured yet? You'll turn 16 in two years, you know.
 
**Mother:**
For now...I'm just a little worried for you. You have a very trying journey ahead.
 
**Village Leader:**
Caster, you did a splendid job today. You're truly a diligent, sincere, and efficient one.
 
**Village Leader:**
You always manage to find what the village lacks, never losing yourself in games.
 
**Village Leader:**
I wish the other fairies would follow your example. Looking after you has been a big help for us.
 
**Village Leader:**
And yet...this year's tax collection will be tough.
 
**Village Leader:**
Most of the ornaments you were wearing, and the treasure on the boat, have already been sold...
 
**Village Leader:**
The fairies in the village are beginning to think you may be a fraud.
 
**Village Leader:**
Oh, I worry so, so much...We're not going to make it through the winter like this.
 
**Village Leader:**
Why must you be so&mdash;weak and undependable?
 
**Friend:**
None of them have a bit of subtlety. Better not to live to old age if it means being so frail.
 
**Friend:**
Don't you agree, Caster? You gotta distance yourself from the stuff you don't like.
 
**Friend:**
Or is being treated special as the Child of Prophecy what you want?
 
**Friend:**
I'll treat you right. A slave is a slave, right? Even if you're the Child of Prophecy, I won't give you special treatment.
 
**Friend:**
By the way, have you been growing? If you don't give something back, we'll have nothing left.
 
**Friend:**
There's nothing left to sell. At this rate, you're going to get sold to Her Majesty, you know?
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
The Child of Prophecy, the Child of Prophecy. The Child of Prophecy, raised in a stable.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
The Child of Prophecy, who was the village's slave.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
Even when they made you do something you didn't want to do, Child of Prophecy, you would simply smile and tell them to leave it to you.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
After all, you'll be killed if you rebel, and refusing is just tiresome.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
In that case, it's far easier to just shut up and go with the flow. I thought I was fine with that.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
If I just kept my head down and turned sixteen...
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
No matter how impossible the task, I would be able to leave that village behind.
 
**Fairies:**
Show us proof, show us proof.
 
**Fairies:**
Show us proof that you are the Child of Prophecy. That blacksmith living on the hill is one of the ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■   ■ ■ ■ ■ ■   ■ ■ ■ ■ ■.
 
**Fairies:**
You're the only one that blacksmith isn't wary of. The only one he opens up to.
 
**Fairies:**
If you are the fairy that will save Britain, then go k-■ ■ ■ that blacksmith.
 
**Fairies:**
Please. Please. Every day is nerve-wracking.
 
**Fairies:**
That's why&mdash;you must protect us by taking care of him...!
 
**Child of Prophecy:**
Yes&mdash;
 
**Child of Prophecy:**
Yes, yes&mdash;
 
**Ector:**
...
 
**Child of Prophecy:**
&mdash;Yes.
 
**Narration:**
I can't.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
No more. Isn't this enough already? Cut the line and shut out the path to the exit.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
Thus, the Child of Prophecy left Tintagel behind. My speciality is bouncing back even if I get down.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
A lot of things happened after that. Nothing of note though. Until I entered the Nameless Forest.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
There, I met Fujimaru.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
The person who, right now, in front of my very eyes, is on the brink of collapsing from the pitfall of dejection.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
For a moment there, I thought I saw Artoria behind that wall.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
But that can't be right. After all, that's a wall.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
There's no way I can see through walls, so the fact that I could see her at all is strange.
 
**Da Vinci:**
What are you looking at, Fujimaru? Are you so tired you're hallucinating?
 
**Da Vinci:**
It'd be bad if you're in that condition, since we're about to go take down a Lostbelt.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Replacements are a dime a dozen, but you're humanity's last Master.
 
**Fujimaru:**
Eh...you can find a replacement? Did you find another Rayshift-compatible candidate?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm, did you not know? You don't need Rayshifting to take down a Lostbelt.
 
**Da Vinci:**
As for the Master candidate, we have Kadoc now. Once his treatment is over, you won't be alone anymore.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But Master candidate isn't exactly the right word. Since originally, you were meant to be a plain candidate.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm? It's a broadcast. Hello?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Kadoc woke up? He's in good health? That's great! Contact the control room as soon as possible.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Good news, Fujimaru! Kadoc has recovered!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Now you can go back to being a spare! Navigation's also going to be easier for us!
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
I see.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
Even though you raised me up that much, it's this easy for you to say 'that's enough'.
 
**Meunière:**
Hey, Fujimaru. Where are you off to?
 
**Meunière:**
Come on...how long are you going to keep acting like a Master?
 
**Meunière:**
You're supposed to be on standby in your room, right? You'll get scolded if you keep walking around like that.
 
**Fujimaru:**
But I need to train my body, just in case. I don't know when we'll be headed for the Lostbelt.
 
**Meunière:**
Huh? There's no need for that at all! Both your training and your mission are a thing of the past.
 
**Meunière:**
You're just a civilian with no accomplishments. You don't need to force yourself to work hard anymore.
 
**Meunière:**
Leave that stuff to us and go relax in your room.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
Relax...what exactly does it mean to relax?
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
Someone dying in front of me, a body torn to pieces in front of me...
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
Training those legs that are desperate to flee, training to clear my mind...
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
(Even though I was made to do all that) I can't even recall any other way of life now, you know?
 
**Fujimaru:**
I don't get it...Am I really fine with this?
 
**Holmes:**
{(M)Mister/(F)Miss} Fujimaru, you are scared of understanding the current situation, of analyzing the world, are you not?
 
**Holmes:**
I understand. To tell the truth, it's always been on my mind too.
 
**Holmes:**
Whether it's 'truly alright to solve this case'.
 
**Holmes:**
Isn't that so?
 
**Holmes:**
Even if you avoid a bad end, it won't necessarily bring back what was lost.
 
**Holmes:**
What awaits you after the resolution of the case is a despairing view of the planet that has lost everything.
 
**Holmes:**
Compared to that, the current situation which still leaves room for a hopeful reading, may be a better sphere of existence.
 
**Holmes:**
We can't see the future, but if we work at clearing one obstacle after another, there is still the possibility that we may be rewarded&mdash;
 
**Holmes:**
See? Doesn't that make you feel better?
 
**Holmes:**
As long as there is no way to recover what was lost, you need not dwell on it.
 
**Holmes:**
Rest assured, no one blames you. After all&mdash;
 
**Holmes:**
The humanity who would've blamed you, the people who knew you, have all disappeared long ago.
 
**Artoria:**
I wonder if I should stop it now...Fujimaru can't cut the line.
 
**Artoria:**
Or rather, I can't watch this. Even if it's someone else's dejection.
 
**Artoria:**
Fujimaru's eyes are slowly losing focus.
 
**Artoria:**
And {(M)he/(F)she}'s grasping at {(M)his/(F)her} chest, almost like {(M)he/(F)she}'s suffocating in a vacuum.
 
**Gordolf:**
Are you listening, Fujimaru? There is no need to feel sympathy for them.
 
**Gordolf:**
They are but a what-if of human history. A history that has been unanimously discarded.
 
**Gordolf:**
I do understand why they'd act hostile towards us. From a logical standpoint.
 
**Gordolf:**
But that's the extent of it. At the end of the day, they are the losers.
 
**Gordolf:**
A celestial collision that caused an ice age? A world scorched by Ragnarok?
 
**Gordolf:**
Yes, it's heartbreaking. But it has nothing to do with us.
 
**Gordolf:**
Don't go around listening to what the inhabitants of the Lostbelts have to say. In terms of heartbreak, we are far worse off than they are.
 
**Gordolf:**
We are the winners from Pan-human History, the proper route. We cannot afford to fail...we cannot...
 
**Gordolf:**
But what can twelve people even do...? Restoration and prosperity have long since gone out the window!
 
**Gordolf:**
You know how doomed we are! Do they understand this loneliness, this pressure!?
 
**Gordolf:**
They are the ones who should concede! They are the ones who will disappear!
 
**Gordolf:**
Their suffering pales in comparison to ours!
 
**Fujimaru:**
&mdash;
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
In the end, it's just an imposition of negatives. After all, what's best for you is what's best for the world.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
That's right.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
They kept telling me it's for the present, that it's for the sake of getting a normal life back.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
That's how I got this far, but the truth is...
 
**Oberon:**
Yes. You are a peculiar one.
 
**Oberon:**
You've had many brushes with death, and fortune saved you each time.
 
**Oberon:**
You've abandoned the world many times, and misfortune saved you each time.
 
**Oberon:**
You have forsaken many lives. You have killed many worlds.
 
**Oberon:**
To think you're still doing fine even after all that?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Stop it.|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Or perhaps you're putting up with it 'just for the time being'?
 
**Oberon:**
“It's not my fault that I'm forced to fight. It's not my fault that I couldn't save anyone.”
 
**Oberon:**
This is no time to be complaining. Just cover that tear-stained face of yours with your hands.
 
**Oberon:**
“It's alright. Once the Human Order returns, I can go back to how I used to be.”
 
**Oberon:**
But while the human heart may be malleable, it can't go back to how it once was.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Stop it.|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
You'll go back to your normal life after the fighting ends? Could something that convenient even happen?
 
**Oberon:**
Your heart isn't going anywhere.
 
**Oberon:**
Those sceneries burned into your memories won't fade. The smells that you're steeped in won't wash off.
 
**Oberon:**
There is no way back.
 
**Oberon:**
But you're still trying to convince yourself otherwise, aren't you?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;I'm begging you, please stop.|
 

---

 
**Narration:**
See, you're already at your limit. I've noticed it for some time now.
 
**Oberon:**
That's the beauty of pan-human history. Everyone is equal, and no one is special.
 
**Oberon:**
There's no “eternity” or “change” the same way there is for fairies, so the outside world is constantly changing.
 
**J：Artoria:**
Woah&mdash;I see. It really is a very human land, isn't it?
 
**Narration:**
In that moment, what I thought was the exact opposite.
 
**Narration:**
“So it's full of liars. How disgusting.”
 
**Narration:**
Sugarcoating it with words like 'everyone is equal, no one is special'. How repulsive.
 
**Narration:**
As long as there is life, hierarchies will exist. As long as hierarchies exist, greatness will come about.
 
**Narration:**
But Oberon said that in pan-human history, such things can be solved through dialogue.
 
**Narration:**
Everyone is given a chance, yet no one is allowed to succeed.
 
**Narration:**
Jealousy, prejudice, wrath, fear...They're all dragging each other down.
 
**Narration:**
They're all deceiving each other so that none of them can rise from the dirt.
 
**Narration:**
That is pan-human History, Oberon said paradoxically.
 
**Narration:**
That's why I asked. Are you fine with that?
 
**Narration:**
Working for the sake of such a world, living in it. What do you yourself think of that?
 
**Fujimaru:**
I think I'll like it as much as anyone else...
 
**Fujimaru:**
I think it makes me just a little anxious...
 
**Narration:**
It was all too much, and so I hid behind a bitter smile.
 
**Narration:**
Really. Why are you acting tough even though you've been so thoroughly beaten down?
 
**Narration:**
{(M)His/(F)Her} body is on the verge of collapse, on the brink of falling apart.
 
**Narration:**
I know it's none of my business, but I need to stop the replay of Lost Will before that happens.
 
**Narration:**
Even though we're separated by a wall, I should at least be able to stop the magecraft from working&mdash;
 
**Fujimaru:**
&mdash;No. Even then, still.
 
**Artoria in the Garden of Dejection:**
What?
 
**Narration:**
What?
 
**Narration:**
Is it even possible to recover from that point...?
 
**Oberon:**
That's why you can just stop. You can let go now, Fujimaru.
 
**Oberon:**
Your actions, this Grand Order of Chaldea, are all just a bit too heavy a burden for you.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
His words were spoken out of concern for me.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
That's right. I always wanted someone to tell me that.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
That it's enough. That it's fine to leave everything unfinished.
 
**Doctor:**
Then, let's talk about a hypothetical situation.
 
**Doctor:**
From the standpoint of a species, the 'act of survival' is considered moral. But it's a little different for individuals.
 
**Doctor:**
The desire to continue and the desire to let it end. Continue or game over.
 
**Doctor:**
People are constantly in flux between these two. A game over isn't evil.
 
**Doctor:**
After all, everything ends eventually. To deny that is to deny life.
 
**Doctor:**
We have to be ready to accept it.
 
**Doctor:**
No matter how much you win, eventually it will all come to an end.
 
**Doctor:**
Hmm? That doesn't satisfy you? You're asking what you should be aiming for then?
 
**Doctor:**
Haha, sounds like you alright, Fujimaru. That's a good question.
 
**Doctor:**
That's an easy one. You don't want to stop the game, but finish the game instead.
 
**Doctor:**
The end comes for both you and me. Accomplish lots by then.
 
**Doctor:**
Whether it's joy or sadness, success or setbacks, as long as it's something new.
 
**Doctor:**
You still have plenty of those, don't you?
 
**Doctor:**
Live life with no regrets.
 
**Doctor:**
I believe, above all else, that this is what it means to be moral for an individual&mdash;
 
**Doctor:**
And if you can do that, that would make me very proud.
 
**Doctor:**
Oops...even though it was supposed to be break time, I ended up getting carried away by strange topics.
 
**Doctor:**
Off you go then. Have a nice day. If there's something you'd like to discuss, we'll meet again.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's right, even then.|
 

---

 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
&mdash;Even then?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can't afford to run.|
 

---

 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
Why is that?
 
**Narration:**
At first, it was a curse. I thought I had no choice but to fight. But now it's different.
 
**Narration:**
I've trampled on so many things, I've discarded so many things.
 
**Narration:**
Even then, I still have 'something' that gives me affirmation.
 
**Narration:**
Back then, I shouted 'to live'.
 
**Narration:**
With those words, I overturned that 'virtue'.
 
**Narration:**
Then, I need to give my own answer.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
Hmm. What might that answer be?
 
**Fujimaru:**
I don't know yet. All I have is the desire to live.
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
Hah. You call that a desire?
 
**Fujimaru:**
I do. Is that wrong of me? Wishes usually tend to be self-serving.
 
**Fujimaru:**
I've come to this point for the sake of seeing that selfishness through.
 
**Fujimaru:**
To understand why I think so, I will continue to move forward.
 
**Fujimaru:**
I won't say something like 'I'm not confident' or 'it's not worth it' at this point.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I won't let it end for a reason like that&mdash;!|
 

---

 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
Seriously?
 
**Fujimaru in the Garden of Dejection:**
Well, I'll be damned. Have humans always been this stubborn?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Huh?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This place...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Artoria! Oh thank goodness you're both all right...!
 
**Artoria:**
Uh, Mash? Is this...real?
 
**Artoria:**
The Garden of Dejection wasn't out of magical energy, so why did it stop...
 
**Artoria:**
Oh wow, you smashed it to bits! Whoa, that's ballsy! And it was like a national treasure too!
 
**Mash:**
Ah...I don't know what to say, I panicked...!
 
**Mash:**
It was radiating such malicious magical energy, and I didn't know what to do...!
 
**Mash:**
D-did you say ballsy!?
 
**Artoria:**
No, that was the best thing you could have done. I was too absorbed with its value to do that.
 
**Artoria:**
Thanks to your judgement, both Fujimaru and I are safe now.
 
**Artoria:**
The Garden of Dejection, Lost Will, is a suicide charm. It's a spell that robs the will of those it imprisons.
 
**Artoria:**
I...didn't have anything like that, so it didn't hurt me too bad, but...
 
**Artoria:**
If Fujimaru had stayed in there for any longer, {(M)he/(F)she} might have&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Might have...
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;or maybe you wouldn't have! After all, I don't know what happened to you!
 
**Artoria:**
What's wrong with you, Fujimaru!? Are you as dense as Bageko!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, you got upset awfully quick.|
 
**Artoria:**
Lay off! You're starting to sound like Habetrot!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...???
 
**Mash:**
Alright. Artoria is in a state of just waking up.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Well no, but if I did see something like that I'd be more pissed off than surprised.
 
**Artoria:**
I mean, how serious are you? It makes me wonder...
 
**Mash:**
I see, I understand.
 
**Mash:**
Senpai's mental state does not change whether acting as Master or not.
 
**Mash:**
When {(M)he/(F)she} eats at mealtime, {(M)he/(F)she} seems very relaxed too, but actually {(M)he/(F)she} is very into it.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's that?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you mean?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
No, that's not it...
 
**Artoria:**
...actually, yeah, it kinda is. You don't run away, do you?
 
**Artoria:**
It was the same in Norwich. You ran off to the harbor even though everyone else stopped.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But you didn't run either.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Oh yeah, that's right! But I didn't go to the harbor.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well no, it's not like that.|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You were the Child of Prophecy long before that.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Count Peperon:**
Oh dear, is that love in the air!? But it's a different type of love I'm sensing!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pepe!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Our Fairy Deadlord!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
T-that's right, it's thanks to Peperoncino that I found this place!
 
**Mash:**
I chased after Baobhan Sith, but before I could find out where she was,
 
**Mash:**
Peperoncino dashed in!
 
**Count Peperon:**
Yes. I've gone west and east on these long legs of mine. It was a little unbelievable♡
 
**Count Peperon:**
I was worried that I might have to lend a hand too, but little Mash here was like a runaway freight train.
 
**Count Peperon:**
She ran from Edinburgh all the way to New Darlington in a huge cloud of dust.
 
**Count Peperon:**
When you see something like that you just can't ignore it, right? So I just joined in without thinking.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks, Count Peperon. By the way, where are we...?|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
New Darlington.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I noticed Mash since I was watching New Darlington from atop a nearby hill.
 
**Count Peperon:**
This is where Beryl's castle is. I've been looking for a chance to sneak in for a long time.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Morgan's laid down so much surveillance magecraft we haven't had a breakthrough until now, but...
 
**Count Peperon:**
If she had continued on her way, Mash would have charged straight into New Darlington.
 
**Count Peperon:**
So I guessed this must have been fate, stopped her, and we snuck in together.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. We found you thanks to Peperoncino's Shugendou...magecraft, Senpai.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I just tugged on the thread connecting Mash and Fujimaru.
 
**Count Peperon:**
If anything, she saved you.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Nobody knew there was a place like this outside the city.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The outskirts of New Darlington?|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
Yeah. It's a sanctuary built underground.
 
**Count Peperon:**
In the forest near the beach there's a deserted church. That's where we entered from.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Seems like it's full of bad things now, though...
 
**Count Peperon:**
But let's get outside first. This is the lowest level, a prison 80 meters underground.
 
**Count Peperon:**
The path up above ground is a winding one, so make sure your body is all limbered up.
 
**Count Peperon:**
You were locked up in that little box, so your limbs should be all stiff&ndash;Artoria?
 
**Artoria:**
I don't know what the Count is sensing...stuff like love is a bit much for me...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's been a while since I've seen that face.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Artoria. Artoria.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Ah! Y-yes, I'm ready! Of course I am!
 
**Count Peperon:**
(Her shoulders are so stiff...Artoria needs to give herself more time to unwind...)
 
**Count Peperon:**
Well, let's take it step by step. Seems like you don't need my meddling. I guess time will tell.
 
**Artoria:**
...?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Nothing, nothing at aaaaaaall! Let's hurry back to the surface!
 
**Count Peperon:**
There'll be some obstacles on the way, but I'll leave it to you, Fujimaru!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Narration:**
When I was dispatched to the Lostbelt of the British Isle, I was met by nothing but wilderness under the vast expanse of the Fantasy Tree.
 
**Narration:**
It was no country. Britain's “what-if” history had ended in complete disaster.
 
**Narration:**
This history had fallen into ruin a long time ago. Wodime's fears were unfounded.
 
**Narration:**
But truth is, I was bored as well.
 
**Narration:**
So I thought I'd summon a Servant, since I was still a Crypter.
 
**Servant:**
Ruler Servant, Fairy Queen Morgan has answered your summons.
 
**Servant:**
Heir to the witches of the end. Are you my Master?
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
First impressions? The absolute worst. She saw through my backbone with a single glance.
 
**Narration:**
But still, Morgan. The fairy queen, Morgan!
 
**Narration:**
The woman who despised King Arthur. The witch who destroyed Camelot.
 
**Narration:**
What a perfect counter to boredom. It wouldn't be a bad idea to take her and have some fun at the other Lostbelts' expense.
 
**Beryl:**
Yeah, I'm your Master! Nice to meet you, Morgan! We're really going to enjoy ourselves together!
 
**Narration:**
Doesn't matter what, I won't complain so long as I can kill something.
 
**Narration:**
I welcomed her, placed my trust in her, and, well, after a good night's sleep...
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;Ha?
 
**Narration:**
I should have been sleeping outside, but realized I was in a bed so luxurious it made me want to puke.
 
**Morgan:**
Welcome to the Fairy Kingdom, Beryl Gut. Did you sleep well last night?
 
**Morgan:**
The Fantasy Tree is already dead. The Alien God's calculations are none of my concern.
 
**Beryl:**
What are you...whoa, you really did it, didn't you!? What have you done!?
 
**Morgan:**
It's no longer necessary. This Britain is no longer a Lostbelt.
 
**Morgan:**
Nor am I a Servant any longer&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
Beryl Gut. I welcome you as my husband.
 
**Morgan:**
Simply for appearances' sake. This is more convenient for the both of us.
 
**Beryl:**
Uh, what do you mean?
 
**Narration:**
In the span of one night, an entire country and civilization had sprouted up where there once was just wilderness.
 
**Narration:**
I couldn't report this to Wodime. So I just gave in and accepted my position as Morgan's husband.
 
**Beryl:**
After that, well, it's been a crazy six months.
 
**Beryl:**
I told Fairy Knight Tristan—Baobhan Sith—nostalgic tales about pan-human history.
 
**Beryl:**
She was adorable. She'd get this twinkle in her eye and beg me for stories about the outside world.
 
**Beryl:**
She loved the fashions of it. She seemed to love being told all about the latest designs of shoes.
 
**Beryl:**
Looking back on it, she didn't really have any place to stay in the new kingdom.
 
**Beryl:**
That's why I built the National Slaughter Theatre in New Darlington's dumpy pleasure quarter,
 
**Beryl:**
and held as many shows as I could think of.
 
**Beryl:**
There had always been animosity towards Baobhan Sith, but I get the feeling it really exploded when I showed up.
 
**Beryl:**
Ah...I see. Maybe that's why?
 
**Narration:**
Eventually, I figured it out in my own way.
 
**Narration:**
I summoned the Morgan of pan-human history. But the following morning, it was the Lostbelt Morgan who was there.
 
**Narration:**
It's not like there were ever two Morgans in Britain. She's always been a one-woman show.
 
**Narration:**
The answer is simple. At some point, she changed into the Lostbelt Morgan.
 
**Morgan:**
Yes. “I” was summoned by you, and perceived the end of Britain's Lostbelt.
 
**Morgan:**
Even if this Britain were a “what-if” that died out 2,000 years previously&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
Such a state is unacceptable.
 
**Morgan:**
I immediately comprehended the history of this Lostbelt and the techniques of Chaldea which summoned me&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
I unraveled the concept of Rayshifting, and put it into practice.
 
**Beryl:**
I knew it! You're a monster among monsters, a genius among geniuses!
 
**Beryl:**
You Rayshifted yourself back in time! And you rewrote history!
 
**Beryl:**
After you were summoned, you only took a few hours to grasp the situation, find a method, think of a plan, and execute it!
 
**Beryl:**
Wait a second.
 
**Beryl:**
Were you in such a rush because it wouldn't have worked if I'd known the former Lostbelt better?
 
**Morgan:**
Yes...You needed to be unconscious for me to alter the past.
 
**Morgan:**
The only thing that can be sent via Rayshift is information.
 
**Morgan:**
A physical body requires a coffin to transform it into pseudo-spiritrons to be sent into a Singularity.
 
**Morgan:**
It is a well-documented theory of magecraft, possible only because Singularities are outside normal space-time.
 
**Morgan:**
But in the end, it is nothing more than a correction of a “distortion.” The system only works within the limits of a Singularity.
 
**Morgan:**
As Rayshifting is not truly time travel, you cannot use it to alter the past.
 
**Morgan:**
However&ndash;“I” existed in this Lostbelt.
 
**Morgan:**
In the year 4000 of the fairy calendar. The Fairy of Paradise, dispatched from Avalon.
 
**Beryl:**
You sent “yourself” as information...
 
**Beryl:**
Servants are Ghost Liners—Boundary Record Bands... in short, they're information.
 
**Beryl:**
If the destination is anything other than a Singularity, the Servant will naturally just vanish.
 
**Beryl:**
But&ndash;if someone receives that information... if they have an account that can receive the e-mail, that's a different story.
 
**Beryl:**
The witch who defeated King Arthur and lost her dominion over Great Britain.
 
**Beryl:**
She who was denied control of the island by the very land itself, Queen Morgan.
 
**Beryl:**
So the summoned Morgan entrusted those memories, that information, to the Morgan born in this Lostbelt?
 
**Morgan:**
Correct. Upon the Rayshift, the pan-human history Morgan that you summoned was no more.
 
**Morgan:**
But in exchange for her sacrifice, the Lostbelt Morgan gained knowledge of her own fate.
 
**Morgan:**
The original Fairy Calendar—the “first” one—fell to ruin when the Fairy of Paradise was murdered.
 
**Morgan:**
This was because all the prominent fairies died in the Great Calamity by the year 12000.
 
**Morgan:**
I was taught this fact by the “me” of pan-human history, so I escaped the blades of the fairies and survived.
 
**Morgan:**
And so...I averted the ruinous future and made wither the Fantasy Tree.
 
**Morgan:**
A Lostbelt will disappear if the Fantasy Tree is destroyed, but conversely, that presents an opportunity.
 
**Morgan:**
If someone can maintain the “world” after that, it would cease to be a fantasy and become reality.
 
**Morgan:**
That is the world you are in now. A world that has changed from the Fairy Calendar to the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Morgan:**
I built it, and it is mine. No one may take it from me anymore&mdash;my Fairy Kingdom of Britain.
 
**Narration:**
Sheesh, what an awful woman.
 
**Narration:**
While I was asleep she sent just her “will” to the past, then she died.
 
**Narration:**
And afterwards, the Lostbelt Morgan who inherited said will withered the Fantasy Tree and created a history all of her own.
 
**Narration:**
Gives me chills to think about, but I might have actually died at that point.
 
**Narration:**
After all, I had seen the Britain of 2017, where the Fantasy Tree was still in one piece.
 
**Narration:**
I died that night, and by the next morning, Morgan had prepared a double of me.
 
**Morgan:**
You disapprove?
 
**Beryl:**
No, not really!
 
**Beryl:**
After all, this is the second time I've been brought back to life for someone else's convenience, so it's no big deal!
 
**Beryl:**
But from here on, it's different. So long as there's no Fantasy Tree, the Queen's Calendar is fixed.
 
**Beryl:**
You can't bring back the dead and make them fit in. You can't even mess with the visitors who will come later.
 
**Beryl:**
Those Chaldeans will trample all over your Britain without mercy, you know?
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;They are inconsequential. Only your comrade can stand against me&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
The Lostbelt of Olympus, whose Fantasy Tree will grow until it covers the planet.
 
**Beryl:**
Whoa. You want to attack a different Lostbelt?
 
**Beryl:**
Well, I guess that is a bit of an urgent issue for you...
 
**Beryl:**
Wodime's one tough customer. And the gods of Olympus seem like they'd be a problem too.
 
**Beryl:**
I mean, Wodime's not especially pitiful or interesting, so...
 
**Beryl:**
As a murder victim, the risk and reward don't really add up.
 
**Morgan:**
Are you saying you don't want to fight the Crypter of Olympus...?
 
**Morgan:**
I thought that all you Crypters were competing with each other.
 
**Morgan:**
Were you not all resurrected to see who would become ruler of this planet?
 
**Beryl:**
Nope. I don't know about the rest of them, but that ain't for me. I don't want to be a king in the least.
 
**Morgan:**
Then why did you answer the call of the Alien God? Was it merely to keep on living?
 
**Beryl:**
You got it. I died without warning, and if I hadn't taken the offer, I'd still be dead.
 
**Beryl:**
It's only human nature to take the chance to come back to life, isn't it?
 
**Morgan:**
No. You are not so obsessed with your own life. Be it your own or someone else's, you do not believe that life is special.
 
**Morgan:**
Your nature is to simply revel in the moment. You do not bother with thinking about what comes next.
 
**Morgan:**
Nor do you care when it comes to an end. A man such as yourself would never come back “just to live.”
 
**Beryl:**
You're thinking too highly of me, Your Majesty. I'm just a hedonist.
 
**Beryl:**
Living is a pain in the ass anyway. But so long as that's outweighed by my fun, I'll keep plugging away at it.
 
**Beryl:**
Like that Fairy Knight Gawain. She seems interesting, so I'm sure that would be fun.
 
**Beryl:**
Or that Spriggan guy. He's boring. Worse than watching a B-movie.
 
**Beryl:**
I'm that kind of guy, Morgan.
 
**Beryl:**
By the way, you're the boring type. I can't spend my time with someone like you.
 
**Beryl:**
Don't worry, you can keep playing queen. At my level, there's no way I could kill you anyway!
 
**Morgan:**
...
 
**Morgan:**
Then what of Tristan? Which type is my daughter to you?
 
**Beryl:**
Ah, Lady Spinel. A beautiful ruby. What a cute girl. She's something to be treasured. Still&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
She's “already finished.” It's not that I pity her, but she doesn't seem interesting.
 
**Morgan:**
...
 
**Beryl:**
Just hurting someone like that is painful. It makes me want to ruin her future in a glorious way.
 
**Beryl:**
Even I think I'm a total bastard.
 
**Beryl:**
Killing such a pitiful thing now&mdash;that's what love means to me.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Mash:**
Did you feel a tremor just now? It almost feels like the prelude to an earthquake...
 
**Artoria:**
An earthquake? Earthquakes rarely occur in Britain, though...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's hurry. I have a bad feeling about this.|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Pepe? Uhm...are you not feeling well?
 
**Mash:**
I feel like you've been acting strange for a while now...
 
**Count Peperon:**
Dear me, you're paying attention to me even at a time like this.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Don't mind me, I just felt a little sad. Just a little apprehensive, is all.
 
**Count Peperon:**
But I am happy that you care about me. &mdash;Thank you, Mash.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Now, after we pass through that door, we'll be in the hallway and out of the maze. After that, we make a beeline for the surface.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Let's make a dash for it. You're still just halfway through, aren't you?
 
**???:**
Aaa&ndash;...aaaaaaa&ndash;...uuuuuuuuu&ndash;...
 
**???:**
Haaaa...aaaaaa...aaaaaaaa&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are these people...!?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Ah! These people are rotting...! They're the corpses of Darlington!
 
**Artoria:**
The Calamity that attacked Darlington a century ago, the reanimated dead...!
 
**Artoria:**
I see, so this was a human cemetery...!
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Since they're attacking us, we have no choice but to fight! Let's minimize combat and secure a path upstairs!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Beryl:**
What? You're not going for it? What a let down.
 
**Beryl:**
Even though I unlocked the observation room and let out all those Mors humans?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Beryl!|
 
**Beryl:**
Hey Fujimaru, if it isn't our third meeting! At this point we aren't strangers anymore, are we?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Mors humans, you say...? Is that how it is?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mors humans...?
 
**Beryl:**
What, no hello? That's cold, kouhai.
 
**Beryl:**
Even though I rushed all the way here from the lord's chambers of New Darlington.
 

---

 
**Beryl:**
Yeah, as you can see, they're humans. Calling them undead isn't exactly the right term.
 
**Beryl:**
There's only one undead left in Britain. These fellows here are the result of my six months of research.
 
**Beryl:**
To see what would happen if I infected humans with the Mors curse. As you can see, this is the result.
 
**Beryl:**
Living yet dead. Dead yet living.
 
**Beryl:**
All they can do is seek help from anyone that's around since living is suffering for them...
 
**Beryl:**
Not bad for a “parting gift,” though.
 
**Beryl:**
After all, the Mors poison that used to only kill fairies now affects humans as well, see?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(If we had engaged...we would've also been...)
 

---

 
**Beryl:**
Still, I had taken Mash into account. But to think even you would be here, Peperoncino.
 
**Beryl:**
To think you'd come stomping all the way over to Britain to avenge Wodime.
 
**Beryl:**
Were you always like that? Weren't you more like me, if anything?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Well, yes. You're the cleanup crew and I'm the hitman. I was never a 'good person' to begin with.
 
**Count Peperon:**
So this isn't about good and evil. I came here to kill you. To settle the score.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I am inhuman, after all. Killing someone because they pissed me off is a good enough reason, no?
 
**Beryl:**
I see, sounds about right! It's all about acting on feelings and no room for discussion!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Another earthquake...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This tremor, it can't be
 

---

 
**Beryl:**
Well, as you can see, this is an old cemetery. I figured some redecorating was in order!
 
**Beryl:**
I went overboard with the experiments, so I'm going to get rid of the evidence before Morgan finds out!
 
**Beryl:**
I could have kept my mouth shut about this, but it's the least I can do for my fellow A-Team buddies, you know?
 
**Beryl:**
Peperoncino, Mash, if you stick around here, you'll be buried alive.
 
**Beryl:**
Fujimaru aside, you guys might just make it out in time.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait, Beryl...!|
 
**Mash:**
But Beryl said they&mdash;these people are still alive&mdash;
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We need to get these people out too...!
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
Stay away from them! There's no saving them anymore!
 
**Count Peperon:**
We're still underground, and just as liable to die here!
 
**Count Peperon:**
First, secure an escape route! Helping others comes after that!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger!|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
I'll shield you with magecraft! Let's hurry upstairs, Fujimaru!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did we make it...!?|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
No, we're still underground. The way to the surface is at the end of the cathedral&mdash;
 
**Count Peperon:**
Get back! Go back to the stairs!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The door closed...!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Pepe!?
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
&mdash;Whew, that was close. I made it just in time.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Are you hurt? No? Thank goodness, sorry about sending you flying there. I know I'm rather leggy♡
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's the matter, Count Peperon!?|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
Hmm, poison gas? Something like that? It's being disseminated.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Wait a minute, I'll go turn off the gas.
 
**Count Peperon:**
It'll be fine. I've been trained in Shugendou. I have a strong karma. I should be able to handle several peoples' worth.
 
**Mash:**
Karma...? Umm, what exactly do you mean&mdash;
 
**Count Peperon:**
Hm, let's say three minutes. If I wasn't so tired, it'd go faster.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Fujimaru, Mash. Will you have faith in me and wait until then?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Of course.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Three minutes, right...?
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
Yes. Well, I'm off to finish the job then.
 
**Count Peperon:**
It's been a while since I went all out. Fufu, this is getting exciting!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's been three minutes. I'm opening it...!|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
Oh dear, it's already been three minutes? How time flies.
 
**Count Peperon:**
As you can see, I'm done with the cleanup. Now then, shall we head to the surface before this place collapses?
 
**Mash:**
As expected of Pepe, but...
 
**Mash:**
What kind of gas was it?
 
**Mash:**
It's 40 meters above us, but there's a skylight. Was the gas heavier than air?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Something like that. We're in a crypt, after all, there's no telling what's been festering.
 
**Artoria:**
Uhm...how should I put it, Count Peperon, you...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria?|
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
Oh my, what a passionate look. I wonder if this is the continuation of that love gossip from earlier!
 
**Artoria:**
No, it's nothing...
 
**Count Peperon:**
No? How unfortunate. Even though that was our chance to have a girls' talk.
 
**Count Peperon:**
This must have been how you've lived your life so far, Artoria.
 
**Count Peperon:**
I wonder if that's a fine thing, but it came in handy this time. Well then, I'll be counting on you 'till the very end, okay?
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Count Peperon:**
Looks like the lower floors have completely collapsed. We aren't safe here either. Let's hurry.
 
**Mash:**
Yes! The exit is right over there, please follow me!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's the exit&mdash;!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Master! There's a strong magical energy signature up ahead...it's hostile!
 
**Beryl:**
Come on, don't tell me you actually got here safely!? What the hell's going on here!?
 
**Beryl:**
There's got to be at least one or two casualties here, you know!? More importantly, Fujimaru&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
What's with that face? Man, I misjudged you! Still the heroic Master protecting the Human Order!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is Beryl even saying&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 

---

 
**Count Peperon:**
There's no point in wasting your time with someone like him...to tell the truth, I wanted to take care of him myself...
 
**Count Peperon:**
Fujimaru, Mash, Artoria. Will you do me the favor of sending him flying?
 
**Count Peperon:**
Beat him into submission. Make sure he can never do any evil again.
 
**Mash:**
Roger...! There's no time, if he's going to get in our way, we'll force our way through!
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;Oh, is that so? You never did like games, did you?
 
**Beryl:**
No helping it. Guess I'll have to use my trump card too.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He repelled Mash's attack...!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(That's not human strength...!)
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
The color of this magical energy...! Get back, everyone! He, he's&mdash;
 
**F：Beryl:**
&mdash;aaaaa&mdash;haaaaaaa...
 
**F：Beryl:**
My apologies... I didn't want to show you this either...
 
**F：Beryl:**
But I really, really want to be alone with Mash already. I'm going to have to ask everyone else to leave now.
 
**Artoria:**
Woodwose...! That Saint Graph, it's Fang Clan&ndash;it's Woodwose's Saint Graph!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Beryl:**
What's the matter? Out of breath? That's no good. I'm in the zone over here.
 
**Beryl:**
I went out of my way to copy Woodwose's Saint Graph. Let's go hard, real hard.
 
**Mash:**
That form just now was Woodwose's!? Not Wryneck's!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, the chief of the Fang Clan.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wryneck?
 
**Mash:**
He was one of Tonelico's companions! No, their abilities are incomparable...!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Either way, it still doesn't change the fact that he possesses the Saint Graph of an A-Rei...!
 
**Artoria:**
But right now, we have no means of breaking through the Archduke of Exhaust Heat's hide...!
 
**Beryl:**
Fu&mdash;fu, fuuuu&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
Man, the Child of Prophecy is a smart one. She knows there's no point in resisting.
 
**Beryl:**
It'd do you good to know your own fates. That 'you have no option other than to die here'.
 
**Beryl:**
Ain't that right, Peperoncino!? I know you're coming at me from behind!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pepe...!|
 

---

 
**Beryl:**
There we go, one down! So long, Peperoncino!
 
**Beryl:**
Well, I could've killed the likes of you whenever I wanted! I've only been letting you off the hook because we're birds of a feather&ndash;what?
 
**Beryl:**
Ugh, uuuuuuuuuuuegh...! I feel sick, I feel sick...!
 
**Beryl:**
What the hell did you do, you bastard, this is, it's&mdash;
 
**D：Count Peperon:**
You know full well what it is, no? The stuff you've been experimenting on others with.
 
**D：Count Peperon:**
I took on 500 people's worth all at once. And now you have too.
 
**H：Beryl:**
Wha&ndash;you bastard, what's that look? Don't tell me, you've already&ndash;!
 
**D：Count Peperon:**
That's right! I was already on the verge of death!
 
**D：Count Peperon:**
After all, it's a curse that's 'transferred to the one who kills you'! How's the taste of the damned curse you came up with yourself!?
 
**H：Beryl:**
Kh&mdash;khh, ueeeeeeeegh...!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Count Peperon:**
Get back! Go back to the stairs!
 
**Count Peperon:**
...200...300...goodness, they're endless.
 
**Count Peperon:**
It feels like everybody he messed with in the lower levels was brought here.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Beryl's specialty was botany. I knew he was a specialist in witch's drugs and magecraft...
 
**Count Peperon:**
To think he can abuse the curse to this extent. English witches sure are scary...
 
**Count Peperon:**
It's a bit unreasonable to try and avoid this and still make it to the exit.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Draw close, and they chase you for help. Touch them, and you get infected. Kill them, and the curse spreads to you.
 
**Count Peperon:**
Well, the poison doesn't work on Mash, so it probably won't have an effect on {(M)him/(F)her} either so...
 
**Count Peperon:**
That's the point. “Have them kill innocent people who can't resist.”
 
**Count Peperon:**
It's just harassment, but it's the most effective.
 
**Count Peperon:**
To both Fujimaru and Mash, that is. In that case...
 
**Peperoncino:**
I might be a wretch, but I am the senpai here. How could I leave this to those guys?
 
**Peperoncino:**
&mdash;Well done. Now for the illusion...
 
**Peperoncino:**
Pull these kids to the edge, hide all the splatter...
 
**Peperoncino:**
Oh no, I'm in trouuuuble! My makeup and outfit are all ruined!
 
**Peperoncino:**
That's right. If you kill someone, you have to carry that weight.
 
**Peperoncino:**
My internal organs are all messed up and my skin's all dried out. Guess I shouldn't worry about how I look anymore♡
 
**Peperoncino:**
If I was a decent person, I'd exit the stage here, but... sorry, everyone.
 
**Peperoncino:**
Can we hold off the curtain call for a little while longer? Let me take care of the unfinished business in front of me first.
 
**Beryl:**
Ge&mdash;ghhh, uraaaaaaa...!
 
**Beryl:**
You bastard, this is the Fang lord's body...! How could the Mors curse affect...!
 
**Peperoncino:**
Yet it did! My curse was mixed in!
 
**Beryl:**
You reversed it!? That's pretty unmanly even for someone with a face like yours!
 
**Peperoncino:**
Ah, ow...! Don't make me laugh, Beryl! My stomach really hurts!
 
**Mash:**
Pepe! Please don't laugh! We'll treat your&mdash;
 
**Peperoncino:**
Thanks! But I don't need it!
 
**Peperoncino:**
Take it away&mdash;Fujimaru!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;You got it!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's do it, Mash...!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Right!
 
**Mash:**
Enemy unit, designated Black Wolf&mdash; commencing all-out counterattack!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Beryl:**
Haah, aaah, gaaaaaaah...!
 
**Beryl:**
D-damn it, how the hell did it end up this way...!? You really outdid yourself, Peperoncino!
 
**Beryl:**
Fine, I get it, I screwed up! I lost, so time to make tracks...!
 
**Artoria:**
Wall-jumping all the way up to the skylight... there's no way we can follow him...but more importantly...
 
**Peperoncino:**
...  
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pepe!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Pepe!
 
**Peperoncino:**
Ah. Did I doze off!? How did I miss the whole scene!?
 
**Peperoncino:**
But...looks like it all worked out. I can tell from your faces. You both look like you're about to cry.
 
**Peperoncino:**
That's no good, if you win you have to smile and high-five. You'll ruin the mood like this.
 
**Mash:**
But&mdash;but...! Pepe...Pepe, you&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
All on your own&mdash;and we never even knew you were helping us&mdash;!
 
**Peperoncino:**
Oh dear, whatever are you talking about?
 
**Peperoncino:**
I'm just a man who tried and failed to take Beryl by surprise.
 
**Peperoncino:**
Naturally, this would happen.
 
**Peperoncino:**
So of course I'll have to take responsibility for it, won't I?
 
**Peperoncino:**
More importantly...you have to hurry and get out of here. After all, this was always just a detour, wasn't it?
 
**Peperoncino:**
I'm done for. I'm already dead, so don't worry about me.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
At least come outside...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course I'm worried about you...!
 

---

 
**Peperoncino:**
Now, now. It'd be one thing if it was Mash, but you can't be this way, Fujimaru, alright?
 
**Peperoncino:**
A corpse is a heavy thing to keep as baggage. Especially if it's soaked in curses.
 
**Peperoncino:**
Remember, we're supposed to be enemies. We could have parted ways at any time&mdash;
 
**Peperoncino:**
Plus, I'm a ghastly murderer, you know? I just happened to have good intentions this time.
 
**Peperoncino:**
The life I've led isn't something you should feel sorry for.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But&mdash;|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not the you I know.|
 

---

 
**Peperoncino:**
Yeah...
 
**Peperoncino:**
I'm glad it wasn't. I was really glad that my wonderful kouhais didn't have to hate me.
 
**Mash:**
Pepe...
 
**Peperoncino:**
That's why you shouldn't cry. Me and Beryl, we're the same.
 
**Peperoncino:**
The both of us are fundamentally awful people. We thought more about the end than the journey.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;That's...|
 

---

 
**Peperoncino:**
You understand why people like us break the rules? It's not because we want to do bad things.
 
**Peperoncino:**
We just wanted to get out of “continuing to be.”
 
**Peperoncino:**
The laws that humans impose are so they can thrive longer and more efficiently...it's human nature.
 
**Peperoncino:**
So if you go against them, disregard them, or break them&mdash;the bill eventually comes back to you.
 
**Peperoncino:**
But, you're different. You're the type who wants to keep going, right?
 
**Peperoncino:**
Then see it through. Run, run, and never stop running&mdash;
 
**Peperoncino:**
Run so far that you can't see someone like me behind you anymore.
 
**Peperoncino:**
I can't go that far, but I can't die alone. I'm a coward.
 
**Peperoncino:**
Come on, take Mash with you. You're a Master, aren't you, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah... Thanks, Pepe. It was a lot of fun!|
 

---

 
**Peperoncino:**
Yeah, it sure was.
 
**Peperoncino:**
You've come this far. Save Britain and save Artoria.
 
**Peperoncino:**
Hehe. We're in the same boat. You can get a sense of the curses spreading throughout Britain.
 
**Peperoncino:**
You get it? Your true enemy is whoever's trying to kill you.
 
**Peperoncino:**
Make sure you remember that. Don't let your guard down until it's all over, alright?
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
Aah...we've finally made it to the exit. This means I'm finally done with everything.
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
It's not scary or painful now...but the memories remain a little painful...
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;Killed. &mdash;Killed.
 
**Narration:**
While everyone was asleep, the moon disappeared behind the clouds for a few minutes.
 
**Narration:**
Every single member of my clan in Oyama was killed.
 
**Narration:**
Just like the sick people I saw earlier. Those helpless people were cut down like they were grass.
 
**Narration:**
When I was ten, I had a lot expected of me. I was called the greatest genius since the founder.
 
**Narration:**
I wanted to live up to those expectations, but it was basically impossible.
 
**Narration:**
I was born with different tastes. My body and mind weren't in sync with each other.
 
**Narration:**
My spirit ran against the format prescribed by the world and society alike.
 
**Narration:**
My family wanted me to become a father and have a bunch of kids so I could pass on all my good genes, but...
 
**Narration:**
Of course, that was impossible.
 
**Narration:**
Some people understood, but things would never go back to how they were.
 
**Narration:**
“If you couldn't do it, you should have given up.”  Whispers like that never bothered me.
 
**Narration:**
I never had resentments or complaints.
 
**Narration:**
“Really. Why was I born this way?”
 
**Narration:**
Nobody begrudged me, hated me, or pitied me.
 
**Narration:**
I was just born this way, so there was nothing to be done about it.
 
**Narration:**
It wasn't something to complain about, and it wasn't something to claim rights for.
 
**Narration:**
Still, I did feel a little sorry.
 
**Narration:**
“So this is the end of my reincarnations, huh? There won't be any more after this.”
 
**Narration:**
Roshintsuu allows us to perceive our own fate.
 
**Narration:**
When I was ten, I realized this life would be my last reincarnation.
 
**Narration:**
If this had been one in between, I might still have gotten sad. But since this was the “last me”,
 
**Narration:**
I remembered the pity I had for the fate handed down to human beings, and the imperfections in this transient world.
 
**Narration:**
And so, ten years later.
 
**Narration:**
Since there was nothing more I could learn there, I decided to come down from the mountain.
 
**Narration:**
Before that, I did what I had to do.
 
**Narration:**
Right before they died, everyone's face was asking “why.”
 
**Narration:**
Comrades who shared their joys and sufferings together. People who were like family to me, even if they were outsiders.
 
**Narration:**
Still, I loved all the Myourenji.
 
**Narration:**
“That child isn't a sprout. We should just be easier on him.”
 
**Narration:**
“What are you saying? You're still naive. Blind him and kill his brother. That'll bring him to his senses.”
 
**Narration:**
“Yeah, you're right. Rather than killing two people, let's take the chance of one of them remaining.”
 
**Narration:**
“Yeah, that's good. That's usually how it is with us, no?”
 
**Narration:**
When I overheard that conversation, I cried as I thought this karma should be removed from modern society.
 
**Narration:**
That was the last memory of Myourenji Arou. Since then, I've completely forgotten what happened on Oyama.
 
**Narration:**
I don't think of it as my past anymore. It's a sin to me.
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
&mdash;We really are bastards.
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
After everything I've done, it's all turned into beautiful memories.
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
Well, it's my karma to die alone, right? I killed them all myself.
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
It's not fair for me to ask for a good ending&mdash;ah.
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
That's why, huh...? Even if you come now, it's too late.
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
Hah...hahaha...really&mdash;
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
Hehe. No matter how you look at it, I thought it was sudden.
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
Thank you, Daybit. For back then&mdash;
 
**Myourenji Arou:**
You used your one-time express ticket to come see me when I was at my most beautiful.

**Fujimaru 1:**
That rumbling just now was probably&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Pepe...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
My acquaintance with the Count was not a long one...
 
**Artoria:**
But just as he himself said, I knew he had killed a great many people.
 
**Artoria:**
He had no sympathy for those he killed. And he would not feel sorry for his own death either.
 
**Artoria:**
That was the sort of cold-hearted person he was, and why we don't have to worry about him here.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;However...
 
**Artoria:**
At the same time, he held no hesitation or deceit in him. Not once did he lie to you all.
 
**Artoria:**
It was almost scary how true he was to himself, and he did what he wanted to do.
 
**Artoria:**
Uhm...that's why, even now...how should I put it?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He did what he loved.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Myourenji was always a helpful person.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Yes. The Count surely would have laughed and said the same.
 
**Artoria:**
He was a mysterious person, all the way...
 
**Artoria:**
Of all the people I've met, he was the most impartial one, both towards himself and those around him.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Alright,|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go!|
 

---

 
**Red Rabbit:**
Found them! I've found them! As expected of Master Da Vinci, what excellent tracking!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes, thank goodness I added a camera function to Tifone!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Heeey, Fujimaru, Mash, Artoria~!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Are you alriiight!? I'm here now~!
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see...so Pepe...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
We've lost a good man...if possible, I would have wanted him to govern Norwich...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Let's cut the condolences. Da Vinci, you have something to report, no?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I don't mind saying it but I believe that's your role.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's right. Artoria, Oberon has sent you an urgent message.
 
**Da Vinci:**
“The Round Table Army has taken Oxford.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
“Preparations have been made to ring the Pilgrim's Bell. I would like you to come before the Queen's army returns.”
 
**Da Vinci:**
While we were on a northward pilgrimage, Percival has triumphed over the Fang Clan.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's no need to fight this time. Let's head for Oxford immediately!
 
## Section 22: The Last Knight 
 
**Oberon:**
My, arriving here from New Darlington in only half a day is nothing short of super-express.
 
**Oberon:**
Do we have Red Rab-bit to thank? It seems replacing the carriage with an improved model was worth it.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're back, Oberon!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My back and butt are a wreck.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Good, good. You're looking well. Welcome back, everyone. You're more dependable than ever.
 
**Percival:**
Everyone looks safe and sound. Well done on your expedition to Orkney.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Hm, just you, Percival?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Gareth is...right, still in Londonium. It's a shame, but no point lingering on it.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I'm impressed, Percival. Taking a city with walls like this is quite the feat.
 
**Percival:**
No, it was all thanks to Artoria.
 
**Percival:**
After laying siege to the city, there were a few talks that were, let's say, less than productive.
 
**Percival:**
We were poised for a battle of attrition, until the sound of Orkney's bell came our way.
 
**Percival:**
The toll of the fourth bell boosted the morale of the Round Table Army and spread havoc through Oxford.
 
**Oberon:**
Yes, Percival is humble enough to call the battle protracted. But in truth, the city could have fallen in a matter of days.
 
**Oberon:**
The Fang Clan aren't the only inhabitants within. The Earth and Wind Clans also reside in the city.
 
**Oberon:**
With their discontent, the atmosphere in Oxford was at a fever pitch.
 
**Oberon:**
It isn't so much fear of the Round Table Army's encirclement as it is resentments among those in the Fang Clan whom have seen little advancement in their ranks.
 
**Oberon:**
It created a lot of internal pressure. Enough even to cause the Fang Clan to change allegiances.
 
**Oberon:**
They never served Morgan wholeheartedly. Woodwose was merely enthralled with the Queen.
 
**Oberon:**
With him out of the picture, and the clan left without a leader, they were honestly lost on what to do.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see. So that's how the negotiations went.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But what was it that you discussed?
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Fang Clan are a clan that specialize in combat. I wouldn't think they'd be quick to make neither peace nor new allies.
 
**Percival:**
Right...aside from my army, there are many fairies among the other cities' volunteers with grievances against the Fang Clan.
 
**Percival:**
In particular, some of Woodwose's officers were personally engaged in the looting of many forest villages.
 
**Percival:**
I have received many pleas for vengeance, as well...
 
**Percival:**
To that end, it would be difficult to integrate the Fang Clan into the rebel force under present circumstances.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But you couldn't leave things as they were. On the other hand...
 
**Da Vinci:**
It would prove impractical to confine them all at Londinium as prisoners of war until the rebellion against the Queen was over, right?
 
**Percival:**
That was a point of concern for us as well. But then, Muryan made a suggestion.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Muryan? From Gloucester?
 
**Percival:**
Yes. If the safety of the Fang Clan is guaranteed, Gloucester will side with the rebel army.
 
**Percival:**
As an emergency wartime measure, the Fang Clan will be accepted at Gloucester as a last resort.
 
**Percival:**
“Surrendering soldiers will be guaranteed safety at Gloucester.” That was the winning move for this bloodless siege.
 
**Percival:**
I had to restrain the Fang Clan who surrendered as a gesture for our soldiers.
 
**Percival:**
However, upon arriving in Gloucester, they will be released and be free to move about.
 
**Percival:**
Lady Muryan will enlist them as mercenaries and assign them as Gloucester's guards, and its de facto army.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It was touch and go for a while, but you did it...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
More Anti-Queen forces, but...will it work out?
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, it's two birds with one stone. We take the yahoos off the table, and make nice with Muryan.
 
**Oberon:**
As long as we were ringing the bells in the first place, Gloucester was already halfway in our camp.
 
**Oberon:**
With this, we've bought a bit of breathing room. Isn't it refreshing?
 
**Artoria:**
That may be true...
 
**Artoria:**
But then, were the Fang Clan taken to Gloucester yesterday?
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, every one of them who surrendered here along with the prisoners already at Londinium.
 
**Oberon:**
There are still more Fangs scattered through the country. Any but those who live in Camelot are welcome here.
 
**Oberon:**
Woodwose had forbidden his clanfolk from indulging themselves outside of their restaurants.
 
**Oberon:**
By now, I'm sure they should be arriving with relief in the glitters of Gloucester!
 
**Muryan:**
...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
You don't look well, Lady Muryan. Is something the matter?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
If you're tired, you should rest.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
If you would like me to show you to the Fang Clan, I can do that.
 
**Muryan:**
Whatever do you mean, Koyanskaya? I couldn't be in better form.
 
**Muryan:**
The time has finally come. No, I've been ready for it for a very long time.
 
**Muryan:**
I haven't felt this light since I was in the library at the royal palace. Muryan is flying high!
 
**Muryan:**
Oh, but would you like to look at this piece, since you're here? It's quite the jewel of my collection.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Oh, of course I would! I was quite interested~☆ I do love unknown technology~☆
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Wow, so this goes like that. And that goes like this.  Look at that, even the water quality is reproduced!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Whereas the building...yes, it's quite detailed... even with double beds...well...
 
**Muryan:**
What do you think? Does it meet your standards?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Yes, you have me green with envy.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
The quality draws the eye, and the originality fools it.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Elaborate, exquisite, first-rate in beauty. There is no tool in our company quite so...thorough.
 
**Muryan:**
Thank you, Lady Fox. Now that you're feeling better, I'm off to work.
 
**Muryan:**
May I ask you to guard the room, just in case?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Oh...? Should I be the one to&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Of course, I'll see to it. No rodent shall get past me in your absence.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Although...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Are you sure you want to do this? If it's something you can do at any time, can't you save it for later?
 
**Muryan:**
That doesn't sound like you. When a chance presents itself, should you not take it?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
In that case...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I cannot claim to know how you feel, Lady Muryan...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
However, it's natural for fools to commit foolish actions. Nothing can change the big picture, but...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Ruin looms when a wise man does so. Do you understand that, Lady Muryan?
 
**Muryan:**
I do apologize for the inconvenience. All your shackles have been removed.
 
**Muryan:**
Was anyone injured along the way? If you're in any pain, please don't hesitate to make it known.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
Ha! The Fang Clan will not be harmed by human-made shackles! We could've ripped them off at any time!
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
See here, we didn't come all this way just because we gave in to the Round Table Army.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
You begged for our services in order to save face, just so we're clear.
 
**Muryan:**
Why, but of course...and I thank you all for doing so.
 
**Muryan:**
Her Majesty and the rebel army. The chaos following the battle to come at Camelot is inevitable.
 
**Muryan:**
Gloucester is a neutral city, but I can't make that any clearer to the starving insurgents.
 
**Muryan:**
It's against the rules of the Wing Clan, but Gloucester needs to be able to fight for a time.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
Hmph. That's just how a winged bug would see the situation.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
Your people have always sponged off the more powerful.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
No, there isn't a “your people” anymore, is there? It's just you all alone now in the Wing Clan. They're as good as extinct.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
And yet you still cling to the pride of your clan. Such a greedy insect.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
And like an insect, getting crushed to death underfoot would suit you just fine!
 
**Young Fang Clan A:**
... (There goes Baingan, running his mouth without reading the room...)
 
**Young Fang Clan B:**
(He's become the clan head by default following Lord Woodwose's death...)
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
Hey boys, don't you agree? The Wing Clan isn't part of the six clans anymore!
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
Y-yeah, you can say that again! Hahahahahahahaha... ha.
 
**Muryan:**
Hehehe, you put it so well! I completely agree! Ahahahahahaha!
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
W-well, t-that's good. I'm glad to see you know your place.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
How about you show us to our lodgings?
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
The Fang Clan's got 1,200 claws for general combat, 600 auxiliary claws, and 400 claws in training.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
There was a pledge to welcome all the Fang Clan from Oxford as high-ranking citizens of Gloucester.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
So, where are the ones who arrived ahead of us, and the prisoners from Londinium?
 
**Muryan:**
Naturally, they've all been released and are chatting among themselves throughout the grounds.
 
**Muryan:**
Please, proceed through that door. The party's arrangements are all in place.
 
**Muryan:**
It may not measure up to Oxford's restaurant district, but Gloucester has some unique methods of cooking.
 
**Young Fang Clan:**
(I'm looking forward to Gloucester's cooking!) (Woodwose's vegetarian policy was killing me.)
 
**Young Fang Clan:**
(Just walking through the city was fun!) (Gloucester's cuisine must be really opulent!)
 
**J：Clan of the Fang, Old Guard:**
Oh...very pretty. It's good to have such a view of the city.
 
**J：Clan of the Fang, Old Guard:**
Gloucester is a wonderful city. Too great by half for a winged bug!
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
Well, that all changes today now that Muryan has invited us in.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
Without the Fang Clan, there's no repelling the Mors. Not to mention with war on the horizon,
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
Gloucester will be ours sooner or later. The humans can keep Oxford in our absence.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
That wretched Muryan. She may think she's protecting us, but it's the other way around.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
At any rate, she'll be amazed by our strength and come to rely on us.
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
That's exactly what the welcome party is for! She knows the best host to leech off of!
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
Hahahahahahaha! You got that right!
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
Just like when we were imitating the humans, the weak follow the strong in the end.
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
With that logic-lover Woodwose gone, we of the Fang Clan are now free to wield our power!
 
**???:**
 
&mdash;Sigh, I'm thoroughly amazed. Even after 1,200 years, nothing changes.
 
**???:**
 
Not one of you seem to find anything strange about so odd a venue.
 
**???:**
 
Oh, did your heads shrink smaller to make the rest of you look bigger by comparison?
 
**???:**
 
Well, that's just how it goes. It takes a real piece of garbage to not remember your own deeds.
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
Wh-what the hell is that loud voice? Just where is it&mdash;
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
Wh&mdash;at? What in the...Hey, look outside!
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
Up in the sky...!
 
**Muryan:**
You've finally noticed me? I've been watching you for a whiiiile now.
 
**Muryan:**
Good evening, Fang Clan. Welcome to Muryan's game board.
 
**Muryan:**
We have the whole place to ourselves tonight. You'll entertain me thoroughly, won't you?
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
M-Muryan!?
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
So she's got some kind of Sacrament that makes her grow!? She's not like Spriggan at all!
 
**Muryan:**
Eh, is that your final answer for an explanation? Well, I can never have too many unsightly pieces.
 
**Muryan:**
The City of Gloucester is my Fairy Territory, where I've spent a thousand years fixing the rules.
 
**Muryan:**
The common sense of the outside world doesn't apply here. My judgements alone are law.
 
**Muryan:**
The weak are for the strong, and the strong are for the weak.
 
**Muryan:**
An example of such is this alien common sense that reflects my mentality&mdash;a Bug Space that “shrinks” any and all who enter.
 
**Muryan:**
Do you follow?
 
**Muryan:**
I'm not any larger. You've all become smaller.
 
**Muryan:**
Just like the bugs you've been stepping on all this time, aren't you?
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
Damn you, Muryan! You don't get to look down on the Fang Clan...!
 
**Head of the Clan of the Fang:**
Stop this nonsense and turn us back! You're still just a winged bug who can't survive without our help!
 
**Muryan:**
My, just what I'd expect from the third strongest of the Fang Clan. Your toughness is enough to be enchanting.
 
**Muryan:**
Although...
 
**Muryan:**
You lacked the intelligence to anticipate being crushed by this bug's index finger, didn't you?
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
Baingan is...dead? The strongest warrior of the clan, after Lord Woodwose...?
 
**Muryan:**
Hehe, I'm sorry. He was making noise, so I crushed him♡
 
**Muryan:**
As long as you are on this game board, your power is inferior to that of an ant. If you can get outside, you'll return to being the old, burly Fang Clan.
 
**Muryan:**
But then...
 
**Muryan:**
The only way to get out is to kill me. Any other clan would give up outright.
 
**Muryan:**
But yours is the most powerful in Britain. I might just be defeated! ♡
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
Ee&mdash;eeeeep! We have to get out of heeeere!
 
**Clans of the Fang:**
Out of the hall and into the woods! If we stay here, we'll be crushed! Gyah!?
 
**Muryan:**
Ah&ndash;I can't get enough of this feeling...those screams erupting from between my fingertips.
 
**Muryan:**
I mean, you really are all stupid. Can't you tell that there is no “outside”?
 
**Muryan:**
Escape to the forest and you'll be rolled right over. Run to the lake and you'll be drowned.
 
**Muryan:**
Even if you escaped to the moon&mdash;I would swallow it whole.
 
**Muryan:**
However many times you die, your “next generation” will awaken in this miniature garden.
 
**Muryan:**
I shall thoroughly exterminate you until your souls are so diminished that no more next generations are born.
 
**Muryan:**
The best course you can take is to beg me for mercy.
 
**Muryan:**
If you're lucky, I might just indulge you. Well, maybe&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
Maybe just one of you.
 
**Muryan:**
Now then, my itsy-bitsy Fang Clan...
 
**Muryan:**
The night is young. Enjoy the game you've been playing for the last thousand years, okay?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
...
 
**Muryan:**
There. There. There!
 
**Muryan:**
You can't run to the woods. You can't run anywhere. You can't, can't, CAN'T, CAN'T!
 
**Muryan:**
Get crushed! Run back to the start in disgrace and collapse in your own tears!
 
**Muryan:**
Ugh...ungh...! No resisting, no obeying, and no escape...!
 
**Muryan:**
You've killed us, all of us...! Eating us alive, limb from limb!
 
**Muryan:**
You're the guardians of Britain...! Yet you can't make anything, can't create anything!
 
**Muryan:**
You only claim to be strong because you were born that way...! Every day, you've done as you pleased!
 
**Muryan:**
And so because we were overtaking you, you started hunting us for fun!
 
**Muryan:**
Even after all this, you couldn't even be bothered with cleaning up after yourselves...
 
**Muryan:**
That's what I hate most of all...! Stinking wolves living only by their own instincts...!
 
**Muryan:**
You'll pay for this, I swear. I SWEAR...! However many years it takes, I'm going to do the same to you...!
 
**Muryan:**
There will be no discussion or reasoning, just a one-sided slaughter at my hands...!
 
**Muryan:**
I swear I'll stay alive until that day...! Even if I'm the only one standing&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
I'm going to wipe out the Fang Clan, every last one, from all of Britain...!
 
**Muryan:**
Ahaha. Ahahahaha. Ahahahahaha!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
(Whether Morgan or the Child of Prophecy wins, Britain will continue to exist...)
 
**Koyanskaya:**
(And yet...the loss of the Fang Clan will change its fate to a great degree.)
 
**Koyanskaya:**
(You should know what you're doing. You do, yet you won't turn away from foolishness.)
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I pity you, Muryan...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
How could so proper a creature as you be unable to escape your past hatreds?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
You're no better than a human...and not worthy of my services.
 
**Artoria:**
The fifth bell has been rung. One more to go in the prophecy, but...
 
**Percival:**
The bell of the Mirror Clan, correct? We've done all we can to find it.
 
**Percival:**
But I am sorry we couldn't be of any help.
 
**Oberon:**
Right. I also flew all around in search of it, but a sixth bell doesn't exist in Britain.
 
**Oberon:**
I hesitate to say that we should give up on the sixth bell...
 
**Oberon:**
Norwich proved Ainsel's prophecy wasn't so set in stone, you see?
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria's amount of magical energy is enough to cover all of the Round Table Army.
 
**Oberon:**
With Knocknarea's forces reinforcing that, the Queen's army will be no match for us.
 
**Percival:**
I suppose so...
 
**Percival:**
Now that Knocknarea has agreed to form an alliance, we cannot afford any delay.
 
**Percival:**
Let's recall the third platoon and the volunteers we left behind in Londinium.
 
**Percival:**
As soon as we meet up with them, we shall depart for Camelot.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you okay with this, Artoria?|
 
**Artoria:**
Why ask whether it's okay?
 
**Artoria:**
The Pilgrim's Bells are a sign of recognition from the clans. I don't need any from the Mirror Clan if they've died out.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now we can finally meet up with Gareth!
 
**Artoria:**
Ah, that'll be nice! I bought some souvenirs for her from Edinburgh!
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
By the way, and I know this is belated, but what exactly is a Pilgrim's Bell?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I know that the clan heads were guarding them, but are they some kind of special item?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Their sound echoes all across Britain, and Artoria gets a boost every time we ring one.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Bells are made to mark time, right? What's that got to do with a pilgrimage?
 
**Da Vinci:**
You're not wrong about being belated, Muramasa.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But I've actually been wondering about that too.
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Leaving aside the knowledge from pan-human history that bells were originally used to ward off fairies...)
 
**Da Vinci:**
Why did Ainsel use the word “pilgrimage” when there aren't any gods in Britain?
 
**Da Vinci:**
And how long have those bells existed in the first place? Until now, no fairy has been able to tell us.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm sure Morgan might have an idea...
 
**Mash:**
Um...may I cut in here?
 
**Mash:**
The Pilgrim's Bells are the transformed corpses of clan heads whose lives had expired.
 
**Mash:**
Done so in deference to the Fairy of Paradise, and in accordance with her mission to “liberate Britain”.
 
**Mash:**
In that era, the six clans abdicated their status as A-Rei brood and became fairies of the land.
 
**Mash:**
I was told it's the sound of an apology, indicating such an arrangement.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You knew that, Mash!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Right, she was with Tonelico...)
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
The sound of an apology...an apology from Britain, a pilgrimage...
 
**Artoria:**
The corpses of the clan leaders...not that of their founding fae...?
 
**Mash:**
Yes. At first, they belonged to the founder. But it seems that some were destroyed by Calamities.
 
**Mash:**
In that case, the body of the current head will become the bell. Or the last&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Percival! Where's Gareth!? Where is she!?
 
**Percival:**
Gareth wanted to protect the children of Londinium&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
I'll have Kenwood's recon unit check in with them. We'll be ready to send word to Londinium.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Commander Percival! Urgent news from the scouts!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
There's fire coming from the south! A large-scale conflagration!
 
**Percival:**
Conflagration&mdash;could it be?
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
It's Londinium! It's under attack by the Queen's forces!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Gareth:**
Morning patrol, done~! No sign of hostiles on the perimeter, yet another day of peace in Londinium~!
 
**Gareth:**
I heard the battle of Oxford ended with negotiations.
 
**Gareth:**
I wonder if the Round Table Army folks are having a merry time at that restaurant city right about now? I bet their menu have all kinds of stuff~!
 
**Gareth:**
Hm? What's all that noise? Something in the fortress&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
&mdash;Why? Why does everyone have their swords out? Why are everyone fighting?
 
**Rebel Soldier A:**
There she is, that fairy! The one who was with the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Rebel Soldier B:**
Is she alone? Good, let's kill her now! She's part of the filthy Round Table Army anyway.
 
**Gareth:**
E&mdash;ehh? Wait&mdash;what do you mean?
 
**Gareth:**
Why are the rebels attacking Londinium...?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Gareth:**
Haa, haa&mdash;I did it...I killed them, but&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
The castle! Londinium is under attack! No time to think, I need to hurry...!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Why...do this...weren't we...comrades...in arms&mdash;
 
**Rebel Soldier:**
Hah, who're you calling your comrade, you fool! A shabby army of beggars, aren't you!?
 
**Rebel Soldier:**
The third platoon is a medical unit. We're the ones with combat training. They're no match for us!
 
**Rebel Soldier:**
Don't let anyone in Londinium escape!
 
**Rebel Soldier:**
Same goes for women and children! Our Britain has no need of these defects!
 
**Rebel Soldier:**
Know your place, you misfits!
 
**Rebel Soldier:**
What Percival will witness when he returns won't be hope, but despair!
 
**Gareth:**
You&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
You're all&mdash;!
 
**Londinium Girl:**
...Grandma, Grandma...! Shem, she's been killed!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Quiet! Be quiet! Hide here, Samaria! Help's on its way...!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Uuuu...ugh...! Damn it all, she protected me and...!
 
**Londinium Girl:**
Shem, where are the others!? Where's Yuri? Where's Odd? Where's Camry?
 
**Londinium Girl:**
Are they alright? Is everyone alright!?
 
**Londinium Boy:**
...O-of course they're alright. I'm sure they escaped the castle.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Everyone's fine&mdash;they're just fine. Uugh... so we need to hide too...!
 
**Soldier's Voice A:**
One, two, three...hey, the numbers aren't adding up here. Weren't there five kids?
 
**Soldier's Voice A:**
Two left. They should be here somewhere. Find them, we can't afford to leave any witnesses.
 
**Soldier's Voice A:**
The hearth's gone out...go take a look inside.
 
**Soldier's Voice B:**
What are you talking about? It's already hot enough just being beside it, you know? I'll get baked if I go inside.
 
**Soldier's Voice B:**
What sort of fool would hide in there?
 
**Soldier's Voice A:**
That's precisely why. These beggars aren't exactly smart. They'll do anything once cornered.
 
**Soldier's Voice A:**
Whatever, I'll take a look...now then, let's see what inside...
 
**Londinium Boy:**
...! (Someone, help us...!)
 
**Soldier's Voice B:**
Guh!?
 
**Soldier's Voice A:**
Did you drop your sword? What the hell is happ&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
Aaaaaaaaaa!
 
**Gareth:**
Shem, Samaria, are you alright!? Where are you? Answer me if you're still alive!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
It's Gareth! We're saved, Samaria. Gareth is here!
 
**Londinium Girl:**
Ah! (cough)...you're right, it's the Knight!
 
**Londinium Girl:**
Did she beat them all alone? Amazing, she's amazing!
 
**Gareth:**
Thank goodness you're both safe&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
(No, they're not safe. These are terrible burns... they won't last unless I get them treated quickly...)
 
**Gareth:**
We need to hurry outside&mdash;no, we can't use the gates anymore.
 
**Gareth:**
Let's head to the operations room! We'll be safe there, and there should be some medicine as well!
 
**Gareth:**
Percival and the others will be here soon! We'll hunker down there until they get here!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
R-right...! Thank you. Thank you, Miss Gareth!
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Let's go, Samaria. Don't slow her down, okay!?
 
**Londinium Girl:**
Yeah, I'll be fine! I mean, everyone's alright after all!
 
**Gareth:**
...
 
**Gareth:**
I'm going to break through, follow me!
 
**B：Rebel Soldier A:**
Wah! So there were still fairies here! Over here, rally the men! Surround them and finish them off!
 
**B：Rebel Soldier A:**
Guh&mdash;!?
 
**C：Rebel Soldier B:**
Hey, this one's strong! Why is one of their main fighters still here!?
 
**D：Rebel Soldier C:**
I know her, she's Gareth the half-hearted!
 
**D：Rebel Soldier C:**
She's the coward who couldn't follow the Child of Prophecy and came back to Londinium!
 
**D：Rebel Soldier C:**
She'll throw in the towel soon enough, she's no match for us if we surround her, guh!?
 
**Gareth:**
You're the real cowards here! The cowards who used an ambush to kill everyone!
 
**Gareth:**
It doesn't matter how many of you there are, you're no match for me! You better run with your tails tucked between your legs if you want to live&mdash;
 
**???:**
...
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Soldier's Voice:**
Kill them all! They have sinned by shunning the mercy of the exalted one!
 
**Soldier's Voice:**
To hell with “coexistence between humans and fairies”! They're slaves with herd mentality to the very end!
 
**Knight's Voice:**
Looks like it's mostly over...
 
**Knight's Voice:**
Even Woodwose couldn't take Londinium, but it's still vulnerable from the inside.
 
**Knight's Voice:**
They'll easily trust 'humans'. A fitting end for a bunch of fools.
 
**Knight's Voice:**
Rejects like them have no need of a home. Burn it down.
 
**Knight's Voice:**
If Londinium goes, the Round Table Army's footing and the Child of Prophecy's reputation goes with it.
 
**Knight's Voice:**
Make sure you thoroughly destroy the operations room. Show that impertinent Percival his place.
 
**Gareth:**
...H...uh...I...why can't I...
 
**Gareth:**
...open my...right eye...that's...strange&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
What happened to...the city?
 
**Gareth:**
&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
Aaa&mdash;aaaaaa&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
Waa&mdash;aaaaaa&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
Again&mdash;this again&mdash;how many times, how many times must I see&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
Ehh, but&mdash;I've seen this many times? This scenery, many times&mdash;ahh.
 
**Gareth:**
...I see. That's right...I understand now&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
The Mirror Clan, right?
 
**Gareth:**
Ainsel, who tried to protect everyone from a future of ruin&mdash;failed to save anyone in the end&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Mira...even though you took the fall for me...
 
**Gareth:**
Once again, I've&mdash;
 
**Soldier's Voice:**
Hey, there's supposed to be more kids, right? Where did they go?
 
**Soldier's Voice:**
Find them, there will be no exceptions! The Round Table Army will be back soon, find the kids and kill them before then!
 
**Gareth:**
Not yet...They're still alive.
 
**Gareth:**
Come on, I gotta pick myself up...! I have to protect Shem and Samaria...!
 
**Gareth:**
But you see, Mira...I'm glad I was reborn into a next generation.
 
**Gareth:**
These days at Londinium were utopian. It was a dreamlike world.
 
**Gareth:**
Everyone helped one another, acknowledged one another, and forgave one another.
 
**Gareth:**
Treasuring themselves and treasuring those around them, that's the sort of people they were.
 
**Gareth:**
And that...for Fujimaru, was a matter of fact.
 
**Gareth:**
And so will it be for our Britain.
 
**Gareth:**
Hehe...I wonder if a world like that will come to pass? I wonder if a fairy with such a future will appear?
 
**Gareth:**
I loved watching Fujimaru. There was so much happiness in that world&mdash;
 
**Gareth:**
There didn't seem to be any cruel premonitions where “it ends here, no matter what you do”.
 
**Gareth:**
It sounds nice...we never had something like that, did we?
 
**Gareth:**
I knew what I had to protect. That I had to guide the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Gareth:**
But...I didn't want to lose everything else for that reason alone.
 
**Gareth:**
I didn't want the others in my clan to die.
 
**Gareth:**
Gareth the blockhead. Ainsel the blockhead.
 
**Gareth:**
Even though I can see the future, why can't I accept it?
 
**Gareth:**
As if...there is no 'why', is there?
 
**Gareth:**
Haa...haa...
 
**Knight:**
The operations room is above us. You set up the oil barrels, right? Let's blow it to smithereens.
 
**Gareth:**
That's far enough, Queen's army! I won't let you go any further!
 
**Knight:**
&mdash;So there was a survivor. Already faint of breath, not even worth fighting, but...
 
**Knight:**
She's still got enough in her to make a run for it alone. That outfit, are you playing at being a knight?
 
**Knight:**
You're an eyesore. Die here. The likes of Percival's soldiers shouldn't speak of being knights.
 
**Gareth:**
Shut up...! What makes the likes of you knights...!
 
**Gareth:**
I am Gareth! Knight of the Round Table Army, Gareth!
 
**Gareth:**
The first vassal of the hardworking Child of Prophecy, and first apprentice of the renowned Percival!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Gareth:**
Haa...haa...! I'm...I'm not done yet...!
 
**Knight A:**
Damn it, what a stubborn one! Is she invincible or something!?
 
**Knight B:**
Leave her be! She'll die soon enough anyway! If we drag this out, the Round Table Army will arrive! Fall back!
 
**Knight A:**
Tch...damn it, damn it all!
 
**Gareth:**
Haa...haa, aaa...I did it...I did it...
 
**Gareth:**
Now, now...I just have to wait for Percival&mdash;
 
**Knight's Words:**
“You set up the oil barrels, right? Let's blow it to smithereens&mdash;”
 
**Gareth:**
Haa...haa...up we go!
 
**Gareth:**
I just have to hold out a little longer...
 
**Gareth:**
After all, I'm a knight of Londinium. I need to protect everyone's home.
 
**Gareth:**
Haa...haa...ack...! Aaa...haa...aaa...
 
**Gareth:**
Ahh...they really set...some kinda bomb. What were they even thinking?
 
**Gareth:**
Is this the fuse? But...it'll be bad if the fire spreads...
 
**Gareth:**
Heave-ho!
 
**Gareth:**
Wow. Amazing. Ahh, I hit those guys running away. I did it!
 
**Gareth:**
Ahh, ouch ouch ouch...Sure enough, I really can't move anymore.
 
**Gareth:**
But it should be safe here...the fire isn't that intense either...
 
**Gareth:**
Ahh...the bell is ringing...
 
**Gareth:**
They're back! You did it, Artoria!
 
**Gareth:**
Thank goodness...next up is, next up is&mdash;that's right.
 
**Gareth:**
In the end, the prophecy is going to hold true. But how strange, I'm not sad this time.
 
**Gareth:**
Don't you lose, Artoria...and...
 
**Gareth:**
I'm sorry, everyone. Even after you gave me such fine armor.
 
**Londinium Boy:**
What are you apologizing for? We're all grateful.
 
**Gareth:**
&mdash;
 
**Londinium Boy:**
Hehe. Thank you for saving us even at the very end! You were amazing, Miss Gareth!
 
**Gareth:**
I know, right? I won't lose to the bad guys! After all, I am a Knight of the Round Table.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
~Evening~
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
The fire has been extinguished... Let's carry the bodies out.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Take the fairy corpses to Britain's hill...and the human ones to the communal cemetery.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Once we're done, we'll determine the extent of the damage and inform the commander. This may be difficult for you all, but I'm counting on you.
 
**Habetrot:**
No survivors, huh? Everyone, even the children...
 
**Red Rabbit:**
...
 
**Mash:**
We should remain on standby here. We shouldn't get in their way...
 
**Da Vinci:**
I suppose you're right... I have no words for the Round Table Army folks...
 
**Da Vinci:**
They were the ones who spent those days together. They'll be in mourning for that much longer.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Artoria's upstairs. She took Gareth's body with her up to the bell tower.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Speaking of which...Londinium also has a bell tower.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Damn it...it's almost like she knew things would turn out like this.
 
**Percival:**
Gareth...is this where you made your last stand...?
 
**Percival:**
But...that gash in your helmet...
 
**Percival:**
...
 
**Percival:**
My apologies...I didn't realize you were there, Fujimaru.
 
**Percival:**
I apologize for making you worry. Please don't mind me, I'm used to this.
 
**Percival:**
I've buried Gareth's armor along with the children.
 
**Percival:**
But, I've taken her spear...with my own hands, I will send it to where it belongs.
 
**Artoria:**
You did your best all on your own...but...
 
**Artoria:**
(I really can't do it, Gareth. Because I know why they attacked Londinium.)
 
**Artoria:**
(I don't value this world at all. And unlike you, I don't have something I want to protect&mdash;)
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, Fujimaru, you came here too? Are you here to console me?
 
**Artoria:**
Thank you, but there's no need for you to worry, though, I was prepared for this.
 
**Artoria:**
But, I'd like to ring the bell alone. I don't want you to see this unsightly side of me.
 
**Oberon:**
At last, the sixth bell has been rung... You did well, Artoria.
 
**Oberon:**
The round fortress shall burn out...The bell of the waters shall be revealed, huh?
 
**Oberon:**
Hello there and welcome back, Blanca. How's the situation with Knocknarea and Camelot looking?
 
**Oberon:**
Hmm, they're both gearing up for war. The only Fairy Knights who answered the call are Barghest and Lancelot.
 
**Oberon:**
Baobhan Sith has been removed from the line of succession and is currently under house arrest at Camelot?
 
**Oberon:**
Oh I see, so it's because she took the Garden of Dejection. As expected, she must have angered Morgan.
 
**Oberon:**
Spriggan heads for Camelot. Muryan remains in Gloucester.
 
**Oberon:**
Aurora has rallied the volunteer forces in Salisbury and plans a late rendezvous with the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Oberon:**
No movement from the Mors. So this is what you'd call 'the calm before the storm'.
 
**Oberon:**
Hmm? You don't look too well. That fluffy coat of yours has gotten coarse.
 
**Oberon:**
Did you push yourself too hard? Sure, come and get some rest.
 
**Oberon:**
From this point forward, I won't have the luxury of watching the situation. Morgan and Artoria&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
It'll be a decisive battle that determines which one of the two 'Fairies of Paradise' survive.
 
**Oberon:**
If we can topple Morgan, then that'll conclude this story. As long as it means victory, they can fall together.
 
**Oberon:**
As a matter of fact, Artoria's survival is not essential to the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Oberon:**
Ainsel left behind a foreboding line too. That was truly mean of her. What was she even wary of?
 
**Oberon:**
Nevertheless&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
As far as pan-human history is concerned, it is enough that Fujimaru survives.
 
**Oberon:**
The curtains will shortly fall on the tale of the Fairy Kingdom. I suppose you could say that we're finally at the climax.
 
## Section 23: The Night Before the Final Battle (II) 
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
It is my great honor to present my report to Her Majesty Queen Morgan.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Fairy Knight Barghest and Fairy Knight Lancelot have both been stationed upon Camelot's ramparts.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Lady Aurora, head of the Wind Clan, has departed Salisbury with her army in tow.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
They will arrive at the West Gate of Camelot by tomorrow.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Lord Spriggan, head of the Earth Clan, has already entered the castle alongside his entourage.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Lady Muryan, head of the Wing Clan, has refused to answer the call. She stands in favor of the Child of Prophecy and has made clear her rebellion.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Of the 105 knights under Her Majesty's direct control, stationed in various locations, 80 have returned to Camelot.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
25 have refused to answer the call and are holding fast in their domains.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(The knights aren't convening...?) (To think there would be defectors among the Queen's army...)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(...Camelot's at a disadvantage if it's a matter of number of troops...) (...the Pilgrim's Bells have all been rung, as well...)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(...They say the Child of Prophecy now possesses magical energy on par with Her Majesty...)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(...They also say the Foreign Magus uses apparitions that rival our knights...)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(...What do we do? What do we do? How about we just...)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(...No. There's nothing to fear. We have the Fairy Knights here.)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(...Sure, she may have lost, but Barghest's strength hasn't diminished...as long as she's here, they'll never break through the main gate...)
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Hmph. So Aurora will be arriving late. How very like her.
 
**Morgan:**
Inform Barghest that the West Gate need not be opened.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
But then...
 
**Morgan:**
I said there is no need to let Aurora in. Do not make me repeat myself.
 
**Fairy Official:**
Your Highness, what of the knights who have refused to answer the call?
 
**Fairy Official:**
If you are to punish them for treason, we shall head out to confiscate their lands...
 
**Morgan:**
That won't be necessary. I have personally delivered the knights who refused to answer the call to justice.
 
**Morgan:**
The very act of weighing the Child of Prophecy against me is a blasphemy worthy of death.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(All those knights, all over the land, in a single night!? How did she manage that!?)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Even if they aren't as good as the Fairy Knights, the Queen's knights are still peerless warriors! And she did it alone!?)
 
**Morgan:**
Silence, you incompetents.
 
**Morgan:**
I did not summon the knights for their strength. All I did was offer them a chance to prove their loyalty.
 
**Morgan:**
Camelot shall not fall, no matter what. Not to the likes of rebels, or&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
They are no more troublesome than the eighth Calamity. I alone will suffice.
 
**Morgan:**
“Child of Prophecy”...how pitiful, Just because you rang all the Pilgrim's Bells...
 
**Morgan:**
How many times did you think I accomplished the same? You won't measure up to even an ounce of my power with just a single pilgrimage.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(What the...!? Does Her Majesty mean to say she too, went on a pilgrimage!?)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Were the rumors true after all...? That Queen Morgan is a “Fairy of Paradise”...?)
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Your Highness, please forgive our insolence.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
However, just now there was a response from Lady Knocknarea's mirror, of the King's Clan. Do you wish to authorize it?
 
**Morgan:**
Very well. Project it.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
As you wish! Void Mirror, over here!
 
**Knocknarea:**
How fares your day, Queen Morgan? This is Knocknarea, scion of the northern fairies.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Firstly, in regards to your request the other day, do allow me to apologize.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I was ordered to execute the Child of Prophecy. However, that unfortunately did not come to pass.
 
**Knocknarea:**
After a fair duel, the Child of Prophecy and I have become the closest of friends.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I do apologize for not being able to answer Her Majesty's expectations.
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;Well, it's not like you trust anyone, so I doubt you had any expectations from the beginning.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(That brat, what an attitude to take against Her Highness...!) (Do those northern savages have neither fear nor respect!?)
 
**Knocknarea:**
Also, allow me to extend my congratulations. Please rejoice, Queen Morgan.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The time has come for you to be freed from your age-old rule of Britain, and the burden of your duties.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The exploitation of life through Command Spells. The government's inaction against the Great Calamity.
 
**Knocknarea:**
So long as that throne is yours to sit on, Britain has no future.
 
**Knocknarea:**
And most importantly&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
I possess the right to rule, as inherited from Queen Mab.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The time for abdication has come, Morgan. I cannot entrust you with Britain.
 
**Knocknarea:**
In the name of Knocknarea, I grant the current sovereign of Camelot the right to surrender.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Relinquish the castle by daybreak tomorrow. If you cannot accept these terms&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
I shall seize the throne by force. As such, the treaty between you and the former queen ends here.
 
**Knocknarea:**
En garde, Morgan le Fae.
 
**Knocknarea:**
This is a declaration of war towards you, from the Child of the Queen and the Child of Prophecy!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 

 ~A day and a half after the attack on Londinium~
 

 ~Day 44 in Britain, evening~
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;And that brings the proclamation to a close! Now we have all the justification we need!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Once the Round Table Army arrives, we declare war?|
 
**Knocknarea:**
No objections here. We're prepared to receive them. All that's left is to spend the night building our formations.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Isn't the war declaration and offer to surrender reversed?
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah...normally, war begins with a declaration, and you ask for surrender when your enemy is weak...
 
**Knocknarea:**
But Morgan's not going to surrender anyway! I'll carry out my duty while I still can!
 

---

 
**Percival:**
The battle will commence tomorrow morning, no matter what...
 
**Percival:**
Aside from reorganizing each army, how should we arrange for the attack on the castle?
 
**Percival:**
The Queen's army doesn't seem likely to deploy on the plains...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, they're all holed up inside the castle. They haven't sent any troops out into the field.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Thanks to that, the Round Table Army in Oxford were able to arrive today.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Do we head straight for the castle, then? Where are we breaking through, the main gate or the east and west gates respectively?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
We only need to break through the front. That's what Knocknarea's Giant Corps was made for.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
They'll break through a single point at the main gate, and then the northern fairy army and the Round Table Army will wrest control of the castle town.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
If it were me, I'd put off taking the town until after the castle has fallen, but...
 
**Knocknarea:**
I told you we're not doing that. I want that castle spotless when it becomes mine!
 
**Knocknarea:**
The throne especially must remain unharmed...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Even supposing we do defeat Morgan, if the throne is destroyed then there's no point.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Does the throne have some special significance?|
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Mm, nope! But it's mine (expected), so that means it's special!
 
**Artoria:**
You're acting like you already won...you're so hasty. Don't trip over your own feet crossing the finish line, okay?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Why don't you worry less about me and more about yourself?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Setting aside taking over the castle town, you'll have the hardest job of entering the castle.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Morgan will focus on killing Artoria and Fujimaru first and foremost.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If either of you fall, Ainsel's prophecy will no longer be certain.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If that happens, the Round Table Army's morale will plummet. My northern army will be the only survivors.
 
**Percival:**
That's...true.
 
**Percival:**
Should we have Artoria and Fujimaru stand by in the rear lines then?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
We can't have that. Without the Fairy of Paradise's divine blessing, the main gate won't fall.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
If nothing else, there's the Fairy Knights, Lancelot and Barghest.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Without Fujimaru, Artoria, and Mash, we won't be able to compete with those two.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You guys will be fighting on the front lines continuously. First the gate, then the city, and finally the castle. Got it?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
... (Nod)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
... (Again, about that throne...)
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
What is it, Knocknarea? You're breathing rather heavily.
 
**Artoria:**
If you have something to say, now's the time, you know? We probably won't have any free time from now until tomorrow.
 
**Artoria:**
If you don't say something sweet in advance, you'll miss the chance to prove you're more than just a chocolate queen.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Don't tell me what to do! You know my vow, don't you!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
It's fine now! Once Morgan is defeated and I've gotten the throne, I'll go for a quick win!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Hmph. I don't have anything special I want to say. Everything comes down to my courage tomorrow.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Watch me instead of Artoria, Fujimaru.
 
**Knocknarea:**
See for yourself which fairy is more suited to rule Britain.
 
**Artoria:**
You're getting too full of yourself, Knocknarea. You sure do like to shoot for the stars.
 
**Artoria:**
Just don't slip and fall to your death after the battle, or go down in fairy history for some other dumb reason.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Like hell I'd die from something so careless! I mean, I'm immortal so long as there's a northern army in the first place!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Sheesh. I thought you'd be grumpier when you joined up with the Round Table Army.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You're even more fired up than you were before. Rivals and friends are the best treat of all, huh?
 
**Knocknarea:**
I guess. Neither one of them are mine yet, but the more rewards on the line, the hotter I burn.
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;And that's why we have to be careful when it comes to our war councils.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Child of Prophecy, Artoria. Commander of the Round Table Army, Percival.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Magus advisor to the northern army, Grimm. Sage of the outside world, Da Vinci.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I ask the four of you to remain here. Muramasa and Fujimaru are dismissed.
 
**Knocknarea:**
We've set up tents in the campsite, so take care to rest up in preparation for tomorrow.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You want me too? Well, as someone on the side of pan-human history—on the side of Chaldea—I can at least offer my opinions.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Don't worry about me. Go ahead and get some rest, Fujimaru.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, I'll give you a summary of what we discuss later. Say hi to Mash for me.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it. I'll let Oberon know too.|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Artoria, will you be okay on your own?
 
**Artoria:**
Don't worry. Knocknarea may be in charge, but if she gets carried away I'll rein her in immediately.
 
**Artoria:**
Percival's here too, so I think we can plan out strategies that work for both armies.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Welcome back, Master. How did the joint planning session with the northern army and the Round Table Army go?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, to summarize...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Knocknarea suddenly declared war...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I see. So Knocknarea asserted that this is a battle between countries.
 
**Mash:**
The rough plan for the attack on the castle has been decided, and now they're working on the details... is that what's happening?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Tomorrow morning, it's war.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Our objective is to obtain Rhongomyniad...and to prevent the “collapse” from spreading beyond Britain's lostbelt.
 
**Mash:**
As long as those two objectives are only fulfilled by defeating Morgan, this battle is unavoidable, but...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can you fight Morgan, Mash...?|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I'd like it if we could settle everything through discussion...but...
 
**Mash:**
Queen Morgan has ruled over Britain in the way she believes right for the past 2,000 years.
 
**Mash:**
That sort of justice and belief can't be shaken with mere words. Most of all, Morgan doesn't want that sort of thing.
 
**Mash:**
She would only yield her convictions if she were defeated by something greater than herself.
 
**Mash:**
To grant your desires...your wishes, show your utmost conviction.
 
**Mash:**
That's the way the savior Tonelico I saw ought to be, strict yet gentle.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I guess she knew Tonelico...)
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...And you, Senpai?
 
**Mash:**
This battle will surely determine the fate of Britain, but...
 
**Mash:**
It's been 44 days since we left the Storm Border. We're approaching our time limit for the operation.
 
**Mash:**
If we can investigate Camelot, our mission will be accomplished, but this battle is definitely not something we need to take part in.
 
**Mash:**
We could take advantage of the confusion during the battle to sneak into Camelot and obtain Rhongomyniad...
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure Holmes would suggest a plan like that...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;No. I'm fighting.|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I promised Artoria I'd help.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I decided that myself.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
That's right...Simply running away was never a choice.
 
**Mash:**
It's our duty as ones who have seen the death of many Lostbelts, and as people from pan-human history.
 
**Mash:**
Our hopes as comrades of the Child of Prophecy have journeyed so far.
 
**Mash:**
Let's take on Queen Morgan with those things in mind. For the future of this beautiful Britain.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Hey there. Out for a walk by yourself, Fujimaru?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The strategy meeting just came to an end. Now we just have to wait for tomorrow morning.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You and Mash are the vital members of the breakthrough party, so make sure you drive the castle layout into your brain before you get to sleep.
 
**Habetrot:**
Here you go, a map from Knocknarea. It's a rough layout of the castle town in Camelot.
 
**Habetrot:**
Back then we were only there for an audience, but the buildings there are pretty tall.
 
**Habetrot:**
You go down one wrong street and you'll be lost, so be careful. I won't be there to help you this time.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aren't you going to fight, Habetrot?|
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
The, uh...what was it? Storm Border? I'll stay there until you guys come back.
 
**Habetrot:**
But I won't fight Morgan. I'll have to hang back and see how the events here play out.
 
**Habetrot:**
However...
 
**Habetrot:**
If you're going to fight, I want you to confront her head-on. That way she can't make any excuses.
 
**Habetrot:**
She's a queen who hates to lose. If you don't do that much, she won't let herself yield.
 
**Habetrot:**
What about you, Grimm? You gonna go to war with them?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I guess. To be honest, it doesn't really matter to me who wins, but I'll keep Artoria safe.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
My mission is to make sure the Fairies of Paradise fulfill their obligations.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Even if Artoria can't beat Morgan, as long as she stays alive then she can pull through.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria will win.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The prophecy says she'll become the true king.
 

---

 
**Habetrot:**
Yeah, that's what Ainsel said, wasn't it?
 
**Habetrot:**
“Guided by the Staff of Selection, watched over by the foreign traveller, the child of salvation will reach the throne.”
 
**Habetrot:**
“The true king takes their place on the throne. A bloodstained crown presented.”
 
**Habetrot:**
“Let the six bells toll in demonstration. Make way for the true king.”
 
**Habetrot:**
So far it's played out exactly as stated.
 
**Habetrot:**
The six bells have rung, the foreign traveller is watching, and the throne will finally be in reach tomorrow.
 
**Habetrot:**
As far as I can tell, Artoria and Morgan's Saint Graphs are equally matched.
 
**Habetrot:**
They have differences in the company they keep, but that's about even too. All that's left is to do their best tomorrow...still...
 
**Habetrot:**
That part about the “bloodstained crown” is in pretty poor taste...it's talking about a crown soaked in Morgan's blood.
 
**Habetrot:**
Proposing that's how the Child of Prophecy wins... damned Ainsel, surely you could have put it better.
 
**Habetrot:**
Well, I guess Morgan has been doing as much to Britain though...
 
**Habetrot:**
...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Oh, right. Fujimaru, can you bring Percival a message for me?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I'm carving runes into the shields of the Round Table Army's soldiers too, but even I have my limits.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Ask him to gather a hundred of his best men. He should be in the officer's tent.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Be nice to Habetrot, now.
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Hey, I've known her since the first Grimm! I'll keep an eye on her, make sure she doesn't do anything crazy!
 
**Percival:**
...
 
**Narration:**
Love is an inexplicable thing in this world.
 
**Narration:**
Poets sing that love is fate itself. That it is joy. That it is death.
 
**Narration:**
Those without love are happy in a way, and those with are unhappy in a way.
 
**Narration:**
When I was a child, I didn't know what that meant.
 
**Narration:**
I believed that love was simple, that loving and being loved were all it took to be happy.
 
**Narration:**
The place I was brought to after being bought from the farm was a lush, verdant city.
 
**Narration:**
I lived without hardship in an educational facility alongside other children, purchased much like myself.
 
**Narration:**
The facility was built at the suggestion of a fairy.
 
**Narration:**
“Well, why don't we raise one personally?”
 
**Narration:**
A school not to raise fairy knights, but human ones.
 
**Narration:**
The one appointed its director...was the head of the Fang Clan.
 
**Narration:**
He only appeared a few times, but each time he said to the children:
 
**Narration:**
“We bought all the children born that year. There are no longer any other candidates.”
 
**Narration:**
“If you show no aptitude by the time you come of age, this plan will have failed. Your days may be taxing, but I'm counting on you.”
 
**Narration:**
The head of the Fang Clan may have been rough in nature, but he was neither cruel nor inhumane.
 
**Narration:**
“Why did I get into the restaurant business? Hrm. Well, I suppose I can tell you.”
 
**Narration:**
“We of the Fang Clan are prone to savagery. Once our tempers flare, quenching them is difficult.”
 
**Narration:**
“Because of that, we once committed a grave sin. An entire clan was destroyed for trivial reasons.”
 
**Narration:**
“The Fang Clan require manners. They must also regulate their tastes. A vegetable diet is better than a meat one.”
 
**Narration:**
“However, that was not a sin that can be atoned for... I would at least like to attempt to avoid repeating our mistakes.”
 
**Narration:**
Although we didn't respect him, because he too was suffering due to his own karma, neither did we hate him.
 
**Narration:**
The days of training continued.
 
**Narration:**
One by one, children dropped out and were taken as slaves by other fairies.
 
**Narration:**
I stayed behind since I was blessed with a strong physique. And then...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Yes. See how hot your left arm is now? That's a magic circuit. Your special talent, Percival.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Even humans can generate magical energy. After that, it all comes down to how you use it. Just try to copy me.
 
**Narration:**
Then came the Knight of the Lake, the strongest and most gentle in all of Britain.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You don't have to rush. I'm here for you, Percival.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Woodwose won't be coming anymore. His project is done.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
So take your time. Grow up slowly.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Don't be rash. Don't get hurt or anything else. And don't get into any funny business I don't know about.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
My first student. My first child. My first little brother. My first friend.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
My&mdash;treasured Percival. Please, be sure to grow up strong.
 
**Narration:**
Back then, that was the “love” I knew.
 
**Narration:**
I was content to just be loved.
 
**Narration:**
I was more than happy to live up to those expectations.
 
**Narration:**
But...as I grew older, I came to see a little more of the world.
 
**Narration:**
Little by little, I came to see things my child self hadn't.
 
**Fairy:**
Ooh, listen to this, Mélusine...! It's awful, just simply awful...!
 
**Fairy:**
Bones and the others do nothing but harass us, even though everybody worked so hard for the manor...
 
**Fairy:**
Their own manor is doing so well, so I can see why they're so confident, but...
 
**Fairy:**
It's nothing but baseless slander...and now he's even harassing the humans who work in the manor...
 
**Fairy:**
I'm worried...Bones and his friends are thugs, aren't they? If they were to do something...
 
**Fairy:**
Aah, I feel like I'll break apart just thinking about it... are my wings still sparkling?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Of course...don't worry. I'll take care of all your problems.
 
**Narration:**
The love that I knew, what was directed at me, was not love at all.
 
**Narration:**
That was charity.
 
**Narration:**
Love was fate, joy, and death. It was a curse that you couldn't do anything about.
 
**Narration:**
It was a mistake. I knew it was all a mistake.
 
**Narration:**
Love obscures your better judgement. It turns wise men into fools. Good men into villains.
 
**Narration:**
Something beautiful will lose its form.
 
**Narration:**
You know you're just being used, but you depend on that love.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;The happiness that was originally promised. Even the future that was suitable for her was stolen away.
 
**Mélusine:**
Uuh...uuu..aah...aah...
 
**Mélusine:**
aaah...aaaah...!
 
**Narration:**
That day, I heard the wails and felt as if my soul was cracking apart.
 
**Narration:**
It was the night I broke the rules and headed to the cathedral to convey the news that I had been granted the Spear of Selection.
 
**Narration:**
There, I saw her despair over her own foolishness.
 
**Narration:**
I couldn't call out to her or help her. I was only a ten-year-old boy.
 
**Narration:**
That was why I thought so hard about growing up as fast as I could.
 
**Narration:**
I'd understand when I grew up. I'd be able to break that awful curse.
 
**Percival as a Young Boy:**
&mdash;That's it. I'm going to save her.
 
**Narration:**
I may be the commander of the Round Table Army, but I'm not that great a person. The only way to free her is to defeat the Queen.
 
**Narration:**
I was never of a mind to go to war for Britain's sake.
 
**Narration:**
I only had one wish. No matter how selfish that love was, that was all.
 
**Percival:**
&mdash;I understand, Gareth. My childish selfishness is over.
 
**Percival:**
Your spear will definitely reach them. For the sake of your wish to protect Britain.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry for disturbing you.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Percival, are you in here?
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Oh, what is it, Fujimaru? Is there something you need from me?
 
**Percival:**
From Grimm? A hundred of our best? I see.
 
**Percival:**
I'll start talking to them right away. Thanks for your trouble.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you okay...?
 

---

 
**Percival:**
You saw through my lack of enthusiasm, huh... you're right, I was scolded for not concentrating on the meeting earlier as well.
 
**Percival:**
But I've already sorted through it. I've decided on what I need to do.
 
**Percival:**
In this moment, I am Percival of the Round Table Army. I have a treasured objective and a treasured wish.
 
**Percival:**
Right now, I only fight for what should be. Please let Artoria know that too.
 
**Percival:**
I'm sure she would be able to see right through me, either way...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I see...Percival is still...)
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Tomorrow is the decisive battle with Her Majesty. We'll inevitably have a confrontation with Fairy Knight Lancelot.
 
**Percival:**
As Knight Commander of the Round Table Army, please leave her to me.
 
**Percival:**
Even should I lose&mdash;I'll keep her occupied until the battle is over.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that what you want, Percival...?|
 

---

 
**Percival:**
It is. The central figures in this war are Artoria and Knocknarea. The prophecy doesn't even mention me.
 
**Percival:**
In the end, I'm just a child who never understood love...
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just the two of you?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where's Artoria?
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Artoria was here a while ago. She went outside the encampment to get some air.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It'd be rash to act alone while in front of the enemy lines. But, Artoria would have no problems holding off a Fairy Knight the way she is now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's still a concern why she had to go all the way out there. I guess she's tired of being in so big a group.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, come now, she's just not so good with crowds, is she?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Kind of like how I'm not good with fairies. Humans here don't seem great with them either.
 
？1,1050,saveMaterial：You think so?
 
？2,2050,saveMaterial：Because Artoria can see through other people's lies...?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Is that how she appears to you, Muramasa? True, she seems a little uncomfortable.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I just try not to mind other people's business more than my own. It beats acting stuck-up.
 
**Da Vinci:**
After all, and this stays between us, isn't Artoria really dangerous at this point? She's on the level of a Lostbelt King.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If she turned to evil in a fit of rage, don't you think we'd all be destroyed?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Should that ever happen, I'll make Muramasa into a decoy while the rest of us hightail it. Have fun!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We'll go to the other side together if that happens. Don't expect a boost across the Sanzu from me, got it?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm? Can she see through other's lies?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That'd be Fairy Eyes, I suppose...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
“By nature, fairies cannot be lied to. It's a result of them actually seeing emotions.”
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That's how Muryan put it. Though, she herself seemed to have a bit of that power in her.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hold on. Ever since they started mimicking human culture...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oberon said that the Mystery of Fairy Eyes abated in Britain's fairies.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I get it, Artoria isn't a fairy native to Britain. She's from Avalon, so&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
She sees lies, and knows other people's true feelings. Or maybe things even more essential than that.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The nature of evil, causality, and karma. I've spent my own life pondering such things.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Being able to see karma has a terrible—no, a miserable lot in life.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The reason for fairies disappearing from pan-human history may be attributed to the development of civilization.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But in fact, it's gotta be because human malice is so unbearable to watch.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We invent languages, start learning, and spread knowledge from the upper to lower classes.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That's how humans gain wisdom. At the same time, we gained powers of deception through words, speaking falsely, hiding our true intentions.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The fairies couldn't take it, so they stopped associating with humans.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
And here in this Lostbelt, fairies started to hide their intentions like humans do.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Only two sensed the ugliness in being shown lies.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Artoria and Morgan were the only ones pan-human history would consider actual fairies.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see...it's one thing to see through a lie, and another to look upon it directly.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There are times where we're fine with being fooled, even if we know it's a lie. We can close our eyes in order to make the conversation go smoothly.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But those with Fairy Eyes can't close them off. They have no choice but to be confronted by the lie and our true intent.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If you only stuck with honest people...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If lies were forbidden...
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
That still wouldn't solve the problem. Every honest person has a disparity between their words and thoughts.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's still fine to lie in order to undermine someone. You can cope with that if you know what you're doing.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But for those who can see, the hardest thing is lying out of concern for others.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if you're doing it in good faith, it's a falsehood.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So even compassion and consideration will appear corrupted to Fairy Eyes...
 
**Da Vinci:**
For the Fairies of Paradise, Britain at present is no different from human society.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Would they want to save a Britain like that...?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I think she might. The girl is pretty hardcore in that regard.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That she hasn't run away yet is the best proof of that. I can't tell what makes her so pigheaded&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But that's the kind of steel that never bends until the end! One way or another, she lives by her faith in you brats!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But you never know what life—even as a Servant—has in store for you, right?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I wanted to pay back the debt for saving my life and get back to the Alien God...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yet things went on longer than expected.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The story kept going, and going. And before I knew it, we're half a day from attacking the castle.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
And with the Master from Chaldea in tow. I wonder how that was meant to be.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'll say. It's a great situation, if you ask me.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I included it in my reports, but I'm sure Director Gordolf is at his wit's end.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why don't you just join us?|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, that wouldn't be a bad idea!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Could you!?|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, I could. The Alien God only summoned me as a Servant to play a particular role.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
“With the eye of the strongest on you, there is no cause for discord. Therefore, you will not betray us.”
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What the right job for you is, your likes and dislikes, and all that...I don't really understand the subtleties of humanity.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It all comes down to a matter of loss or gain... that's how it used to be, at least.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, I'll leave that to the other Muramasa. The one you actually formed a connection with.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's too bad...|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah. You better treasure the way this feels, kid. These were some good talks, not having to lie or put on pretense.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The reason Artoria was able to press on this far on her journey was because you have that way about you.
 
**Artoria:**
Ahhhh, I'm so tired...
 
**Artoria:**
Do you have to issue orders to every individual soldier, Knocknarea?
 
**Artoria:**
That kind of stuff ought to be entrusted to their troop leaders.
 
**Artoria:**
Northern fairies don't think too hard, so the brainwork is best left to those who do.
 
**Artoria:**
But that's what makes them honest and uniform in personality. They're filled with loyalty to her.
 
**Artoria:**
The people of the Round Table Army have recovered. Tomorrow's battle is looking like&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
Everything will go just as the prophecy foretold. Morgan will be defeated without any sacrifices.
 
**Oberon:**
The pilgrimage went well. No companions departed the group.
 
**Oberon:**
Likewise, the rebel army is in perfect shape. Nobody is hiding anything, unlike the queen's army.
 
**Oberon:**
Everything ought to end happily ever after. Don't you agree, Artoria?
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Oberon:**
You're worried about Gareth, I guess. Her end was written in the prophecy.
 
**Oberon:**
“The round fortress shall burn out, the bell of the waters shall be revealed.”
 
**Oberon:**
It wasn't your fault that it happened, or that she left you. That's just the way it had to be.
 
**Artoria:**
Do you really think so...?
 
**Oberon:**
Of course. Gareth hardly comes to mind any other way.
 
**Artoria:**
I don't mean about Gareth. You just said “without any sacrifices.”
 
**Artoria:**
The rebel army has little chance of winning... everyone in the Round Table Army, humans in particular, will die in the battle.
 
**Artoria:**
I know this, but you're assuring me there'll be no sacrifices.
 
**Artoria:**
And also, “unlike the queen's army”.
 
**Artoria:**
You've actually known Knocknarea for a long time now, Oberon.
 
**Artoria:**
When she caught us on our way back from the royal audience, you were pretending you'd never met before.
 
**Oberon:**
Yes, well, actually...
 
**Oberon:**
You wouldn't have trusted me if you'd known I was on good terms with Knocknarea, would you?
 
**Artoria:**
Not just that, either.
 
**Artoria:**
When we saw Mash for the first time in Norwich...
 
**Fujimaru:**
That's Mash&mdash;!
 
**Oberon:**
What&mdash;!?
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
You knew about her. You knew, and pretended to see her for the first time.
 
**Artoria:**
You knew all along that Mash was in Sheffield, but kept silent.
 
**Artoria:**
Because Fujimaru would've gone there after her, so you hid it from {(M)him/(F)her} to avoid that.
 
**Oberon:**
Yes, well, actually...
 
**Oberon:**
That wouldn't have fit in with Fujimaru's mission from Chaldea.
 
**Oberon:**
I wanted {(M)him/(F)her} to support the Child of Prophecy by {(M)his/(F)her} own will.
 
**Oberon:**
I'll admit that I was dishonest.
 
**Oberon:**
Even taking into account that Mash is a powerful Fairy Knight, it was dangerous to go up north on your own.
 
**Artoria:**
And...
 
**Oberon:**
And what?
 
**Oberon:**
That's why I'm so much more invested in Britain than I probably should be, because they're here.
 
**Oberon:**
It's ridiculous to think that because they're worthless, they can't do anything. The helpless ones were the only ones to help me.
 
**Oberon:**
So I gotta return the favor☆ That's why I'm working so hard to overthrow Morgan.
 
**Artoria:**
And...you were somewhere else on the morning of the battle with Woodwose's army.
 
**Artoria:**
They didn't have any reinforcements from the Queen at the time. We might have won, but...
 
**Artoria:**
That too was the result of something you did. You come off&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
You come off as honest and sincere, but you don't tell the truth. You leave out important details from others.
 
**Artoria:**
Why is that? Why have you lied so many times?
 
**Artoria:**
Maybe you don't&mdash;you don't really want to defeat Morgan, do you?
 
**Oberon:**
&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
That isn't true at all. No other fairy has done more to oppose Morgan than I have.
 
**Oberon:**
I will devote my very being to overthrow the Fairy Kingdom, even if it means lying. And what's more—
 
**Oberon:**
You've been telling lies too, Artoria.
 
**Oberon:**
The reasons for coming all this way. I mean, your motives for saving Britain.
 
**Oberon:**
It's not just me. Fujimaru has an inkling as well.
 
**Oberon:**
You weren't fighting for the humans, or for fairies, or any reason in particular.
 
**Oberon:**
Your true feelings lie elsewhere. You just don't talk about it.
 
**Artoria:**
That's a ridiculous thing to say...
 
**Artoria:**
I'm the Fairy of Paradise, sent to save Britain.
 
**Oberon:**
That's your guilt talking. In the first place, what does Britain's salvation mean to you?
 
**Oberon:**
Muramasa told me something.
 
**Oberon:**
“All the fairies are seeking forgiveness. They all want to be destroyed.”
 
**Oberon:**
No matter what the city or who the fairy, they all have the same wish at the bottom of their hearts.
 
**Artoria:**
Muramasa said that...?
 
**Oberon:**
He doesn't have Fairy Eyes like you and I do, though. I'm sure it's just a sensitivity to heartache.
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria. That's the source of your hesitation, isn't it?
 
**Oberon:**
You don't bring up the crucial facts, because there's no reason to do so.
 
**Oberon:**
That's how it is for me. If it's necessary for bringing down Morgan, we have to do things we otherwise wouldn't.
 
**Oberon:**
Let's leave off here for now. Tomorrow's battle will finish this, once and for all.
 
**Oberon:**
I'm sure the time will come when we can both reveal the important things we've been hiding.
 
**Oberon:**
And isn't that what the pilgrimage was all about?
 
**Oberon:**
Hey, why not confide in them? They might just surprise you by laughing it off.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Barghest:**
It seems Knocknarea and the Round Table Army have already joined up.
 
**Barghest:**
There's nothing we can do to prevent their alliance... their common goal is very clear.
 
**Barghest:**
The blessings of the Child of Prophecy combined with the Fairy Territory of the King's Clan. They might stand on par with us in terms of military strength.
 
**Barghest:**
I'm sure Her Majesty intends to crush them head on, but there are scenarios where that may backfire.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
With the same number of troops, we'll come out victorious as long as you and I are present.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
In fact, that's assured if we attacked on our own. Whether the Queen's knights participate makes no difference.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I could destroy the Knocknarean force alone, and likewise, you could rout the Round Table Army.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
There's no point in waiting until morning, and no reason to meet them in a fair battle.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The Foreign Magus. Galahad. Two Servants. Percival.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's all that needs our attention. But I can settle things with them by myself.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Their abilities are satisfactory, but compatibility trumps all. Not one of them can fight in the air.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The only ones who can contend with me are Her Majesty Morgan, and you with your enlarged fairy body.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
If they were going to challenge Camelot, they should've brought double the troops.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But the Salisbury soldiers who sympathized with the rebels have just crossed over to the western plains.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The Fang Clan, which could've been a secret weapon, have disappeared. I can only imagine banished.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Their chances are overvalued. Ainsel's prophecy is averted. The rebellion ends here.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Unless...they have specimens on their side able to rival us Fairy Knights.
 
**Barghest:**
I guess you're right...they don't have any Fairy Knights.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Her Majesty has ordered us to slay only the troops who enter the castle.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I'm to do laps in the sky and pick off soldiers who try to scale the city walls.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Her Majesty's knights are stationed in the castle town, but they won't get a chance to fight.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The main gate is your domain, Barghest. Nothing will get past you.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I wish I could send them a few flowers out of sympathy, but reality is harsh.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I suppose the last battle of the Fairy Kingdom will end quietly and uneventfully.
 
**Barghest:**
The last, huh...? Sure, there won't ever be another rebellion on this scale again.
 
**Barghest:**
But the Calamities won't quit, and Her Majesty has no intention of stopping the Great Calamity.
 
**Barghest:**
The victory gained by us Fairy Knights means most every fairy in Britain will die off.
 
**Barghest:**
Don't you find that hollow? What's the purpose of even winning this battle?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I'm surprised...I thought you didn't think about things that way.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Woodwose called fighting instinctive, and that the Fang Clan took joy in struggling against powerful foes.
 
**Barghest:**
I don't deny it...I also possess the nature of a bloodthirsty beast.
 
**Barghest:**
I'm no different from Baobhan Sith in that I can't help but trample over the weak.
 
**Barghest:**
But that's my personal issue, and no concern for Britain as a whole.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I see. You became a Fairy Knight to protect Britain, didn't you?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Sorry, but I'm different. Her Majesty's gifted name is but a shackle on me.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I am a combat aircraft. Human swordplay is a bothersome distraction.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Yet I received the title of Fairy Knight because I fit the part of Lancelot.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It was about 100 years ago that my body showed signs of irregularity.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
My love for her kept me contained, but that can't last forever either.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It was Her Majesty that saved me from such a fate. Taking the name of a Fairy Knight keeps me from returning to that state.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It's not for Britain that I obey, but to maintain my form.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
So I don't quite understand what you've told me... no, I do, but I don't care to think about it.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Because I have something else that's more important to me.
 
**Barghest:**
More important to you than Britain...?
 
**Barghest:**
(I have something like that myself...Adonis... at least, until he dies of natural causes...)
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You don't have anything like that, do you? That's what I envy about you.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Her Majesty Morgan is one who knows no love, but her trust in you is steadfast.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
However many blunders you commit, she will always call upon you. I can see why Woodwose was jealous.
 
**Barghest:**
Her Majesty knows no love...?
 
**Barghest:**
No...I supposed she doesn't. Her love is focused on the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Barghest:**
I am also indebted to Her Majesty. Without the gifted name of the Fairy Knight, I wouldn't be able to exist today.
 
**Barghest:**
I possess Her Majesty's favor. Even if it's to control me, it is still an obligation.
 
**Barghest:**
But...
 
**Barghest:**
(I can accept no further rewards. Not if I want to protect Britain...and his future.)
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Night...it's night...somebody get...get me some light...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I have a ball...to attend...and just the dress...to wear...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Is anyone...there...? ...Anyone...there...?
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Oh...forgive me...forgive me, Mother...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
It wasn't my fault...I didn't want to...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
But...My Lord wanted to see...what a moving corpse looked like...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
That's the only...reason I...sucked their blood...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
And he was so...amused by the...number we had... in the crypt...
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
To heaving...yes...full to heaving, of course it would be!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Help me, help me, somebody help me! Help them, help them all!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I can't do anything else. There's nothing else I can do!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
I didn't have anything to begin with, so nobody would help me!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
No power, no talents, no friends!
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Aa&mdash;aaaaaaaah! If Mother abandons me, I'm as good as nothing...!
 
**Watchtower Fairy A:**
There she goes again...Fairy Knight Tristan is finally on her last legs.
 
**Watchtower Fairy A:**
Defeated by the Child of Prophecy, stripped of her Fairy Knight name, and Beryl Gut has disappeared.
 
**Watchtower Fairy A:**
Her last light of hope from Her Majesty's favors has finally been snuffed out. I've been ordered to seal the door with wax tomorrow.
 
**Watchtower Fairy A:**
I suppose execution is too much of a bother. Fairy Knight Tristan will vanish without a trace.
 
**Watchtower Fairy B:**
Is that so bad? It's a fitting end for the single most hated figure in Britain.
 
**Watchtower Fairy B:**
She's murdered more than her share of fairies. If I could, I'd snuff her out personally.
 
**Watchtower Fairy A:**
Leave it be. She's a rotting mess that can't even move anymore. Leave her be and let time take her.
 
**Watchtower Fairy A:**
Make one false move and you'll catch a curse. She's not worth the trouble of killing.
 
**Watchtower Fairy B:**
Hmm, you might be right. At any rate, we'll be taking charge of a former princess.
 
**Watchtower Fairy A:**
Who's there!? Her Majesty has ordered that no one may visit&mdash;Oh, you are&mdash;
 
**Fairies on Watch:**
Ga&mdash;ahh&mdash;
 
**Spriggan:**
&mdash;Hm, I hadn't heard there would be soldiers on watch.
 
**Spriggan:**
I've made you do something so trifling. Though, I'm sure they'd have found their next generation soon enough.
 
**Escorting Soldier:**
There's a key on the sentry's body. I will open the door. Are you sure about this?
 
**Spriggan:**
Of course, I'm told she's bedridden. Carry her with respect.
 
**Spriggan:**
I don't mind if you're forced to be a little rough with her. There's little time to waste.
 
**Escorting Soldier:**
Yes, sir. Alright, let's do this.
 
**Spriggan:**
To say she's not worth the trouble of killing. That's a very vulgar statement that one of them made.
 
**Spriggan:**
Most things have no value in the first place. It's only a matter of whether you should discard them or not.
 
**Spriggan:**
The worth is what you make of it&mdash;any old junk can have its use.
 
**I：???:**
Uh...uuh...waAAh...
 
**I：???:**
Must make sure...I have...to ask...
 
**I：???:**
Your...Majesty....Queen...Morgan...
 
**I：???:**
It can't...have been...true...not...by any...
 
**Aurora:**
Oh, how wonderful...! You're still alive, you uncompromising beast!
 
**Aurora:**
I could hardly believe my ears when Spriggan called me to ask if I would hide you.
 
**Aurora:**
Hehe, I can't believe you're really alive!
 
**Aurora:**
Coral, he needs medical attention! Let's use the most precious magic dust we have!
 
**Woodwose:**
Ahh...my thanks, Aurora...you are...truly...a lovely...fairy...
 
**Woodwose:**
I am ashamed...to have ever doubted you...ungh...ah... aah, ah...
 
**Coral:**
It's no good...I can't get the hole in his chest to close... and the magic dust has run out...
 
**Coral:**
Not to mention, the battle ended in victory for the Round Table Army. For us to shelter Lord Woodwose...
 
**Aurora:**
Don't give up. Get medicine from all over the city. It's of no concern who won the battle.
 
**Aurora:**
With the battle already over, we cannot just let him die.
 
**Aurora:**
Yes, isn't that so...? He's the proud head of the Fang Clan.
 
**Aurora:**
I will not let him die in misery, after all he did to protect Britain for centuries.
 
**Woodwose:**
Aurora...Aurora...ugh...I've made...such a mistake...
 
**Woodwose:**
If I had only listened...to your voice...from the beginning&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
Say no more. You should rest, Woodwose. Oh, but it's so hard to believe...
 
**Aurora:**
I wanted to believe that it was only gossip among the fairies...that Her Majesty had abandoned the Fang Clan...
 
**Woodwose:**
Gossip...gossip...Aurora...Her Majesty has done...what?
 
**Aurora:**
Oh, poor Woodwose...of course you wouldn't know...
 
**Aurora:**
Your reinforcements were never sent to begin with.
 
**Aurora:**
Her Majesty hated the Fang Clan for consuming so many humans. She was going to let you wipe each other out in the battle.
 
**Aurora:**
Her Majesty only values the Fairy Knights. She's not even trying to find your body.
 
**Aurora:**
I do hate to say this, but...
 
**Aurora:**
You've been abandoned, Woodwose, like a useless, outdated watchdog.
 
**Woodwose:**
I can't believe it...I won't believe it...I will not...
 
**Woodwose:**
Your...Majesty...it cannot be...it cannot...
 
**Woodwose:**
That you never...not once...loved the Fang Clan's loyalty...or devotion...
 
**Woodwose:**
I have to...make sure...
 
**Woodwose:**
I will make sure...even if it kills me...
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Oberon:**
Oh dear, what brings you outside the encampment? Too worked up to sleep?
 
**Oberon:**
Oh dear, even if the encampment's close by it doesn't mean a young girl ought to be wandering about alone.
 
**Oberon:**
What's the matter? Too nervous to sleep?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Same to you, Oberon. What are you doing here?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Having a heart-to-heart with Artoria. She still seemed lost, you see.
 
**Oberon:**
Even if our troops match theirs, they still have the Fairy Knights. If we let up, we'll end up losing.
 
**Oberon:**
That's why I gave her a pep talk!
 
**Oberon:**
“Artoria, did you know that the name King Arthur means king of bears!?”
 
**Oberon:**
Something like that☆
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can just imagine Artoria's face...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Or rather, I can already see it...
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
She hates to lose, you see. So getting her fired up was more effective than telling her off.
 
**Oberon:**
In a few more hours, the curtain of night will lift. When the morning lark sings, the final battle will begin.
 
**Oberon:**
I've done everything I can. There's nothing more I can do.
 
**Oberon:**
Well...I have my own regrets, though.
 
**Oberon:**
I fluttered about here and there, but in the end, I ran out of time. I couldn't find what I was looking for.
 
？1,1060,saveMaterial：What were you looking for again?
 
**Oberon:**
I speak of a star. A star beyond reach.
 
？2,2060,saveMaterial：Even though you said she's not here?
 
**Oberon:**
Should you not search for something just because it doesn't exist? You've got it the other way around, Fujimaru.
 
**Oberon:**
It is because it doesn't exist that we should search for it. It's why we yearn for it.
 
**Oberon:**
For me, my queen Titania is such an existence. Akin to the stars shining in the sky.
 
**Oberon:**
For the likes of us, struggling on the ground, it may be eternally unattainable.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Well, let's leave my story for another time. To be honest, I'm not used to opening my heart like this.
 
**Oberon:**
You should head back to the tent and get some rest. I can prepare some magical dust for you if you can't sleep, you know?
 
**Oberon:**
I'm no use in combat but putting someone to sleep is my forte. I won't even lose to the incubus Merlin.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I might just be imagining things, but...|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Hmm? What might be on your mind?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon, you always seem angry.|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Yeah, I guess.
 
**Oberon:**
Truth be told, I've been sulking ever since I heard that you guys have been wiping Lostbelts out.
 
**Oberon:**
Not directed at you. At those who will know of your story afterwards.
 
**Oberon:**
It's just the way it's always been. All events invariably become a “tale” for all except the parties involved.
 
**Oberon:**
Once decades have passed, your quest will end up as merely another “report”.
 
**Oberon:**
For those who peruse it, it's just seems like someone else's problem. A lesson to be learned. I'd hate that.
 
**Oberon:**
Half of the Fairy King Oberon was borne of a story.
 
**Oberon:**
That's why my feelings are divided.
 
**Oberon:**
The part of me that longs for the proper form of Britain as a Heroic Spirit of pan-human history.
 
**Oberon:**
And the part of me that wishes to continue this story as a fictional character.
 
**Oberon:**
Those two parts are still at odds, even now.
 
**Oberon:**
There is no problem with wiping out Lostbelts for the sake of pan-human history. We're basically there already.
 
**Oberon:**
But, it's hard to bear the thought of it being forgotten by future generations.
 
**Oberon:**
I don't want them to think that “their disappearance was a matter of course”.
 
**Oberon:**
I want them to know that it had meaning, even if it ends halfway through.
 
**Oberon:**
Well, that's just the ego of the parties involved for you, though.
 
**Oberon:**
Humans have made progress by viewing the past as a record. You can't just “stick to the same values” forever.
 
**Oberon:**
That's what “once upon a time” means. The word “old-fashioned” is also proof that we've moved forward.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you loathe Morgan, Oberon...?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
I am her enemy, but I don't loathe her. I've never even met her.
 
**Oberon:**
But...let's see. The story of this Fairy Kingdom isn't a bad one.
 
**Oberon:**
To put it into words, the Queen's Calendar is a fairy tale crafted by Morgan.
 
**Oberon:**
It's the incarnation of the dream she wished for, believed in, and dedicated her whole being to realize.
 
**Oberon:**
I pay tribute to the effort, regardless of whether it happens to be a masterpiece or mediocre.
 
**Oberon:**
That is exactly why I will also dedicate my whole being to defeat Morgan.
 
**Oberon:**
As a resident of the same fairy tale world, I don't want her final act to be a half-baked one.
 
**Oberon:**
Well, I'd lose if I don't give it my all, so it's not exactly my place to be talking about being half-baked, is it?
 
**Oberon:**
I'll leave Artoria in your hands, Fujimaru. I believe I've already said it earlier, but my role has reached its end.
 
**Oberon:**
From here on out, it's your fight. Please do show me a spectacular victory before I leave.
 
## Section 24: Morgan 
 
**Knocknarea:**
Daybreak comes! All units, form up!
 
**Knocknarea:**
The Round Table, gathered here under the Child of Prophecy... The northern fairies, my very hands and feet...
 
**Knocknarea:**
And volunteers from every corner of the land! We are now one army, united in purpose!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Our name is the New Queen's Army!
 
**Knocknarea:**
We are comrades in arms for the sake of building a new Britain to welcome the “true king” heralded in Ainsel's prophecy!
 
**Knocknarea:**
You there, Fujimaru! You look like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop!
 
**Knocknarea:**
No word of surrender has come from Camelot. Our pompous Queen is saying: “come and get me!”
 
**Knocknarea:**
That is exactly what I want! I've been waiting 100 years for this!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Are you all ready to fight, to give your lives? Let's do this once and for all!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Queen Morgan is our enemy, and Camelot is to fall! All troops, march! We'll bring down the main gate first!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Here we are...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Our situation is...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
The first division of the Round Table Army includes Artoria, Master Fujimaru, and Da Vinci.
 
**Mash:**
The second division includes Muramasa and Grimm.
 
**Mash:**
Knocknarea's main camp stands at the tail end of our lines,
 
**Mash:**
and is housing Rab-bit and Habetrot, who have declined to participate in the battle.
 
**Mash:**
I, Mash Kyrielight, have deployed with Master to the first division.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right. Muramasa and Grimm seem much stronger when paired together.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I was approached to bolster the strength of the second division, which will be drawing fire. Oh, speaking of which...
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Greetings to you, Commander Percival. We of the second division will now begin our march.
 
**Percival:**
Yes. As planned, you'll be the diversionary force that attacks the castle walls. We in the first division will escort the Giant Corps.
 
**Percival:**
Your unit will be isolated. If the battle is prolonged, you risk being trampled.
 
**Percival:**
Attack the walls as best you can, but take no needless risks.
 
**Percival:**
Once the main gate opens, you'll fall back to the base camp and await orders from Knocknarea.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Yes, sir! Leave it to us! We'll see to it that our mission is accomplished!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Child of Prophecy, Foreign Magus&ndash;pardon me, Lady Artoria and Fujimaru.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Please keep yourselves safe, and take care of the commander.
 
**Percival:**
We should begin our march too.
 
**Percival:**
The soldiers of the Queen's army are stationed at the main gate. Fairy Knight Barghest is in command.
 
**Percival:**
Knocknarea's giant corp will be breaking through the gate. Our role is to escort them there.
 
**Percival:**
It will be necessary to deal with both the Queen's army and Barghest.
 
**Percival:**
Artoria will stand in the vanguard, and pass her magecraft's blessings among the whole force.
 
**Percival:**
Fujimaru will use {(M)his/(F)her} formidable powers to combat the Queen's knights, and...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Barghest is our opponent.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But we have a secret pact with Barghest.|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course. We won't be fighting her.
 
**Da Vinci:**
As per our pact at Manchester, she'll declare her support for the Child of Prophecy as soon as we pass through the main gate.
 
**Artoria:**
But we never agreed to a common strategy.
 
**Artoria:**
As far as she's concerned, she will stay an honest knight to Morgan until the gate actually falls.
 
**Artoria:**
First we clear a path to the main gate. Afterwards, we keep the eyesore Barghest contained.
 
**Artoria:**
Is that what you had in mind, Da Vinci?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right. Barghest will be the last one to realize that you're in the vanguard.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We're all well aware of the risks, so let's confront them head on.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The surroundings are still just as we confirmed before dawn. Isn't it nice, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry, I know it all by heart.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It comes down to how quickly we pass the main gate, right?

**Oberon:**
I'm shocked. So you're saying Barghest is going to betray them for us?
 
**Artoria:**
Oberon!?
 
**Percival:**
Oberon!? Are you going into battle as well!?
 
**Oberon:**
Yeah. This is the final battle. Even in the worst case, you won't be needing a scout anymore.
 
**Oberon:**
Besides, I've had enough of being left out. I can be of some use on the battlefield.
 
**Oberon:**
More importantly, you guys were negotiating with Barghest?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right, when we were in the Lake District...|
 
**Oberon:**
Ahh...I see, that fits the timing. No wasted moves there, I'd say.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh? Didn't Da Vinci fill you in?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Me? Wasn't it you or Artoria who were going to?
 
**Artoria:**
It wasn't me. Fujimaru said {(M)he/(F)she}'d do it.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, Artoria. You said you would!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(That face...I completely forgot how it looked...!)
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
Wow...you really are completely lost without blatant context to guide you, Artoria.
 
**Oberon:**
What, did the bells only strengthen your magical energy? Is there anything that will improve that scatterbrained personality of yours?
 
**Artoria:**
W-well...I would rather not think about any good times spent with Bageko...
 
**Oberon:**
Seems the march has already begun...There's no use talking about what's already done.
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
But if Barghest is with us, the circumstances of Camelot's capture will change quite a bit.
 
**Oberon:**
With any luck, the lie will become truth.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hm? What's that?|
 

---

 
**Oberon:**
“Victory without sacrifices.” If Barghest is on our side, the only opponent is Lancelot.
 
**Oberon:**
If Muramasa and Grimm can keep her pinned down, the castle assault will be simple.
 
**Oberon:**
Good work, you two.
 
**Oberon:**
This way, we can reach Morgan's throne without losing a single person.
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria's escort is Percival. Fujimaru's escort is Mash.
 
**Oberon:**
Now, let's go! Let us first clear the way to the main gate!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Damn it, I figured in addition to being a diversion, I'd charge in if I found an opening, but&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
What's with this wall!? This is way too bizarre! It's hot, it's cold, it's slippery, and it's bouncy!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's responding so lithely. Is this thing alive or what? Dammit!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The ramparts of Camelot are made Orkney-style! They've got millennium grade oak in them!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Even if you break them, they'll immediately regenerate, it's pointless! It'll be faster if we just pry open the East Gate!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Our division here doesn't have the sort of tools for that! No choice but to hold out here!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No, wait a minute. You're a Caster, aren't you? Hey Blue, can't you just make us a foothold so we can jump over the ramparts!?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Oh! An oaken foothold against an oak tree! Sounds great to me, let's get them growing!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Actually, it's too late to be throwing out good ideas now, Red! &mdash;Above us! Someone's coming!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Ah! This sound—it's her!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Only the two Servants...? Then this must be the diversion. Too bad.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But you're not lacking. And I'm acquainted with both of you. No need to bother introducing yourselves.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The continuation of our battle at Sheffield, and the continuation of our battle at the Great Pit.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Let's wrap both of those up here. Servants do tend to be tenacious after all.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I'll cut you both into equal parts like the good friends you are. Muramasa horizontally and Grimm vertically.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We don't get along, he's just some old man I don't even know! Go ahead and shred him, I won't stop you for that!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Shut up, I'm getting serious here, Muramasa! I won't stop you if you want to slice him up, though!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
See, you do get along. That is excellent. It makes cutting you up worth it.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
A worthy opponent is hard to come by. Especially for the strongest species, like me.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Is that so? Then you'd best get serious too. You're the type of person who's never given it their all before, aren't you?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Very well! Holding back would be a waste against opponents like you!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I am the Fairy Knight Lancelot! You makeshift Divine Spirits of pan-human history, I'll cut through the both of you!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Got you!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;! Why are they receiving the Foreign Magus's support!?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's not support, it's a countermeasure. I over-prepared before we began our offensive.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I used my own magical energy to sustain the Servants that Fujimaru summoned.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
This is as far as that goes though. It really is tough to try and do that!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Who would have thought, but it's nuts to try and maintain Heroic Spirits from different mythological systems all at once!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Hmm, you really are mage-like...I suppose you don't call yourself wise for nothing...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
What did you think I was, then!?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I mean...you look like the type to start throwing spears...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The fame of the Declaration of the Great God —Gungnir—reaches even Britain...and I thought we were both fellow Lancers...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
What the hell...? Muramasa, is she really the same Lancelot?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I know it's hard to believe, but she's the real deal. This is her real self. A natural loner.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
... (I think I'll kill Muramasa after this.)
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Wait...that's strange.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Breaching the Main Gate should be your priority. The Foreign Magus' role is to give {(M)his/(F)her} all at the main gate.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The fact that there was spare energy to share with Grimm means&mdash;
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Report, report! The Main Gate has been opened and the Giant Corps have broken through!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Furthermore, Fairy Knight Barghest has surrendered!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
She has defected from the Queen's army! That ironclad fortress is now our ally!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Barghest...I knew you didn't seem very enthusiastic. So that's how it is...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Very well...you win this round.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Fairy Knight Lancelot lost here.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You will be able to report all three of Morgan's knights were vanquished by the Child of Prophecy's forces.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But remember, that's just the official story.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It's not like I actually lost or anything. Don't get the wrong idea.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
She's a dragon, alright...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That strongest species who, despite showing her understanding of the human world, refuses to listen to a single word.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Oh well, our job's over. I'll take the division and regroup with the main force, what about you?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I'll join up with Fujimaru.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Even if Barghest's on our side now, the siege is just starting.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Is that so? Go wild, then.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
&mdash;Morgan's no pushover.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
According to the first Grimm, she's apparently never been outmatched before.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
No matter where, no matter who she's up against, as soon as she joins the battle, casualties ensue.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's merely a question of whether it'll be Morgan or her enemy.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
She's a woman of steel who won't stop until either her enemy is dead, or she herself has been killed.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Leaving Artoria aside, Fujimaru and Mash are going to have a bad time with her.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You go help them out. And in case of emergency... you know what to do, don't you?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Naturally. Everyone keeps forgetting, but taking Morgan's head has always been my job.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Percival:**
The main gate has been opened! Proceed to enter the castle town!
 
**Percival:**
The Child of Prophecy will advance along the western route, suppressing enemy forces as she heads towards the castle!
 
**Percival:**
Should anyone surrender, welcome them! Follow Fairy Knight Barghest's example.
 
**Percival:**
Our objective is to establish a new Britain, one that can stand against the Great Calamity!
 
**Percival:**
There is no need to hate one another! Do not throw away your lives in vain!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Tch, that Percival! Hogging all the spotlight...!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I can't lose either!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Giant Corps, you did well breaching the main gate! But you must be at your limit already, fall back!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Wind division, lend the Round Table Army a hand.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Earth and Fang divisions, advance on the castle grounds as planned! Split into four and subjugate the Queen's army!
 
**Knocknarea:**
I shall lead the King's Clan and advance along the eastern route! Ox division, advance!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Knocknarea's on the front lines too!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I had a feeling she would be, though!)
 

---

 
**Knocknarea:**
Naturally. I can't set an example to my vassals if I don't put my own life on the line. If I fall from a stray arrow, then that's just how my fate goes.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It's pointless to tell me not to push myself. After all, the same goes for you too, right?
 
**Knocknarea:**
This is our only chance to confront Morgan in person. It's a race to see who gets into the castle first, Artoria!
 
**Artoria:**
No need to worry about Knocknarea. Let's push forward.
 
**Artoria:**
The main gate is still contested&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
I will suppress the Queen's forces stationed outside the walls.
 
**Barghest:**
If they see a Fairy Knight defector, more men should surrender.
 
**Barghest:**
Also, have a renowned soldier follow behind to keep an eye on me.
 
**Barghest:**
That should put the rebel soldiers at ease.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I suppose so. We know you won't betray us, but the same doesn't apply for the other soldiers.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And this is a chance to make a name for yourself, you know? If you defeat the Queen, there's a chance you may be accepted by the new ruler.
 
**Barghest:**
That won't be happening. I may have switched sides, but I have no intention of turning my blade against Her Majesty.
 
**Barghest:**
I intend to be imprisoned once the battle ends. I will leave the rest to you and the clans.
 
**Oberon:**
I see...so you're prepared to go that far. Then I shall keep an eye on you, Barghest.
 
**Oberon:**
Someone in good graces with the Round Table Army to stand by your side. At the very least, the rebel forces won't see you as an enemy.
 
**Oberon:**
However, please don't think this solves everything. Even if the main gate settles, there's still a lot that remains to be done.
 
**Oberon:**
You're also feared by the highborn fairies of Camelot.
 
**Oberon:**
What better way to make them submit than a single glare from you?
 
**Barghest:**
Indeed, that is the right way. If it's against them, I'll brandish my horn as often as you please.
 
**Barghest:**
But...I burned your forest down. Do you not loathe me, Oberon the rebel?
 
**Oberon:**
I do. But that's not something I need to be remembering now.
 
**Oberon:**
There are still others things that need to be done. Right, Percival?
 
**Percival:**
Of course...
 
**Percival:**
Let us answer the expectations of Fairy Knight Sir Barghest, who entrusted us with a new Britain.
 
**Percival:**
1st division, advance! The Child of Prophecy and the Foreign Magus are headed for the castle!
 
**Percival:**
The fulfilment of the prophecy is within reach! In the name of the Round Table, let us escort the two of them safely!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The main gate has been taken...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Only the innocent shall pass, huh? But, not a single fairy without sin exists in Britain.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That gate acknowledges this. It is her resolve to accept them, sinner or not.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
In other words, Morgan's one and only mercy. And they've trampled on it.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
In that case, there's no need for us to hold back either.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Crush the rebel cells on the castle grounds one by one, then execute Barghest the traitor.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That is the role of a Fairy Knight. I'll end this in twenty minutes&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
This wind is...from Aurora...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
What is she saying...?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
So this is Camelot...the city that Tonelico— no, Queen Morgan built&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
No, this is no time to be in awe. There's a colossal stockpile of magical energy...!
 
**Mash:**
I've seen several magical reactor cores before, but it's no exaggeration to say this surpasses them all!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes, it truly is the furthest end yet center of the world.
 
**Da Vinci:**
A phenomenon comparable to the “Tower of the Furthest End” that manifested in the Holy City Camelot...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if the tide of battle is in our favor, Morgan still possesses the trump card known as the “Holy Lance”.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Don't let your guards down. If it comes down to it, there's the possibility that she'll use Rhongomyniad.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We need to make it into the castle before she annihilates the entire city!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's right...!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Roger! I won't let Morgan do that. After all, this is the city of the Round Table, Camelot!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Rhongomyniad...?
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
I beg your pardon, Lady Da Vinci. But, what exactly is Rhongomyniad?
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Is that the name of a Fairy Knight? I've never heard the name before...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Rhongomyniad is, you know...
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
We're talking about the spears placed in front of Camelot...is the Round Table Army not aware of those?
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's a light composed of an immense amount of magical energy, capable of annihilating the surface on a scale close to that of the Great Pit's, although not quite that much&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
No, I see. So that's how it is.
 
**Da Vinci:**
No one in Britain has witnessed the light of Rhongomyniad before.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Morgan never used the Holy Lance during her conquest of Britain. There's not a single trace of its use in Britain!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But Muramasa said he was sure they were there!
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's probably the case...No doubt, Rhongomyniad is actually there.
 
**Da Vinci:**
However, not once did she use it. Morgan subjugated Britain with her own might alone.
 
**Da Vinci:**
In that case, what's the point of the Existence Tax?
 
**Da Vinci:**
If it's not for the sake of using Rhongomyniad, then what is all that magical energy being used for...?
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Fairy Knight Sir Barghest has surrendered to the rebellion. It would appear she has abandoned her post as guardian of the Main Gate.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Fairy Knight Sir Lancelot has taken to the skies above Camelot. Her current whereabouts are unknown.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
There are no reports of her defeat at the hands of the rebellion. It is assumed that she has disobeyed orders and deserted in the face of the enemy.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
The rebel forces have occupied 60% of Camelot. Of the Queen's knights, 42 are still battleworthy.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
The entrance to the castle has been cut off via use of a “mobile section”, but it will likely be breached eventually.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
What a disaster, the main gate has fallen!? And Barghest has defected, to boot!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Would you look at that, turns out she was just a lowly black dog! Giving her land made her forget her place!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Knocknarea has won over the giants! To think those things would be here, this is the problem with the northern fairies!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Those country bumpkins don't know the first thing about politics or economics! Oh, my prized business is going to be ruined!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Indemnity, that's right, indemnity! I am insured! I need to claim my insurance from Her Majesty!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Sir Lancelot's gone too!? Then who's going to beat them back!?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
I don't want Knocknarea to get here! I've been bad-mouthing her on the daily!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
She'll definitely kill me! Oh, I wonder if the Child of Prophecy will save me then! She will, won't she!?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Maybe...maybe...
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
The Queen's army is going to lose...? I-if they do, what will happen to we highborn fairies...?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Queen Morgan! O wise queen, what shall we do!?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
S-shall we surrender now!? Won't they stop if Her Majesty offers herself up!?
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;It is a matter of course. Your fears and worries are warranted.
 
**Morgan:**
Barghest has defected. Lancelot has disobeyed orders.
 
**Morgan:**
The main gate has been breached, and it is only a matter of time until they take the castle, as well.
 
**Morgan:**
Playtime with the Fairy Knights is over now. As you wish, I will change my approach.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Ohh! Her Majesty has left the throne! How wonderful! As expected of Her Majesty!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
But...what will she do now?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
The rebels won't stop just because she got up from her throne, you know?
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
&mdash;The officials shall remain silent. Fall prostrate with your backs against the wall. Weep and offer praise.
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
Her Majesty departs for the battlefield. The battlefield shall now belong to Her Majesty.
 
**Morgan:**
Now then&mdash;it's been 2,000 years since I have played seriously. I suppose I shall be careful not to checkmate them on the very first move.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Strange...we still haven't made it to the castle?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We got straight there during our audience...
 

---

 
**Percival:**
This is...what my sist&ndash;no, what I heard about in rumors. It appears to be...the “mobile section” of Camelot.
 
**Percival:**
It's said that the ramparts of Camelot and some of its buildings can change positions.
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, so that's why! I had a feeling the city's layout was different from the last time I came!
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see. I thought it was one large building after another, but it looks like this is a wall in itself.
 
**Da Vinci:**
On closer inspection, there appears to be rails running along the ground. Quite impressive, even if it just slides sideways.
 
**Mash:**
Then this means...we won't be able to use the route to the castle noted on this map anymore.
 
**Mash:**
If she can move the buildings, she can also disguise the entrance to the castle as a dead end.
 
**Percival:**
Ah! That's exactly right. Naturally, she must have sealed it off.
 
**Percival:**
Thank you, Mash, that was a great help. I was earnestly about to look for the entrance like a fool.
 
**Mash:**
N-no, it's nothing worth thanking me for...
 
**Mash:**
(The Percival of this Lostbelt...I haven't had the time to tell him...)
 
**Mash:**
(But he's different from how I imagined Percival to be... it almost feels like...he's the same age as me...)
 
**Artoria:**
I guess you shouldn't judge by appearances. In that case, over there! It should be over there!
 
**Artoria:**
The magical signature is the densest there! Either way, the throne's in that direction!
 
**Percival:**
Understood. Etwar, please relay this to the other squadrons.
 
**Percival:**
Camelot's terrain is shifting. Tell them to not blindly follow the map.
 
**Soldiers of the Wind Clan:**
You're fine with an unencrypted, open broadcast, right? Then that's an easy task. Leave it to me.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? There's a wind coming from Etwar...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
The “Voice of the Wind”. A specialty of the Wind Clan. They can have the winds carry their voices.
 
**Artoria:**
But it's not a particularly confidential means of communication, since other fairies will be able to hear you as well.
 
**Artoria:**
I think only powerful Wind Clan fairies are capable of using the “Voice of the Wind” to address specific individuals.
 
**Da Vinci:**
In other words, it's not much good for plotting or scheming. However, it's perfect for sharing information like we're doing now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Knocknarea will overhear too, but that's a different matter. Right now, our priority is to enter the castle.
 
**Percival:**
Yes. Let's settle things before the Queen's knights can restore their formations.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Hold on a minute.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Does it also rain ash with the wind?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Oh! Artoria!
 
**Artoria:**
Mash!?
 
**???:**
That shield, the Round Table, is it? I see the mages of pan-human history know neither fear nor respect.
 
**???:**
That place where heroes gather, the accumulation of the will to protect the country.
 
**???:**
To use it as one's personal arms. Even I would not think of such sacrilege.
 
**???:**
Or perhaps&ndash;that is exactly what pan-human history is.
 
**???:**
From the start, it has never bothered choosing the means to its survival.
 
**Artoria:**
No way&ndash;out of nowhere, in the middle of the city...!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No doubt about it...that's Morgan, Queen of the Fairy Kingdom!|
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
It is precisely because it is the middle of the city. There is no need to lie in wait for insects.
 
**Morgan:**
The throne of Camelot is the cornerstone of the Fairy Kingdom. I shall not allow it to be tainted by blood.
 
**Morgan:**
Child of Prophecy, Artoria. Magus of Chaldea, Fujimaru.
 
**Morgan:**
And&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
The Servant with the Saint Graph of Galahad the Heavenly Knight.
 
**Morgan:**
You did well completing the pilgrimage. I shall praise you.
 
**Morgan:**
The six clans have once again arrived at their moment of reckoning. Salvation shall be granted to all the fairies of Britain.
 
**Morgan:**
However&mdash;hmph, I feel contempt at the depths of my heart.
 
**Morgan:**
The Pilgrim's Bell is but an ephemeral matter.
 
**Morgan:**
The fairies will forget soon enough. And with it, your efforts, your suffering, your anger, your grief.
 
**Morgan:**
You should have realized that when you rang your second bell. Yet you did not abandon your pilgrimage.
 
**Morgan:**
You have chosen righteousness over this Britain turned lost. You are fine with that, yes?
 
**Artoria:**
Of course I'm not fine with it...Don't speak to me about things like righteousness.
 
**Artoria:**
I was only born because you abandoned your duty.
 
**Artoria:**
If you had seen it through, that girl would never have had reason to become king.
 
**Artoria:**
I don't know about the original sin of the six clans, nor do I care about it either. I just want to complete my mission and be at ease.
 
**Artoria:**
The origin of the Fairy Kingdom and Tonelico's suffering both have nothing to do with me!
 
**Artoria:**
I used to feel like there's no way I could take you on, but things are different now! Fight me, Morgan!
 
**Artoria:**
As for what comes after&mdash;I'll worry about that when the time comes.
 
**Artoria:**
I don't know what is right. I don't want to see or know my fate either.
 
**Artoria:**
Britain's future and the outside world are both beyond me. Unlike you&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Unlike you, I don't have that sort of upstanding ambition.
 
**Artoria:**
I just can't lose! That's all that I believe in!
 
**Morgan:**
I see. You have not grasped your true identity, even after your pilgrimage.
 
**Morgan:**
Come then. I will bring an end to that foolish destiny.
 
**Morgan:**
Artoria. You who were my bitter enemy in pan-human history.
 
**Morgan:**
You cannot go anywhere. You cannot change anything.
 
**Morgan:**
That is why I shall grant you mercy. If you cannot change it, then I shall.
 
**Morgan:**
It is time you went back to being a pitiful village girl. You will never reach the Site of Selection.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Morgan:**
A fatal wound...the first dealt to me since my battle with Mab.
 
**Morgan:**
As expected of one who has ablated many a Lostbelt.
 
**Morgan:**
I suppose I too have reached my limit, just like the Lostbelt Kings who fell before you.
 
**Morgan:**
However...Foreign Magus, you juvenile {(M)boy/(F)girl}...
 
**Morgan:**
In an isolated world that is a Lostbelt, a technique that exerts such power is abnormal.
 
**Morgan:**
In the future, should the chance befall you, return to the starting point of this cause and effect...
 
**Morgan:**
What is Chaldea? What is the Rayshift, and for what purpose is it provided?
 
**Artoria:**
Eh&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
What&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Queen Morgan's Saint Graph has dispersed. There's no mistaking it, we really&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did we beat Morgan...?|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
No, I mean, sure, she was absurdly strong! And sure, we are incapable of any further combat!
 
**Da Vinci:**
But Morgan hadn't shown us anything yet! Neither Rhongomyniad nor the truth behind the Fairy Kingdom!
 
**Da Vinci:**
She's just quitting while she's ahead at this rate, or more like quitting while she's behind. There are still far too many unknowns!
 
**Mash:**
But...
 
**Mash:**
Even if we had lost, I don't think Queen Morgan would have revealed anything to us.
 
**Mash:**
She never was one to say any more than what was necessary...
 
**Artoria:**
Morgan...alone 'til the bitter end...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aren't you glad you won...?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
I wonder...about that...
 
**Artoria:**
For a wicked queen, that kind of felt anticlimactic. I was prepared to face something even worse.
 
**Artoria:**
Haha...even though everyone's safe and sound, even though this ends the battle. It's strange, isn't it...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Artoria, you always called her Her Majesty, didn't you?
 
**Artoria:**
Eh&mdash;r-really?
 
**Artoria:**
I-is that so? There's no deeper meaning behind it, really. It's not like I respected her or anything at all. Haha...ha.
 
**Artoria:**
Haha...
 
**Artoria:**
Hahaha, ha...
 

---

 
**Percival:**
I'm sorry...I don't quite understand why everyone's feeling so down...
 
**Percival:**
But it is a fact that Queen Morgan has been felled. Is this not cause for celebration?
 
**Percival:**
Let's use the “Voice of the Wind” to let our troops know. That should bring the battle to an end.
 
**Artoria:**
T-that's right.
 
**Artoria:**
Too bad for Knocknarea, but we're the ones who defeated Queen Morgan&mdash;
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria, you idiot...!
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Eh?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Oberon?|
 

---

 
**???:**
You are blessed with good companions. In that aspect alone, Artoria, we are the same.
 
**???:**
&mdash;Although one of them will disappear, first of all.
 
**???:**
And next...there, the Servant who came for my head has disappeared.
 
**???:**
Now let's have this one here disappear. Percival, you will do.
 
**Mash:**
There's a powerful magical array in the sky...! This is...unmistakably&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
Surely you did not think it was over after defeating just one of me, did you now?
 
**Morgan:**
If so, then the fault lies with me for educating you poorly. I have been too gentle with the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Morgan:**
For a mage, it is a trifling matter to create an “alter ego equal to oneself”.
 
**Morgan:**
Now look to the sky. It is time you understood the reality before you.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
I was probably the only one who noticed the anomaly.
 
**Narration:**
A report from Blanca. The screams of the soldiers reaching me.
 
**Narration:**
The destruction taking place throughout Camelot, like a storm.
 
**Narration:**
Knocknarea's forces, Muramasa running all alone through the city, divisions on multiple fronts. All of them assaulted by the same enemy.
 
**Oberon:**
&mdash;It's Morgan. They're all fighting Morgan...!
 
**Narration:**
Familiars constructed with magecraft? No, that's not it. Judging by the quality of the magecraft, it's got to be Morgan herself.
 
**Narration:**
It's a thoughtform. An alter ego on the same standing as Morgan.
 
**Narration:**
Morgan has not left the throne. It didn't matter whether the Fairy Knights were present or not.
 
**Narration:**
What a blunder. This is my mistake. I underestimated the queen who reigned over Britain for 2,000 years.
 
**Narration:**
I should never have set up a 'war' against the likes of her. If she was to be defeated, it could only have been through assassination.
 
**Narration:**
Having an equal amount of troops was meaningless.
 
**Narration:**
Morgan alone outnumbers the entire military might of Britain.
 
**Narration:**
From the very start, that woman was capable of slaughtering the rebels without moving an inch from her throne...!
 
**Oberon:**
This is bad. Blanca, where's Fujimaru!? Where's Artoria!?
 
**Narration:**
I shrink down and hop on the hawkmoth with no regard for appearances. At times like this, these fake wings can be vexing.
 
**Narration:**
I have a bad feeling. Of course, it's not directed at anyone around me.
 
**Narration:**
I don't know the fates of others. What I do know is my fate alone.
 
**Narration:**
And it's been telling me all this time. That my role will end in the battle of Camelot.
 
**B：Oberon:**
Hurry, hurry...! A loss to Morgan is still preferable. It could still be salvageable.
 
**B：Oberon:**
But winning is bad. Winning would be the worst case scenario! Because Artoria will have lowered her guard!
 
**B：Oberon:**
Ahh, why didn't I warn them!
 
**B：Oberon:**
Winning one or two battles won't end anything! The battle goes on until we reach the throne!
 
**Narration:**
By the time I arrived, I no longer had the time nor the ability to warn them.
 
**Narration:**
Who should I protect? Fujimaru or Artoria?
 
**Narration:**
Process of elimination made it clear. Fujimaru will be fine.
 
**Narration:**
{(M)He/(F)She} is an observer, just like me. Destiny does not seek {(M)his/(F)her} life.
 
**Narration:**
So the one I should be protecting here is that foolish girl alone.
 
**Narration:**
A daredevil with poor self-esteem. Yet she hates to lose and won't listen to others.
 
**Narration:**
That girl continues to protect an obsession I don't understand, as if holding a jewel in both hands.
 
**Oberon:**
Artoria, you idiot...!
 
**Narration:**
“In that case...I'm just glad I'm able to stay warm at night, I suppose.”
 
**Narration:**
“Ehehe...it's embarrassing, so I'm keeping it a secret from everyone, though!”
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;The memory of a trivial winter springs to mind.
 
**Narration:**
There was no time to run, no time to say our farewells.
 
**Narration:**
It's frustrating, but there's no helping it. I'll just assume the lamp has fallen and give up.
 
**Narration:**
Winter's light envelops me completely. I do feel it's a tad bit too early to hibernate, though.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
The storm swept in at a moment's notice. It was a curtain that was abruptly lowered unto the stage.
 
**Narration:**
The shadows of the queen that appeared in the skies above Camelot mercilessly scorched the surface.
 
**Narration:**
The way back had been walled up, preventing retreat. Even if one were to flee into the buildings,
 
**Narration:**
the Queen would set the city ablaze alongside the rebels. That is what it means to raze.
 
**Narration:**
A suicidal counterattack amounts to nothing before the Queen. All it leads to is a one-sided slaughter.
 
**Narration:**
Warcries of advance turned into screams of retreat, and once it became clear even that would not be allowed, they turned into resentment.
 
**Narration:**
Witch. Witch. Witch. That is no queen.
 
**Narration:**
She is the witch of Britain, the incarnation of death that torments, scorns, and reaps fairies.
 
**Artoria:**
Oberon...everyone...even Muramasa...really?
 
**Morgan:**
Not one shall be left alive. The same goes for the Foreign Magus.
 
**Morgan:**
The price of hubris paid for a single pilgrimage. The blame lies on those who have raised you up.
 
**Morgan:**
Perish, along with your mission. My Fairy Kingdom has no need for Paradise nor the outside world.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Morgan:**
...Hmm. I had my concerns, but it would appear Merlin has no intention of helping. Such a heartless man.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Ahh...aaaaa&mdash;everyone&mdash;everyone&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
Yes. Your foolishness led to their deaths.
 
**Morgan:**
No resolve, no prospects of victory. You came here without having faith in anyone.
 
**Morgan:**
A fledgling Avalon le Fae. My sister, seduced by prophecy.
 
**Morgan:**
No one will thank you. No one will reach out to you.
 
**Morgan:**
No one to reward you. No one to praise you. No one to share in your happiness.
 
**Morgan:**
You will die alone on a bloodstained hill, just like the you from pan-human history.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
To save Britain. The Child of Prophecy's fate was sealed the moment you made that your goal.
 
**Morgan:**
You cannot save that which is already dead.
 
**Morgan:**
You should have struggled not against me, but against the mission that drove you.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She disappeared...?|
 

---

 
**N：Voices Echoing in the Wind:**
...Hear me...can you hear me?
 
**N：Voices Echoing in the Wind:**
I am Aurora, head of the Wind Clan.
 
**N：Voices Echoing in the Wind:**
Since I am unable to fight, this is the most I can do...
 
**N：Voices Echoing in the Wind:**
I pray my voice reaches all the fairies in Britain.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aurora's voice is reverberating through Camelot...|
 

---

 
**N：Voice of Aurora:**
Right now, at this very moment, brave fairies are fighting at Camelot to overthrow Queen Morgan.
 
**N：Voice of Aurora:**
Her Majesty's power is overwhelming. But more importantly, we revered her.
 
**N：Voice of Aurora:**
That noble figure who continued to protect our Britain for 2,000 years. There isn't a single fairy who would not revere her.
 
**N：Voice of Aurora:**
However...despite that kindness, there are certain truths that I cannot overlook.
 
**N：Voice of Aurora:**
To those of you fighting at Camelot, I beg you to listen.
 
**N：Voice of Aurora:**
To the truth about who Queen Morgan really is, and what she has been doing behind the curtains of history.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Hahahahahaha! Look at that pathetic sight! The rebels are fleeing!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
That's what you lowly fairies get for breaking into Camelot! Look at them scampering for help after the escape route got blocked off!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
What are you all so happy about? My house is gone! This is too much, at this point they're the ones coming out on top!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Your Highness, please stop! Could you, perhaps, use magecraft that kills only them or something!?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
What are you on about? This is fun, so much fun! It's a festival, a damned festival. This is how war should be!
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
...
 
**Morgan:**
Hmm, I was sure I had finished him off...this Muramasa is indeed a stubborn one.
 
**Morgan:**
I suppose I shall send two more out. Three should suffice for the Child of Prophecy&mdash;Meldick?
 
**Clerk Meldick:**
...Your...Majes...ty...
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
W-w-what's going on!? Her Majesty's attendant, the knight Meldick, has fallen!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Meldick is Her Majesty's escort, you know!? He's no ordinary knight, he can't simply have&mdash;
 
**???:**
Give praise...fall prostrate...
 
**???:**
The defender of Britain...we of the Fang Clan call you... our master......
 
**???:**
We stand...in the presence of...the Queen... we stand before...Her Majesty...
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
W-w-what are you!? Where did you come from!?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Guards! What are the guards doing!?
 
**Morgan:**
Woodwose. You yet live.
 
**Morgan:**
Did you use the underground bypass? I recall it was during the Mors Campaign that I told you about it.
 
**Morgan:**
You did well remembering something from a thousand years ago.
 
**Woodwose:**
Of course...that which you made privy only to me... just in case...
 
**Woodwose:**
I, Woodwose...have not forgotten...not even for a fleeting moment...
 
**Woodwose:**
Your Majesty. Your Majesty...please tell me, Your Majesty&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
Where is the Child of Prophecy...Where is Beryl Gut...
 
**Woodwose:**
No...no, no, no...! Such trivial matters mean nothing to me...!
 
**Woodwose:**
Why did you not send me reinforcements...? Why did you abandon the Fang Clan to their fate...?
 
**Woodwose:**
Please...let me hear it from you...Your Majesty... Queen Morgan!
 
**Morgan:**
Reinforcements?
 
**Morgan:**
Oh, you mean the Londinium affair? What a strange thing to ask.
 
**Morgan:**
I did send reinforcements. But it would appear they were all useless, the lot of them.
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;aaaaaa&mdash;aaa&mdash;aaaaaaaaaa&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
So you insist on having faith in Her Majesty no matter what...? Then, keep this in mind.
 
**Aurora:**
If Her Majesty tells you that she sent no reinforcements, that is the truth.
 
**Aurora:**
It means Her Majesty had faith in your power and decided they were unnecessary.
 
**Aurora:**
But...if she tells you reinforcements were sent...
 
**Aurora:**
Then that is a lie. A lie meant to deceive you. A lie meant to cast off the Fang Clan.
 
**Aurora:**
After all, reinforcements were never sent. That is the indubitable truth.
 
**Aurora:**
Her Majesty decided to abandon you because you've outlived your usefulness.
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;Mor...gan&mdash; &mdash;Moooooooorrrrrrgaaaaan!
 
**Morgan:**
...!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Eeek! W-W-Woodwose's gone mad! Mad!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Someone stop him, Her Majesty has fallen! At this rate, she'll get beaten to death!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
You can't stop Woodwose, it's impossible! I won't do it, I won't do it!
 
**Woodwose:**
I'll kill you, I'll kill you...!
 
**Woodwose:**
Our loyalty spanning 2,000 years...my 1,000 years of loyalty! How dare you...how dare you mock it...!
 
**Woodwose:**
You have no love, you never had any love!
 
**Woodwose:**
Die, die, die, die!
 
**Woodwose:**
I don't need a master who doesn't love me! Accursed witch! You accursed witch! I was foolish to have believed in you!
 
**Woodwose:**
I should have been the king of Britain! I, an A-Rei, should have been the one to stand at the apex!
 
**Woodwose:**
What Fairy Kingdom? A country for us!? If only—if only you didn't exist!
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;Guh.
 
**Morgan:**
My goodness...after you went through such pains to learn decorum, you fool.
 
**Morgan:**
Bloodshot eyes. How very unsightly.
 
**Morgan:**
That fur coat of yours alone remained unchanged. Young hero. Brave Woodwose.
 
**Morgan:**
That fur of yours was the warmest and loveliest in all Britain.
 
**Woodwose:**
&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
...aaaa...aaaaaa, a...aaa...
 
**Woodwose:**
What have I...what have I done...
 
**Woodwose:**
If you don't put it into words...If you don't put it into words, I won't understand&mdash;
 
**Woodwose:**
Forgive me...
 
**Woodwose:**
Forgive me, Your Majesty...even though I was this loved, I&ndash;
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
T-thank goodness you're alright, Your Majesty... W-why don't you take a rest? You're in no condition to be walking around...
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
What are you talking about? The rebels still remain! Your Majesty, the throne awaits you!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Please exercise your power to the fullest! That is what makes you the monarch of Britain!
 
**Morgan:**
That goes without saying...the throne is...over there.
 
**Spriggan:**
No. There is no need to return to the throne. I'm afraid you have no right to do so.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;You're the one who directed Woodwose here.
 
**Morgan:**
Do you tire of living, Spriggan? To think you'd seek your own downfall.
 
**Spriggan:**
No, no. My lifespan is always a source of concern for me, but this is a different matter altogether.
 
**Spriggan:**
This time, I came with an assurance of victory. On the contrary, I'd even say now is the perfect opportunity.
 
**Spriggan:**
Your Fairy Kingdom has been wonderful.
 
**Spriggan:**
There has been no other instance of a single monarch reigning for 2,000 years.
 
**Spriggan:**
But it has been a bit boring. If you forbid cross-cultural exchanges, then the arts won't flourish.
 
**Spriggan:**
You can hardly call it a country if there's neither prosperity nor decline.
 
**Spriggan:**
Queen Morgan, Britain is not your garden. I think it's time you awaken from your girlish dream.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;You underestimate me.
 
**Morgan:**
Even if only my head remains, I shall not fall to the rank and file.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;Baobhan...Sith.
 
**Girl with Limbs Rotting Off:**
“Thank you, Lady Witch. Thank you for all your hard work.”
 
**Girl with Limbs Rotting Off:**
“Everyone speaks ill of you, but I'm grateful to you, Lady Witch.”
 
**Girl with Limbs Rotting Off:**
“Thank you for all you've done for us. Thank you for all you've done for someone like me.”
 
**Girl with Limbs Rotting Off:**
“Thank you for all your hard work. Please, please rest in peace now.”
 
**Narration:**
At the start of it all, back when I had no companions,
 
**Narration:**
I was referred to not as a Savior, but as a witch.
 
**Narration:**
When I opened my eyes in Orkney, I received knowledge from another me.
 
**Narration:**
The Morgan of pan-human history.
 
**Narration:**
The Fairy Princess who chose to entrust everything to me, despite knowing she herself would shatter.
 
**Narration:**
I learned of Morgan's fate.
 
**Narration:**
A woman who had no place of her own in pan-human history.
 
**Narration:**
A woman who was vanquished by King Arthur, despite having been born as the heir to Britain.
 
**Narration:**
To Morgan, Britain was everything.
 
**Narration:**
If she could not have Britain, Morgan would have no worth.
 
**Narration:**
And so she became worthless.
 
**Narration:**
Summoned to the British Lostbelt, that “me” must surely have lamented after seeing the tragic state of the island.
 
**Narration:**
But she surely must have also thought this:
 
**Narration:**
“This time, in this Britain.”
 
**Narration:**
For the “me” with no place to belong, protecting this new place of hers must have been the obvious thing to do.
 
**Narration:**
I was given a task from Paradise, but that task was to end Britain.
 
**Narration:**
“I” loved the island of Britain, even if it happened to be a Lostbelt.
 
**Narration:**
I too, felt the same way.
 
**Narration:**
Thus, I chose to live as “me”.
 
**Voices of the fairies:**
Accursed witch, accursed witch, accursed witch! Even though a Calamity occurred, you alone survived!
 
**Narration:**
But to do that, I must first subdue the fairies.
 
**Narration:**
I cleansed the Calamities time and time again, I mediated the conflicts between the clans time and time again.
 
**Narration:**
Time and time again, I was branded a witch. Time and time again, my heart broke.
 
**Narration:**
But that is fine. I do not love the fairies.
 
**Narration:**
What I love is Britain. This country that I will belong to, that I will build.
 
**Narration:**
A Britain of my own that I could never obtain in pan-human history.
 
**Narration:**
I felt that there was nothing I would not do to realize that, and so I did my best.
 
**Narration:**
However, looking at the means, protecting the fairies turned out to be the right answer after all.
 
**Girl Discarded due to Overuse:**
“Thank you, thank you...” “Thank you for giving me water, thank you...”
 
**Girl Discarded due to Overuse:**
“But, Lady Witch, please drink it yourself. After all, you've been working so hard.”
 
**Narration:**
Over the years, I've grown rather fond of the means as well.
 
**Narration:**
I gained companions I could confide in. I got better at conducting myself.
 
**Narration:**
And I learned how to act like the Savior I never was.
 
**Narration:**
I thought that if I am to be a Savior, then the fairy who gave me a name would rejoice. Thus, I changed my name to Tonelico.
 
**Narration:**
Londinium is lost. All my companions have left me.
 
**Narration:**
But that is fine. This time, I shall build my ideal country, my Britain.
 
**Narration:**
I have been living for this reason alone. For that reason alone, “I” had shattered.
 
**Narration:**
My Britain. My Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Narration:**
To tell the truth, I had been planning on making it a far harsher country. But I would feel sorry for her if I did so, and thus, chose a kinder path.
 
**Narration:**
I shall allow you to laugh. I shall allow you to have fun.
 
**Narration:**
I shall allow you to forge connections. I shall allow you to prosper. And I pray it lasts forevermore.
 
**Narration:**
I am a traitor to the Human Order. I went against my mission from Paradise and realized my dream instead.
 
**Narration:**
Though the Fairy Kingdom is isolated by the wall of the furthest end, it still exists on the same coordinates on the planet.
 
**Narration:**
Visitors from pan-human history may come.
 
**Narration:**
How was my country? Was it a beautiful country? Was it a dream-like country?
 
**Narration:**
Nothing would make me happier than that.
 
**Narration:**
My dear visitor, welcome to the Fairy Kingdom of Britain.
 
**Narration:**
I pray this scenery will forever remain within your memories.
 
**Spriggan:**
What!?
 
**Morgan:**
Haa&mdash;aaa&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
I told you not to underestimate me...even if all that remains is my head, you are still no match for me.
 
**C：Morgan:**
Aaa...haaaa...haaa...
 
**C：Morgan:**
Haa...haaa...haaaa...!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(W-w-what should we do, what do we do...!? Spriggan's rebelling, isn't he!?)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Does that make Spriggan the King, then? No, no, Queen Morgan is still alive!)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Even though she can't move anything other than her left hand anymore? She's not going to beat the rebels this way, you know?)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Hold on, then what happens to us? We'll be killed by the rebels!)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(Should we help Her Majesty, then? Spriggan isn't very dependable...if we get her back to the throne, she might be able to do something?)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(No thanks, she's drenched in blood. Besides, it'd just be for show no matter who we side with.)
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
(You're right, you're right! Let's wait and see! We can just pick the winning side!)
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
However...despite that kindness, there are certain truths that I cannot overlook.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
To those of you fighting at Camelot, I beg you to listen.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
To the truth about who Queen Morgan really is, and what she has been doing behind the curtains of history.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
That's Aurora's “Voice of the Wind”! What on earth does she want to say?
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
All of this was schemed by a single woman.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
The savior, Tonelico, who was said to have saved the fairies during the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
She is no fairy of Britain. She is a fairy who came from a different world. She is our enemy.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
Her goal was to rule Britain.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
For that reason, she caused many Calamities to occur and disrupted the bonds between the clans.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
Chief amongst those acts was the destruction of Londinium.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
She killed Uther, the King of Britain, when he appeared at long last, and broke the harmony between the clans.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
For her, all other monarchs were eyesores.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
The blood and hatred that surged in this conflict caused the largest ever Great Calamity to occur.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
There are few fairies still alive now to speak of it...
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
But on that day, 2,000 years ago, our Britain perished once.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
What is Aurora saying? We perished?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
That's not possible. Then what would that make the fairies still alive now!?
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
No. Rather, it would have been better to have perished in the Great Calamity.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
Because the fairies who survived would have been able to build a peaceful Britain afterwards.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
But that did not happen. Having survived the fall of Londinium, Tonelico&mdash;
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
The witch Morgan undertook a terrifying endeavor.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
Morgan used our precious World Tree for her own ends.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
She stole the magical energy stored within the World Tree and desiccated it.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
Using that magical energy, she revived us fae with what was apparently called a Chaldea-type summoning.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
The Command Spell we fairies bear is not something carved into us at Camelot.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
They are something possessed from birth. The mark of a slave, offering its accumulated time and magical energy to the witch.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
Thus, the witch started a new Britain. Along with a false era known as the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
The reason why the land of Britain does not expand, the reason we are not permitted to make effective use of humans.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
And the reason Britain perished in the Great Calamity. It is because they were all designed as such.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
Please know this. For around 2,000 years, we fairies of Britain...
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
...were made to suffer, used by the witch for her own ends.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
The name of this witch is Morgan. The false monarch who came from Paradise to subjugate us.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
I do acknowledge her efforts in saving Britain from the Mors time and time again...however, I cannot revere her.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
O fairies of Camelot. Please ask yourselves this once again.
 
**Voice of Aurora:**
Who is our true enemy? To which fairy should we entrust Britain?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
...isn't that awful?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Awful. It is awful.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
It really is awful. What a joke of a queen. Come to think of it...
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
We don't really need her, do we?
 
**Spriggan:**
Now this is no good...The fire's spreading faster than I expected.
 
**Baobhan Sith:**
Ah...
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Go~back~. Go~back~.
 
**Morgan:**
Haa...haa...ha, a&mdash;
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
Hey, we're throwing stuff at her but she isn't stopping! Can't help it, let's use that soldier's sword over there to stop her!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around the Throne:**
That's right, let's do that! You won't deceive us anymore, you vile witch!
 
**C：Morgan:**
&mdash;You wretches&mdash;what are you&mdash;
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
Shut up! You've made this world a horrible place!
 
**Morgan:**
You are wrong...take me to the throne...without me&mdash;
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
Even though you can't do a thing, you went and messed our world up over and over!
 
**Morgan:**
Stop, stop&mdash;someone, please&mdash;
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
Vile witch! Vile witch! You're slothful, even though you should've been able to build a far better world!
 
**Morgan:**
Stop&mdash;take me to the throne&mdash;
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
Useless! Useless! We don't need you! We don't need you! If you're useless, then we don't need you anymore!
 
**Morgan:**
Take me back to my throne...! I don't want to lose Britain again...!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
Whew, she finally stopped moving. She struggled right up to the very end.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
But how refreshing, she brought this on herself. She's been tormenting us fairies all this time.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
By the way...
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
What's that filthy fairy lying over there?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The bells&mdash;|
 

---

 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Report, report! Report from the Knocknarean army!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
“I have reached the throne. The bells of triumph shall reverberate in testament.”
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
“Queen Morgan has been executed by the knights of Aurora before the throne.”
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
“The officials who served the Queen have been detained. The Knocknarean army has seized the throne.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
“Furthermore, for his contribution towards Morgan's execution, Spriggan shall be appointed interim chief of the six clans.”
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Executed. Was Morgan killed? Is she no longer alive?
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Yes. The corpse is said to be severely damaged beyond recognition. As such, there will be no next generation.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Currently, the Queen's knights have begun surrendering all over the place.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
We are to gather before the throne as soon as our wounds have healed.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
It is unfortunate that you could not claim the throne, Lady Artoria...
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
But the battle is over. The rebellion has triumphed!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Things are going to get busy from now on in a different way.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
We all have to prepare for the coronation of Queen Morgan's successor, no&ndash;the new leader of Britain.
 
**Morgan:**
Why?
 
**Morgan:**
Why are you like this?
 
**Morgan:**
Why are you always like this, Baobhan Sith!?
 
**Narration:**
That person lamented, almost as though for herself, and embraced me.
 
**Narration:**
But I'm already dead. I always, always die.
 
**Morgan:**
I'm always too late. I always find you only after you've already ended up like this...!
 
**Morgan:**
No matter how many times you're reborn, you always end up like this&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
Deceived. Manipulated. Used. Tossed aside once broken.
 
**Morgan:**
Be angry if you've been deceived. Run if they are violent with you!
 
**Morgan:**
Yet, why&mdash;why do you always forgive them...!?
 
**Narration:**
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Lady Witch. I'm sorry I died again in the end.
 
**Narration:**
The current generation of me may not remember, but thank you for always crying for my sake.
 
**Narration:**
But don't worry.
 
**Narration:**
I'm a worthless fairy, so this is the least I can do to be of use to everyone else.
 
**Narration:**
If using me will make things easier for everyone in the village, then that surely must be a good thing.
 
**Morgan:**
&mdash;That is not true.
 
**Morgan:**
You and you alone&mdash;thanked me in this Britain.
 
**Morgan:**
I will definitely save you. I will definitely make sure to save you.
 
**Morgan:**
I will definitely find you, before the next generation of you can be picked up by those fairies.
 
**Morgan:**
And this time&mdash;I will make you happy.
 
**Narration:**
But I couldn't do it.
 
**Narration:**
Time and time again, Mother found me. Yet each time, it always ended like this.
 
**Narration:**
The village's darling, Baobhan Sith. The ever-smiling Baobhan Sith.
 
**Narration:**
I always end up worked to the bone, all the while being told I'm a “good person”.
 
**Narration:**
That's why Mother told me.
 
**Narration:**
That's why, after I died at Darlington with my soul worn out, with no next generation to speak of, she brought me back to life and told me:
 
**Morgan:**
You should live heinously. You should live cruelly. You cannot live otherwise.
 
**Morgan:**
Just once. Even just once is fine. If it means you can lead a happy life&mdash;
 
**Morgan:**
I will offer Britain, my dream, to you.
 
**Narration:**
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mother. That didn't work out either.
 
**Narration:**
I hate fairies. Because they always bully me.
 
**Narration:**
I couldn't make even a single friend. Because I was always filthy.
 
**Narration:**
But&mdash;there was one, there was one fairy I could talk normally with.
 
**Narration:**
How strange. Even though I hate all of Britain's fairies, I was able to talk normally with that girl alone.
 
**Narration:**
What was the name of that girl again&mdash; What was the name of that city again&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
What exactly happened back then&mdash;
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
An accomplice. An accomplice. She's her daughter, so she's an accomplice.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
I mean, she really tormented us. Let's take our time with this one.
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
Wow, she's filthy. Her limbs are rotting! What do we do, what should we do!?
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
Let's not bother. Just chop her up and toss her out! Out behind the throne!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
After all, she's dropped her fair share of people down there already! Bye-bye, Morgan's princess!
 
**Fairies Gathered Around Morgan:**
Thanks to you, we'll be able to keep living in this castle for the rest of our lives!
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
Haha...ahaha...ahahahahahahaha!
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
I couldn't stop them, I couldn't stop them!
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
Even though Mother was being brutalized, I was too scared to stop them!
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
Haha...hahaha...haha...aa...aaaaa...aaaaaaaa...!
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
...
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
...
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
I'm done...
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
I'm tired. I don't want to be here anymore.
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
That's right...I'll run...I'll disappear...There's a... perfect hole over there.
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
Hehe, hehehe...
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
Cernunnos...Cernunnos...
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
The only one Mother was afraid of. The scary god, Cernunnos.
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
The bright red eyes at the bottom of the Great Pit... the lid of the apocalypse that 2,000 years couldn't close off...
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
Ahaha...ahahahahahahaha...
 
**Morgan's Successor:**
Ahahahaha&mdash;ha—
 

## Intermission 
 
**Gordolf:**
Ah, it's been 45 days since we began our concealed operation off the coast of Britain.
 
**Gordolf:**
I assembled you all here for one reason. Once we leave this Lostbelt...
 
**Gordolf:**
Or is it “Lostworld” now, following the technical advisor's report? In either case, we have the choice to either withdraw and return to normal space,
 
**Gordolf:**
or send additional forces (Meunière and myself) to support the conquest of this “Lostworld”.
 
**Gordolf:**
We've finally reached a point where our hands are forced, and one or the other must be chosen&mdash;
 
**Gordolf:**
Hmph, Tifone returned some time ago. Captain!
 
**Nemo:**
Roger. Control room, restart.
 
**Meunière:**
Hah! The control room is lit again!? Then, does that mean&mdash;
 
**Gordolf:**
Yes, mission accomplished! We just received word that Morgan has been defeated!
 
**Gordolf:**
Fujimaru, Da Vinci, Kyrielight, you did it!
 
**Gordolf:**
In recognition of our meritorious deeds, the fairies are going to gift us with one of Camelot's Rhongomyniads!
 
**Nemo Marines:**
Yaay! Yaay! We're even getting the real thing and not just the magic formula!
 
**Nemo Marines:**
Now the Border will have a main guuun! We want to be in charge of gunnery!
 
**Nemo:**
I'll allow up to four crew. We'll draw lots later so it's fair.
 
**Gordolf:**
Rhongomyniad as the main gun, huh...hehehe. Naturally, as the director, I will handle the final trigger...
 
**Nemo Professor:**
Don't be so hasty. We're a long way from that, Master Gordolf.
 
**Nemo Professor:**
But this sure puts a grin on my face, as well. Large gun batteries on a ship's deck are so romantic.
 
**Gordolf:**
Indeed. I'd like to install it on the bow, but that's too terrible to contemplate.
 
**Gordolf:**
It would be preferable if we could purge the deck immediately in case it malfunctioned somehow.
 
**Gordolf:**
Anyway...
 
**Gordolf:**
The report says it will take seven days to transport it from Camelot to the coast.
 
**Gordolf:**
We decided we would remain here for seven more days.
 
**Gordolf:**
As it is no longer necessary to conserve power in case of emergency, we've restored it in the control room.
 
**Gordolf:**
Up 'til now we've consumed the minimum necessary power, but from now on we can be less strict with our rationing.
 
**Gordolf:**
It's been an uncomfortable 45 days together. Regain your strength and make preparations to receive Rhongomyniad!
 
**Holmes:**
...
 
**Gordolf:**
What is it, Administrative Advisor? This is the part where we smile and celebrate our victory, you know?
 
**Gordolf:**
I mean, come on. I can't believe I have to tell you something so obvious.
 
**Gordolf:**
You're putting on a face that says “&mdash;here is where the case really begins.”
 
**Gordolf:**
Have you noticed the energy you give off?
 
**Holmes:**
My thanks for the warning, Mr. Gordolf. Watson often said as much to me.
 
**Holmes:**
But a correction: it is not a “feeling.” It is fact that we have finally reached the climax of the case.
 
**Gordolf:**
Really? But the Lostbelt King is...you know?
 
**Holmes:**
We have not settled anything, New Director.
 
**Holmes:**
Why was this Lostbelt born? Why was this Camelot constructed?
 
**Holmes:**
What is the purpose of the Pilgrim's Bell ritual? What is the mission of the Fairies of Paradise?
 
**Holmes:**
Moreover, regarding the first Fairy Calendar... where the British Island came to an end before Morgan's involvement...
 
**Holmes:**
Those Great Calamities...where did the Red and Black Calamities disappear to?
 
**Holmes:**
To begin with, who exactly was the original adversary who wanted to destroy Britain?
 
**Holmes:**
Not to mention this unnatural sense of malice that flickers through Da Vinci's reports...
 
**Holmes:**
The true culprit...no, the truth is something entirely different.
 
**Holmes:**
I agree with restoring power and regaining our spirits. &mdash;However, it is not yet time for us to return home.
 
**Holmes:**
Please, put us on alert for the worst-case scenario.
 
**Holmes:**
This is where we of Chaldea are necessary—the battle to save the world.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And just like that, we're back in Salisbury.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yes. After the battle was over, we discussed how to handle Camelot in the aftermath, got in a carriage, and now we're here three days later.
 
**Artoria:**
Just about everything has been taken care of. Everywhere we went, the fairies greeted us with praise.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Barghest stayed behind in Camelot to serve as Knocknarea's proxy in negotiations with the upper-class fairies.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Percival stayed behind as well to oversee the acquisition of the Holy Lance installed at the front of the castle.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It'll be one more day to remove it, while it will take three days to transport it to the shore where the Storm Border is anchored.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Still...I'm a little worried about Percival's condition. He says nothing is wrong, but...
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah...his movements were noticeably more labored...
 
**Artoria:**
I told him to take a break right away, but he “has to repay everyone,” so he wouldn't listen...
 
**Da Vinci:**
We don't have a lot of time left ourselves, so he's really saved us...
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's it, after he gets us the Holy Lance, we'll have him go straight to the Border's recovery pod!
 
**Da Vinci:**
That should at least take care of his fatigue. We'll treat him with the full course of modern medical technology.
 
**Da Vinci:**
From what I've heard, it seems like he's been overworking himself ever since the Round Table Army was formed☆
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Whoa there, you should use that pod thing on Habetrot too.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Ever since Morgan was overthrown, she's been losing more and more energy every day. She says she's just sleepy, though.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
She just sleeps, wakes up, writes in her journal, sleeps, wakes up, and writes in her journal, over and over.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
She won't leave her bed here at the inn. She must have built up a lot of fatigue.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Still...are you really okay with this, Artoria?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's fine that we're emulating Morgan by having the coronation ceremony in Salisbury's cathedral.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
“I'm handing over the throne to Knocknarea. I'm returning to Tintagel.”
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Now that you've said that, the next queen will be Knocknarea.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Even after helping you get this far, I don't understand giving up your victory that easily.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, now that the Child of Prophecy has said it, the other clans can't raise a stink,
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
and it's a good thing that things aren't moving too quickly.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, the future of Britain should come first.
 
**Artoria:**
The reason I'm able to do this is because Oberon gave himself up to help me.
 
**Artoria:**
If that was true, my journey would have ended back there.
 
**Artoria:**
Because in the end...I wasn't able to reach Morgan's level.
 
**Artoria:**
If I had beaten her on my own, maybe I'd be proud of myself,
 
**Artoria:**
but the rebels were the ones who defeated Morgan.
 
**Artoria:**
The Round Table Army came from Percival's achievements. The northern fairy army came from Knocknarea's hard work.
 
**Artoria:**
I tried to get the best part at the very end, but I failed miserably!
 
**Artoria:**
I don't really know anything about politics in the first place,
 
**Artoria:**
so I'll just let Knocknarea be the next queen and retire comfortably to my hometown!
 
**Artoria:**
A place where everyone will greet me, saying: “Well done, Child of Prophecy!”
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Well well, the Child of Prophecy is in a good mood! It is your triumphant return from battle, after all~!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
All thanks to Dabinchi! Six top-class apple waters, here you go!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Thanks, Mike. Hey, you don't see many other guests around, do you?
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Red Rab-bit came by earlier and said you all were coming, so you have the place to yourselves!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
If it was known that the Child of Prophecy would be coming, the place would be packed.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Fairies are coming from all over Britain to see the coronation of the next queen.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
You're actually bad with huge crowds, aren't you, Artoria? I know how that feels.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
So I thought it would be easier on you if it was quiet. Hehehe...
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, that's true! Thanks, Mike!
 
**Artoria:**
Now everyone, raise your cups, and let's have a toooaaaast~!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Cheeeeers!|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Wow, a victory toast really is the best! Thanks for your help everyone!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyhow, now that Morgan is gone, there's no further threat of an invasion into pan-human history.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Fairy Kingdom of Britain is at peace. Until the bleaching of the earth is rescinded, anyway.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Once that happens, it remains to be seen whether this Fairy Kingdom of Britain will continue to co-exist with pan-human history, or be rejected by it...
 
**Da Vinci:**
At the very least, the fae won't disappear. I'm also looking at the possibility of emigration using the Storm Border...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Until we return, things will be taken care of by Artoria and Knocknarea.
 
**Da Vinci:**
After Chaldea has taken care of their own errands, our leader will return to greet them both again.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
&mdash;Dabinchi, are you leaving?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, once I've seen the coronation. I've got a lot of work piling up back on the Border.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But I'm free today. Feel free to ask me if there's anything you don't understand.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh yeah, let's work out your business plan for the next few years while we still can!
 
**Da Vinci:**
I swear on my title as a renaissance genius that Mike's will become a hotel or something equally amazing!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
R-really? That does sound amazing! I'll have so many goals again!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Heehee, I'm looking forward to it! Oh, this will be so much fun!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh yeah, Mash. You were talking with Barghest about something.|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Just before we left Camelot. Barghest said&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
I've been entrusted with cleaning up Camelot.
 
**Barghest:**
The reform policies will be the work of Percival and Knocknarea's men,
 
**Barghest:**
but there are some unreasonable ambassadors and officials among them. I'll make them listen to me.
 
**Barghest:**
Spriggan and Aurora have said they will follow the queen designated by the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Barghest:**
It concerns me we haven't heard anything from Muryan, but that's not a major issue.
 
**Mash:**
Understood. I think that's very encouraging.
 
**Barghest:**
Your thanks are unnecessary. This is the least I can do.
 
**Barghest:**
But...why the long face?
 
**Barghest:**
I'm a traitor who betrayed my Lord. A woman without any right to be a knight.
 
**Mash:**
You're wrong. Barghest, you are a fine knight.
 
**Mash:**
Your allegiance to Her Majesty Morgan never once wavered.
 
**Mash:**
On top of that, you concerned yourself with Britain's future and rebelled...a difficult, thankless decision.
 
**Mash:**
I know of one knight who chose such a path. So&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
It warms my heart to see the rebels have accepted you so graciously.
 
**Mash:**
It is the duty of the strong to protect the weak. Take up your sword not for your own sake, but for the sake of the people.
 
**Mash:**
Please, don't look down on yourself so hard, Knight Barghest.
 
**Mash:**
You are a magnificent knight, just as Boggart said you were.
 
**Barghest:**
I see...you watched over him as he passed, did you not?
 
**Barghest:**
What did you think of him...? Was he a man worthy to be lord of Sheffield?
 
**Mash:**
He was a splendid man.
 
**Mash:**
He worried for both Sheffield and Norwich to the very end.
 
**Mash:**
I may be a member of Chaldea,
 
**Mash:**
but I think I'd like to be a knight of Sheffield in the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Mash:**
It's because I've been given so much by everybody that I wish for that.
 
**Barghest:**
I see...that's just like that blockhead of a man. He looked rough, but he was chivalrous to the very end.
 
**Barghest:**
Despite his looks, he was always a ladies' man. Woodwose was no match for him in that department.
 
**Mash:**
I-is that true!? I had no idea Boggart was so popular...!
 
**Barghest:**
Yeah. He wasn't showy, so his words stirred many fairies by falsely engraving themselves into their hearts.
 
**Barghest:**
Even if he never meant to. How do you think he ended up taking 61 wives?
 
**Mash:**
I see&mdash;it may be too late now, but I deeply and quietly understand.
 
**Barghest:**
And same to you, Galahad. No, I suppose I should call you Mash.
 
**Barghest:**
After I sort out Camelot's affairs, I'll be facing a military tribunal&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
Your words just now will be enough to endure a century of punishment.
 
**Barghest:**
You have my thanks, knight of pan-human history. A true Knight of the Round Table, you female knight unburdened by gloom...
 
**Barghest:**
If I could...I'd like to meet another Knight of the Round Table someday.
 
**Mash:**
I-is that so? Then...if you could choose, which one would it be?
 
**Barghest:**
I-I don't know...
 
**Barghest:**
Sir Gawain...would probably be a bad idea. My emotions would be a mess if he stood before me.
 
**Barghest:**
I suppose Sir Palamedes, Sir Tristan&mdash;and Sir Kay was rumored to be tall, so him too.
 
**Mash:**
In that case, you've already met one of them. Senpai told me.
 
**Mash:**
The knight who stopped you at the farm. That was Sir Tristan.
 
**Barghest:**
Wh&ndash;!?
 
**Barghest:**
I mean, um...really? Tristan the Lamenting...?
 
**Mash:**
Yes. Perhaps he didn't make that much of an impression on you...
 
**Barghest:**
No, such unbelievable transcendence, such finesse... how could I forget...
 
**Barghest:**
(What have I done..!? How could I atone for this...!?)
 
**Mash:**
You faced him in single combat as a knight should, so I think Tristan would have approved.
 
**Mash:**
But...why are you so attached to the Knights of the Round Table, Barghest?
 
**Mash:**
I feel like it's not just because of the Gift that Her Majesty bestowed on you.
 
**Barghest:**
That's true...As a fellow lady knight, I suppose I can confess it to you.
 
**Barghest:**
They're strong, first of all, so it's only natural.
 
**Barghest:**
What I admired about the Knights of the Round Table was the direction their stories took.
 
**Barghest:**
They faced many problems, but in the end they came together and chose the way of protecting their country.
 
**Barghest:**
They were strong and just, taking on the wishes of the people, defeating evil that threw their world into chaos, and demonstrated righteousness.
 
**Barghest:**
That ending, the way things should be, that saved me. I hoped that it could be the same here in the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Barghest:**
But...in the end, it was something I could never do. You and your friends took my place instead.
 
**Barghest:**
I want you to let the Foreign Magus know.
 
**Barghest:**
Tell {(M)him/(F)her} that I am thankful for your supporting our world...no, thank you for supporting the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Barghest:**
I may be a knight burdened by dishonor, but I owe {(M)him/(F)her} a debt of gratitude.
 
**Barghest:**
Should you ever need my horn, I shall stand by your side. Wherever that may be&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Barghest said something like that...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We have to live up to her expectations too...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes. It's unfortunate we first met her as an enemy.
 
**Mash:**
From now on, I'd like to work together with her as a trusted ally.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
What are you talking about? She may be all ready to be sent to the gaol, but Knocknarea won't allow it.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Barghest knows more about the fairies of Camelot than anyone else.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's the kind of support Knocknarea's going to need most of all right now.
 
**Artoria:**
Are you going somewhere, Grimm?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah, just taking care of some minor business. Going to check how Knocknarea's doing.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The northern fairies have never been to Salisbury or the cathedral before, you know?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The coronation ceremony is tomorrow morning. I think I'll be pretty busy getting them to the point where they're ready for it.
 
**Artoria:**
I see. I guess you do have the knowledge of the previous Grimm.
 
**Artoria:**
Give her my regards too. After all, it's that brat's big day.
 
**Muryan:**
...&mdash;Not here ......&mdash;Not here either.
 
**Muryan:**
It's absurd...finished so easily...no...
 
**Muryan:**
Is anyone there...? Is anyone there...?
 
**Muryan:**
Is there anybody left alive...?
 
**Muryan:**
If you're here...I'll ■ ■ ■ ■ you. So please answer, okay?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Lady Muryan...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
There's nothing left in there. Isn't it about time you forgot about that thing?
 
**Muryan:**
Who's there!?
 
**Muryan:**
Oh, well look who it is. How long have you been there, Koyanskaya? Did you just get back?
 
**Muryan:**
Wait there, I have to go wash my hands. I feel disgusted for some reason. Isn't that strange?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
...
 
**Muryan:**
There. There. There!
 
**Muryan:**
You can't run to the woods. You can't run anywhere. You can't, can't, CAN'T, CAN'T!
 
**Muryan:**
Get crushed! Run back to the start in disgrace and collapse in your own tears!
 
**Muryan:**
Hahaha. Hahahaha. Hahahahahaha!
 
**Muryan:**
Ha&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
&mdash;What nonsense! How is this fun!?
 
**Muryan:**
Disgusting! Disgusting! Disgusting! What was so fun about all this!?
 
**Muryan:**
Answer me, you bugs! You started this, didn't you!?
 
**Muryan:**
Why did you do this!? Why are you begging for help!?
 
**Muryan:**
Then, then&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
Why didn't you help us back then!
 
**Muryan:**
Who's there!?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
My apologies for disturbing you, Lady Muryan. Did I startle you?
 
**Muryan:**
Oh. When did you come in here? I haven't seen you around lately, when did you get back?
 
**Muryan:**
Listen to this, Koyanskaya. I've thought of an interesting idea for revenge.
 
**Muryan:**
Pest extermination using my game board. A bug cage you can never escape.
 
**Muryan:**
It will take hundreds of years to build an open world to house all of the Fang Clan...
 
**Muryan:**
But I am the princess encountered under the butterbur. The most patient fairy in the Wing Clan.
 
**Muryan:**
I'll definitely finish it. No matter how much work it takes.
 
**Muryan:**
That way, revenge will feel oh-so-sweet.
 
**Muryan:**
I'll give my entire life for just that one joyous moment!
 
**Muryan:**
There's nothing strange about it! There's nothing empty about it!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Lady Muryan...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
(...you're already...)
 
**Muryan:**
So, how are things in Camelot? Has Her Majesty really been defeated?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
She has. Her Majesty has departed, and the rebels now control the castle.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Tomorrow, the coronation ceremony for the new queen will be held.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Gloucester too, will eventually come under suspicion.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Such as where the missing Fang Clan went&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
If that were to become known, your position would be in serious jeopardy, Lady Muryan.
 
**Muryan:**
Hm? The Fang Clan is gone?
 
**Muryan:**
Well, whatever. Camelot is more important right now.
 
**Muryan:**
Artoria giving up the throne so easily was unexpected.
 
**Muryan:**
Now there's no chance of the two of them destroying each other in a falling-out. Rather anticlimactic, but&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
It's good to have a new queen chosen so soon. We don't have much time left before the Great Calamity appears.
 
**Muryan:**
Knocknarea is a direct descendant of Mab. That being the case, she knows how important the throne is.
 
**Muryan:**
I'll contact her, and ally Gloucester with her.
 
**Muryan:**
Knocknarea can be overthrown after the Great Calamity is taken care of.
 
**Muryan:**
First, we have to ensure Britain survives.
 
**Muryan:**
After that, I will invite our enemies from pan-human history...the humans of Chaldea, into my garden.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Oh my. Lady Muryan, you plan to wage war on Chaldea!?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I was sure you had zero interest in them.
 
**Muryan:**
That was never the case...
 
**Muryan:**
I can see that pan-human history will become an obstacle to the Fairy Kingdom, but more importantly...
 
**Muryan:**
They're your enemy, aren't they? Then they're my enemy as well. Let's get rid of them.
 
**Muryan:**
But first things first, Knocknarea.
 
**Muryan:**
As soon as she's crowned the new queen, have the Round Table Army removed from Camelot.
 
**Muryan:**
Do not give a Holy Lance to Chaldea. All of them are the property of the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Muryan:**
Could I ask you to carry a missive of that sort to Knocknarea?
 
**Muryan:**
Normally I'd ask Oberon to do this sort of thing, but he's fallen out of contact lately...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Of course. I will attend the ceremony in your stead.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
But what will you do now, Lady Muryan?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
You've shut yourself up in your room for long enough... it's not good for you.
 
**Muryan:**
...?
 
**Muryan:**
I have matters to look into. The truth that Queen Morgan kept hidden...
 
**Muryan:**
How exactly did Her Majesty protect us from the Great Calamity? And what the Great Calamity is in the first place.
 
**Muryan:**
If I order a book from Camelot, there's always an answer.
 
**Muryan:**
So long as it's written in a book, there's nothing I can't uncover.
 
**Muryan:**
I swear on my title of “princess under the butterburs,”  I will uncover the truth of this.
 
## Intermission 
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Artoria gives her regards to the brat. She's looking forward to your coronation.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Oh, is she? I can't say I'm happy to be congratulated by a gutless coward who gave up at the last second.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You're still mad about that?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Artoria didn't run away from her rivalry with you.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
If anything, it's the other way around. She willingly stepped back so you wouldn't get sucked into the mission of the Fairies of Paradise.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I know that! That's why I'm not even more pissed off!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Walking off the stage for my sake?
 
**Knocknarea:**
So she just does something amazing that nobody will ever know, and runs off getting to say she saved the world?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Aaah, geez, I can't believe this! I won't let her! She's as bad as Morgan!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Just watch. When I take the throne, the first thing I'll do is start a hunt for the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'll find you wherever you are, and then I'll invade your “Paradise!”
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
What the hell? If anyone's as bad as Morgan here, it's you.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
But if you really mean to fight her, you'd better be prepared for it.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
To go against the mission of Paradise is to go to war with pan-human history.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You'll bring an entirely different war to a Britain that's only just found peace.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I don't care, bring it on. I don't intend to coexist with pan-human history.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I don't think I'll be as extreme as Morgan was, but that's still “another country,” isn't it?
 
**Knocknarea:**
I couldn't be happier there's another land to invade.
 
**Knocknarea:**
My purpose is to “rule.” I want treasure enough to fill both my hands, not just one.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The bigger the world, the more the magical energy in my heart gets fired up!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You're using words you only just learned, so you must be in a good mood. In that case, I won't stop you.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Whatever the event, rebuilding the Fairy Kingdom will take time. During that time, Chaldea will have achieved their goals.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Fujimaru is leaving. You okay with that?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Yes. It'll be a brief farewell...but isn't that destiny?
 
**Knocknarea:**
When I invade pan-human history, I'll become a better queen than Morgan ever was.
 
**Knocknarea:**
When she sees that I've become the greatest fairy on earth, she'll have no choice but to go along with me, right?
 
**Knocknarea:**
That's right. I wanted her to be my counselor, but it couldn't be helped.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It sucks that she let this chance go. But there will definitely be another.
 
**Knocknarea:**
After all, I'm going to become an extremely wicked queen and invade pan-human history.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Me and Fujimaru will meet again. As rivals!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You get what you want no matter what, huh? How very like you.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Just like Camelot's throne. “No matter what, it must remain unharmed.”
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Something like that is normally just ornamental. But you insisted on it.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Just like how Morgan never left it. You know what that thing is?
 
**Knocknarea:**
All right...you're Grimm the Sage, so I guess I can tell you.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Morgan's throne is the lynchpin of the Fairy Kingdom, and what maintains the cycle of fairies.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The cog that turns all those lives that were lost at the end of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Knocknarea:**
After completing her pilgrimage, Tonelico founded a false Round Table in defiance of her “mission”.
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;The Summoner's Throne.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Whosoever joins themselves to that throne becomes the Master of all fairies in Britain.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Morgan was alone and desperate, so she summoned the fairies of the Fairy Kingdom and maintained their lives in order to survive.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Queen Mab learned this in the year 400 of the Queen's Calendar, during her last decisive battle.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Mab, the clan heads, and some upper-class fairies were the only ones to not succumb to the Great Calamity at the end of the Fairy Calendar.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Mab wasn't one of the fairies resurrected by Morgan, so she had no reason to obey Her Majesty.
 
**Knocknarea:**
But neither could she fight Morgan, who went that far to keep Britain alive.
 
**Knocknarea:**
And so, Mab and Morgan forged a secret pact.
 
**Knocknarea:**
“If you, Morgan, should grow weak and your strength ever fail you, the King's Clan shall succeed you.”
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I see. “I'll take care of the rest, so you can go do what you want,” huh?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Yeah. A sort of friendship...or something, I guess. Anyway, Mab settled into retirement in Edinburgh.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Producing an heir for when Morgan grew weak&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
That was the arrangement between them. The mission I inherited from my predecessor.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I am the one born to be the next Queen.
 
**Knocknarea:**
No matter what I do, no matter how I live, that's the mission I have to accomplish first.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It pisses me off that it happened in such a half-assed way, though!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Fine then. As soon as the coronation ceremony is over, I'll sit right on the throne and pick up where Morgan left off!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Well...there was no other way from the start.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'm the only one whose Saint Graph can reforge the contract with all of Britain's fairies.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Artoria just can't do it. It couldn't be helped, could it?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah. It's just like Ainsel said.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The Child of Prophecy will pave the way, and then the “true king” will appear.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The Child of Prophecy and the true king were different fairies all this time. That prophecy was talking about the both of you.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
If you know that much, then there's nothing left for me to tell you.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
See you around, Knocknarea.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
This Lostbelt and pan-human history&mdash;they're mutually exclusive, but I suppose we can forget that for a few days.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Tomorrow's finally your coronation day. You have my blessing as the Sage.
 
**Narration:**
In the end, it became an ocean. In the beginning, there was only an ocean.
 
**Narration:**
The meteor passed over, civilization vanished, and all of the land was gathered as resources and became an ocean.
 
**Narration:**
A mistake occurred on this planet, and everything disappeared.
 
**Narration:**
This is the voice of an island on its deathbed. Even now, it resounds with the agonizing breath of someone who outlived death.
 
**Fairies on their way to the Coronation:**
Salisbury, Salisbury, venerable Salisbury!
 
**Fairies on their way to the Coronation:**
A new queen and a new calendar!
 
**Fairies on their way to the Coronation:**
The Child of Prophecy? Or the Child of the Queen?
 
**Fairies on their way to the Coronation:**
Who knows which one it will be, but who cares so long as they manage things?
 
**Fairies on their way to the Coronation:**
Hurry up with the coronation! Goodbye to the merciless Queen Morgan!
 
**Fairies on their way to the Coronation:**
Hm? Wait everyone, look over there. There's a single Mors up on the hill, looking this way.
 
**Fairies on their way to the Coronation:**
Just one of them isn't scary. If it's far away it's not scary.
 
**Fairies on their way to the Coronation:**
Britain is going to get a fresh start. What will our new queen make of this country?
 
**Narration:**
The critical point is almost here.
 
**Narration:**
The Mors will outnumber the fairies. Thanks to a suitable sacrifice, the god has awoken.
 
**???:**
Upon reflection, the reality is that there is no way it can be reclaimed.
 
**???:**
Being aware, but aggravating it; realizing, but doing so too late.
 
**???:**
Those who cry foul shall with foulness be contained.
 
**???:**
Who will take responsibility? It's natural. No one will shoulder it.
 
**???:**
As such, there can be no cure.
 
**???:**
You know how they say “a day after the fair”? That is exactly the case.
 
**???:**
At the very least, when this all comes to a close, I'll offer you something grand.
 
## Section 25: The End ～Coronation Ceremony～ 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Goooood morning~! Is everybody reeeeeeady~!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's coronation day! Let's get to the cathedral before it gets too crowded!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
We've got special seats as guests of honor, though.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The ceremony itself should be over in an hour. Have you thought about what you're all going to do afterwards?
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Da Vinci, and myself are going to wait for Percival to arrive.
 
**Mash:**
We're hoping we can help with the transport of the Holy Lance.
 
**Artoria:**
I'm...going to go report about our successful journey to the Welsh forest.
 
**Artoria:**
After that...hm...
 
**Artoria:**
I think I'd like to help with the recovery effort in Londinium until it settles down.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Not a bad plan. Once I've seen this through, my job will finally be done.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I saw Artoria's journey through, and what's more, my job of defeating Morgan has wrapped up too.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I can leave Britain without any regrets.
 
**Artoria:**
Huh? You're going back home, Muramasa!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Of course I am. I'm not some vagrant, you know. I'm still under contract, after all.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Plus, I still have one oddball coworker to deal with. I can't quit without a reason.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We'd like to scout you ourselves, but I get that you're not the type to decide that based on pros and cons.
 
**Da Vinci:**
“While we're in Britain we won't fight each other.”  As agreements go, it worked pretty well for us.
 
**Da Vinci:**
By the way...has Habetrot still not come out of her room?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah. She's drowsy, so she's sleeping it off. She said not to worry about it and to just go to the coronation.
 
**Mash:**
Uhm...shouldn't we check on her one more time just to be sure?
 
**Mash:**
I'll&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, I'll go myself.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You guys go on ahead.
 

---

 
**Morgan:**
You chose to be a dream. A path which exists separate from my Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Morgan:**
The short time between her arrival in Britain and when she's spirited away by the Water Mirror, that's the period wherein you are permitted to be active.
 
**Morgan:**
Remember this, Totrot...
 
**Morgan:**
When the morning lark cries, you must wake from your dream.
 
**Habetrot:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Habetrot, are you awake?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You okay, Habenyan...?
 

---

 
**Habetrot lying down:**
Whoa, you came all the way here to check on me? Aren't you courteous, Fujimaru!
 
**Habetrot lying down:**
Hey, everyone's waiting for you outside! Quit worrying about me and just go.
 
**Habetrot lying down:**
I'm just worn out is all. I'll snap out of it soon enough.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see. Well, see you later then.|
 
**Habetrot lying down:**
Yeah, see you. Make sure you say your goodbyes!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Still...are you really okay?
 
**Habetrot lying down:**
What do you mean? There's nothing to be worried about.
 
**Habetrot lying down:**
You think I'm hiding something, huh? Like, could I actually be some sort of fairy world bigshot!?
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No...it's not like we actually know anything about your past...|
 

---

 
**Habetrot lying down:**
Right? Then there's nothing to worry about.
 
**Habetrot lying down:**
If even one person knew about my situation, I'd be in serious trouble.
 
**Habetrot lying down:**
So you shouldn't try to find out. I just have a few more things to take care of.
 
**Habetrot lying down:**
But I appreciate you asking. It's too early to say goodbye yet, but thanks.
 
**Habetrot lying down:**
Get along with Mash now, Fujimaru! You'd have made a pretty good-looking {(M)groom/(F)bride} too!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Leaving...leaving...I see...Dabinchi's going away...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
But where is she going?
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
What is the outside world? What could be out there... beyond Britain?
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
If she goes there, will Dabinchi's illness be cured? If her body gets better, then it's a good thing!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
..... .....uuu....uuuuu...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
It's awful...awful...it's too awful...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Everyday is fun now, so why would you say that...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Don't do this. Don't take Dabinchi away from me...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
If Dabinchi goes away, I'll be all alone again...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
How can Dabinchi stay...
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
We made it to the cathedral! There's upper-class fairies everywhere you look!
 
**Artoria:**
Aurora, Spriggan, and all the other famous ones are upstairs in the VIP section!
 
**Artoria:**
But we won't lose to them.
 
**Artoria:**
I may have given up the throne, but we were the star players in the capture of Camelot!
 
**Artoria:**
We'll definitely get the front row...the front row... uh, is already all full?
 
**Artoria:**
Let's see, we're seated...on the first floor... all the way in the back...
 
**Artoria:**
The seats for the friends of friends...so that's where she placed us, huh...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now, now.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's so we don't stand out.
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Good, you all made it as well.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Percival!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're not in Camelot!?
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Yes. I had planned to be, but Lady Barghest insisted.
 
**Mash:**
“How would it look if the Round Table's commander didn't appear? It's fine, just leave this to me,”
 
**Percival:**
Those were her exact words. She also gave her regards to Mash.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That sounds like her, she is a very considerate guardian knight. I'm glad you're here to witness this event as well.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, but how is the removal of the Holy Lance going? Smoothly, I hope?
 
**Da Vinci:**
If it's too difficult, I'll go to Camelot to assist.
 
**Percival:**
Please, don't worry. All is going well.
 
**Percival:**
We expect it will be finished by noon today, and it will be transported to Salisbury by tomorrow night.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's great news. I'm not sure if a Holy Lance made by Morgan herself is something we can handle,
 
**Da Vinci:**
but it'll be great reference material for a Divine Construct. You've really saved us.
 
**Artoria:**
Quiet down, everyone! Knocknarea's here!
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whoa...she's beautiful...!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, she's so beautiful she's grabbing all the attention in the room!
 
**Mash:**
Being so sparkling and majestic fits her well, right Artoria?
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;It does! Damn you, Knocknarea!
 
**Artoria:**
It frustrates me, but she is the best!
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;
 
**Spriggan:**
Thank you all for coming. It may only be temporary,
 
**Spriggan:**
but as the representative for the six clans, I, Spriggan, shall proceed with the coronation ceremony.
 
**Spriggan:**
The new sovereign of Britain. Our representative, who will build a more prosperous future.
 
**Spriggan:**
Lady Knocknarea, of the King's Clan. Please proceed to the cathedral's altar and take your seat on the throne of coronation.
 
**Knocknarea:**
...
 
**Mash:**
It's begun...what a solemn atmosphere...
 
**Mash:**
With the blessings of the six clans on that crown, Knocknarea will become queen...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, the ceremony itself seems simple enough.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The groundwork has probably already been taken care of, and anyone who disagreed&mdash;oh?
 
**Cathedral Guard:**
Everyone, your cups.
 
**Cathedral Guard:**
This is to share in the joy when the blessings are complete.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Wow, alcohol...!)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
(Senpai, are you going to drink that?)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I can't drink, but I can at least pretend to, right?)|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
(Understood...! I'll follow your example!)
 
**Artoria:**
(Me too...I'm not really used to alcohol...)
 
**Da Vinci:**
(Is that so? Hmm, then I'll do the same.)
 
**Percival:**
(I'm a little bit of a lightweight, so...)
 
**Senji Muramasa & Grimm:**
 
(Guess I have no choice...I'll read the room and hold myself back...)
 
**Spriggan:**
Now, in celebration of the birth of a new queen, I bestow the sign of my blessing upon you.
 
**Spriggan:**
The New Queen, Knocknarea. Please give your vows for your diligence and your fairness, your tolerance and your purity.
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;Very well.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As one of the “fairies of Britain”, I hereby vow to remain fair.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As leader of the “northern fairies”, I hereby vow to remain diligent.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As the one entrusted with this island by the Child of Prophecy, I hereby swear to believe in the righteousness of coexistence.
 
**Knocknarea:**
As daughter of the Great Queen Mab, I hereby vow to retain my purity for the rest of my&mdash;
 
**J：???:**
&mdash;Objection.
 
**J：???:**
We assert that not one thing in that declaration is worth believing.
 
**J：???:**
Knocknarea is a villain. The northern fairies are not needed in Britain.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Who dares!? Show yourselves!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Wh&mdash;you are...King's Clan&mdash;my subjects&mdash;
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
We accuse. We accuse.
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Knocknarea does not deserve to rule. We shall now reveal the atrocities carried out in the north!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
The tyranny of the north has been terrible.
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Whosoever Knocknarea shares her blood with becomes her slave, unable to defy her!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
All their actions are restricted, military service is compulsory, and your very status as a “fairy” is taken away!
 
**K：King's Clanmember Convert:**
That's not all! Both me and my brother had the Mors sickness!
 
**K：King's Clanmember Convert:**
We heard that if you went to Edinburgh you could be cured, so we became subjects of Knocknarea!
 
**K：King's Clanmember Convert:**
But what I saw couldn't be called a cure at all!
 
**K：King's Clanmember Convert:**
All it did was transfer the curse to a fairy with no value and force them to die!
 
**K：King's Clanmember Convert:**
I managed to survive, but...
 
**K：King's Clanmember Convert:**
My brother who came with me was forced to take the curse of who knows how many fairies.
 
**K：King's Clanmember Convert:**
Not only did he become a hideous monster, but he served as a slave in Knocknarea's Giant Corps!
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;What's wrong with that? Those fairies had already given their consent!
 
**Knocknarea:**
They were near death, so they dedicated themselves to saving their brethren. And moreover, it was thanks to them that Morgan was defeated!
 
**Knocknarea:**
They deserved to be rewarded for their dedication. It's not one-sided exploitation!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Then&mdash;what lies in the bowels of the Queen's City? How can you explain that horrifying contraption?
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;you&mdash;
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Everyone gathered here, please listen!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Hear now the betrayal of Britain concealed by Queen Mab and Knocknarea.
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Was Queen Mab ever really dead in the first place!? No, she remains alive.
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Her form has been changed to that of the Queen's City, Edinburgh.
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
She turned her own corpse into a city and even now remains “active”!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
What is this “activity”, you ask? It's something horrible...
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Mab ate the corpses of fairies to expand the city. Simultaneously, she intended to create a stronger version of herself.
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
And the proof of that success is Knocknarea! Knocknarea, the lady of the tomb herself!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Now you understand why the lands of the north don't expand.
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
It's been 1,500 years since the founding of Edinburgh!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Fairy corpses are supposed to make up the lands of Britain, yet...this woman was made from all of them!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
If that is not betrayal towards Britain, then what is!? “King's Clan,” how laughable!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
To Mab and Knocknarea, we fairies of Britain are nothing more than prey!
 
**Knocknarea:**
How can you call it a betrayal when you know not what Mab thought...!?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Without a fairy strong enough to join all fairies, it would be impossible to maintain the Fairy Kingdom!
 
**Knocknarea:**
And if you know that much, Mab's gone from being the Queen's City to...!
 
**Knocknarea:**
Very well, I'll tell you!
 
**Knocknarea:**
There's a reason why the once ruined “fairies of Britain” still exist.
 
**Knocknarea:**
What we inherited from Morgan was this land's true—guh&mdash;!?
 
**Northern Fairies in Attandence:**
Lady Knocknarea!? Oh no, Lady Knocknarea's coughing up blood...!
 
**Northern Fairies in Attandence:**
Arrest these insolent dogs! What have the guards been doin&mdash;urgh!?
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
They've collapsed, they've collapsed! Now that her crimes have been exposed, she can't bear them anymore!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Now, guardsmen! Judgement on Knocknarea! Judgement on the false queen!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
We can't have a northern fairy for a queen! Because there's one much more worthy!

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ah&mdash;!|

**Fujimaru 2:**
Artoria!
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
What the hell are you all doing&mdash;!?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Knocknarea:**
As soon as I drank the contents of my cup, I calmly realized what was happening.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The alcohol served had been laced with poison.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It had likely been mixed into the cups served to me, the northern fairies, and Artoria's group.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It didn't affect me. If my body couldn't withstand poison like this, I would've succumbed long ago.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It would have been bad for Artoria and Fujimaru, though.
 
**Knocknarea:**
When I snuck a glance at them in the back row, none of them had touched their cups for some reason.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It might have simply been a coincidence, but that was their saving grace.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I don't think Artoria would have noticed it, so maybe Fujimaru suggested it.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The fairies of the north are my oldest subjects. Their connections to me are strong.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If I'm calm in the face of this, then my subjects will endure it too. As such, I feigned ignorance and proceeded with the coronation ceremony.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I didn't want to be interrupted by my stingy anxiety.
 
**Knocknarea:**
When the Great Calamity could strike at any time, there is no more leeway for a king to be absent.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I didn't want to think about who served this, it wouldn't benefit me, but&mdash;
 
**King's Clanmember:**
We assert that not one thing in that declaration is worth believing.
 
**King's Clanmember:**
Knocknarea is a villain. The northern fairies are not needed in Britain.
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;Even so, when I saw the faces of the fairies who opposed me, I knew things would turn bad.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The enemy had already prepared for this by having my clansmen be the ones to denounce me, rather than another clan.
 
**Knocknarea:**
My body, which had been alright until moments ago, began to numb. My fingers clenching, my throat and insides burning.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The objections of these so-called “king's clan” were not occurring just here. It was happening all over Britain at the same time.
 
**Knocknarea:**
Loyalty is my greatest weapon, but also my biggest weakness.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If a fairy who once shared their power with the “king” separates, my power would decrease by that same amount.
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;I found myself having been reduced to not even half.
 
**Knocknarea:**
The poison that moments ago was harmless now spread violently, and even my oldest subjects began to collapse.
 
**Knocknarea:**
A guard's spear, usually no more harmful than a comb through your hair, enters through my abdomen and pierces through my back.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I guess I'm beaten...I'm still just a little girl.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I wonder if it's because I finally got to wear the dress I always wanted to? I guess I got too carried away in the moment.
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
Eep! The Child of Prophecy has attacked the cathedral's guards!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
I knew it, Knocknarea and the Child of Prophecy were working together!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
The descendant of the northern fairies and the Fairy of Paradise! How shameless! What a truly awful matched set!
 
**King's Clanmembers:**
They're both outsiders to Britain, and someone needs to hurry up and get rid...Aaaah! What was that!?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Shut up and leave. Or die if you can't. I won't say it twice.
 
**Artoria:**
Knocknarea&mdash;Knocknarea!
 
**Artoria:**
This is bad&mdash;stay with me, Knocknarea!
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
What's happening, the bleeding won't stop&mdash;her wound won't close!
 
**Artoria:**
Shouldn't you recover easily from wounds like this? What's wrong with you, Knocknarea!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
The amount of magical energy her body produces is decreasing...? It's as if her Saint Graph is being reduced little by little...
 
**Da Vinci:**
As if...she's being reduced more and more to her childhood state...?
 
**Artoria:**
Knocknarea! Wake up, Knocknarea!
 
**Artoria:**
You're about to become queen. Isn't that what you've worked so hard for!?
 
**Artoria:**
Get up and laugh it off like you always do, you idiot!
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;Huh? Oh no, did I fall asleep?
 
**Artoria:**
Knocknarea...! Oh good, you woke up! Just wait, we'll get you some help...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Ah...no, there's no need. I'm used to this. I'm fine.
 
**Knocknarea:**
But...how strange. That face of yours...I know it very well...
 
**Knocknarea:**
When I have...a hard time...I always thought of it. We make a good pair as...as...as rivals, don't we...
 
**Knocknarea:**
But it's strange...I'm sorry...I know you...
 
**Knocknarea:**
But not...not your name...I somehow...don't know...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Where...is this? I am...I am...Knock...narea...
 
**Knocknarea:**
I have...an important...mission&mdash;mission &mdash;mission? What is...
 
**Knocknarea:**
With each heartbeat...I'm forgetting more and more&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
Ah...I see...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Because I gave it away to so many others...
 
**Knocknarea:**
It seems...the intelligence I came from...has long since vanished....
 
**Artoria:**
Wh&mdash;what are you saying, Knocknarea? You gave everyone...
 
**Artoria:**
You shared...everything? For all of them? For Britain?
 
**Artoria:**
Your magical energy. Your miracles. Your intellect. You exhausted them all before everyone came here&mdash;?
 
**Knocknarea:**
Ah...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Um...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Sorry...don't...cry, whoever you are.
 
**Knocknarea:**
I...still...know you. Because...you were...always in my thoughts.
 
**Knocknarea:**
If you follow that light, you will find your way home. No matter what path you take, don't waver&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Stop saying things like that! Stop wasting your breath!
 
**Artoria:**
I mean, we still haven't had our rematch yet, have we!? At least fight me before you go!
 
**Artoria:**
Weren't you going to fall in love after you became queen!? You haven't even gotten started yet!
 
**Artoria:**
So please, Knocknarea&mdash;please...!
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;No. This too is my...worth...the night sky with .
 
**Knocknarea:**
Love...I had a little taste of it. It was very&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
Very wonderful, a comforting feeling. When this ceremony is over&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
I'll definitely make them mine. Fufu. It's going to be even harder than becoming a queen.
 
**Knocknarea:**
It's okay. The me in the other world...would have known lots of love.
 
**Knocknarea:**
&mdash;That's odd.  name...I wonder what it was?
 
**Knocknarea:**
On my grave...rather than my name&mdash;
 
**Knocknarea:**
It should definitely be...a name like a flower.
 
**Artoria:**
Wait&mdash;wait, Knocknarea. Don't go. Don't just quit while you're ahead.
 
**Artoria:**
It's because of you...because of people like you... I was able to...
 
**Artoria:**
If even you go, I'll...
 
**Knocknarea:**
You're...lying. You...can't lose...
 
**Knocknarea:**
Even...if you're left alone...you'll always...look for the star...
 
**Artoria:**
Knocknarea...is dead.

**Fujimaru 1:**

**Senji Muramasa:**
The guards have put their weapons away. The attending fairies have all run off too.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
This was probably Spriggan's doing...or maybe not. He ran off in a panic as well.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
There's a lot of noise outside. Sounds more like people killing each other than an argument.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I thought that fairies don't get into fights unless they're in the military.
 
**Percival:**
It's the residents of Salisbury trying to purge the northern fairies who came here...I think.
 
**Percival:**
I don't know exactly how effective that testimony against her before was,
 
**Percival:**
but Knocknarea isn't around to stop the conflict anymore.
 
**Percival:**
The southern fairies now have casus belli to attack Edinburgh.
 
**Percival:**
And the northern fairies, still acting as the King's Clan, will resist them in order to avenge Knocknarea.
 
**Percival:**
If this keeps going, Britain will fall into civil war again... how foolish...
 
**Mash:**
Yes...They were supposed to enter a new age, under a great ruler...
 
**Mash:**
This is just like the time at Londinium's coronation, and&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Just like...that time...?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Sorry, but we don't have time to talk about this. The cathedral is completely surrounded. We need to deal with this instead.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
There's a bunch of guards spoiling for a fight outside. If we stay here we're done for.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hah!? Why!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't mean...they think Artoria...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...planned the murder of the queen of the north after she conquered Camelot.
 
**Artoria:**
Then I guess I'm next. I don't know what I'll be charged with, though.
 
**Artoria:**
Probably something along the lines of “colluding with the queen of the north to conquer Britain,” or something.
 
**Artoria:**
No...
 
**Artoria:**
The fairies of Britain would love to see my kind dead.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
No. Whoever poisoned the drinks had no idea about the mission of the Fairies of Paradise.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
If they did, they wouldn't have killed Knocknarea.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
She's the only one who could have saved Britain... or rather, the fairies of Britain.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
And now, they've squandered their own last hope, though they don't know it yet.
 
**Percival:**
...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
All right. So what are you gonna do, Artoria? You gonna stay here with Knocknarea?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Or do you want to get started on “what's next?”
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I'm not some ogre. I'll respect whatever you choose, for now.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
"What's next"...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The pilgrimage is over, though...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Coral:**
That's enough of that, Child of Prophecy, Foreign Magus.  Lay down your weapons and surrender.
 
**Coral:**
You are charged with the murder of Lady Knocknarea.
 
**Coral:**
Not only have you disrupted the coronation, but you murdered the guards who tried to stop you.
 
**Coral:**
Many fairies have testified to this.
 
**Coral:**
As the one in charge of Salisbury's safety, I am here to arrest and imprison you.
 
**L：Knight of Salisbury:**
Imprisonment? What are you saying, Lady Coral? The nature of their crime is obvious.
 
**L：Knight of Salisbury:**
The Child of Prophecy who deceived us. The untrustworthy Foreign Magus.
 
**L：Knight of Salisbury:**
And the seditionist, Percival of the Round Table Army. These three cannot be allowed to live.
 
**L：Knight of Salisbury:**
Let's cut them down here and put their heads on display in the square.
 
**Coral:**
No. Testimony is just that. It does not constitute fact.
 
**Coral:**
I will hear the truth of what happened from {(M)him/(F)her}. This is the way of the Wind Clan, as we value impartiality...
 
**Coral:**
What are you doing!?
 
**Q：Knight of Salisbury:**
Let's do it. Don't get sloppy just because we outnumber them.
 
**Q：Knight of Salisbury:**
These are the guys who fought Morgan and survived. They're probably tougher than those Londinium soldiers.
 
**O：Knight of Salisbury:**
Resist if you like, but that's the same as admitting your guilt.
 
**O：Knight of Salisbury:**
Come along quietly and the other fairies will live. Either everyone can die, or just the three of you.
 
**O：Knight of Salisbury:**
You're free to choose&mdash;
 
**O：Knight of Salisbury:**
I-impossible...! This was custom-made mythril armor&mdash;!?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Shut up. We don't have time for this either, we're not following your script.
 
**Coral:**
Y...y...you...laid a hand on the guards again&mdash;
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
If you want to run, do so. I'm not the type to burn someone who seems like a decent sort...
 
**Mash:**
Cu Chulainn!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You blocked my attack...!
 
**Mash:**
Of course! The sword of Sir Lancelot could never be used for a surprise attack!
 
**Coral:**
Mélusine...!? You were sent here!?
 
**Coral:**
So...then...these disturbances...they called you...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Be silent, Coral. I'm not here to protect you.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
My task is to neutralize both the Child of Prophecy and the forces of Chaldea.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The rest is your job.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You can turn them all into rabbits and strangle them to death, throw them into prison, or whatever you want.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Right...but, you shouldn't go outside for the next few hours.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Fighting has broken out all over the city. If you get caught up in it, you'll die.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
And now Lancelot's here, huh...? We might be able to break through with all of us, but...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
(Artoria still hasn't recovered. Without her support, one or two of us will definitely...)
 
**Percival:**
No! I can take her on my own!
 
**Percival:**
Everyone, please get outside! Meet me outside the city at the usual place!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
What are...my business is with the Child of Prophecy and Chaldea, it has nothing to do wi&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
No, it has everything to do with me! They're my respected comrades who I've fought alongside!
 
**Percival:**
They might be a Fairy of Paradise and denizens of the outside world,
 
**Percival:**
but even if they're from different worlds, that doesn't change the fact that we support each other!
 
**Percival:**
I'm committed to believing in the right path, and to helping those who believe the same thing!
 
**Percival:**
I will use all my power to support those who would die for it! That is what a knight is. That is what the Round Table is. That&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
That's what I learned in the garden of this cathedral!
 
**Percival:**
I was told to become a knight worthy of the Spear of Selection, to stand in for the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's right...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Even should children be gathered with evil thoughts, there is no need to corrupt their aspirations or how they are.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's how you grew up. I'm very proud of you. But that's why I don't want to lose you here.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Once, six years ago...Once, against Woodwose.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You've used the Spear of Selection twice now. Any more and you&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
That doesn't matter. I always intended to use it against you from the start.
 
**Percival:**
This spear carries the will and bravery of the knight Gareth.
 
**Percival:**
Fairy Knight Lancelot.
 
**Percival:**
If you still bear that name after the death of Her Majesty Morgan, then I will show you no mercy.
 
**Percival:**
If you're going to do it again&mdash;I'll correct that mistake again right here.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...
 
**Percival:**
Phew. That worked better than I thought. I was actually in a cold sweat.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lancelot...withdrew?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You drove her away...with that!?
 

---

 
**Percival:**
Yes. Despite appearances, Sis—Lancelot is actually a kind, compassionate girl.
 
**Percival:**
If you confront her head-on in an argument, she usually backs down, so I bet on that possibility.
 
**Mash:**
(That felt less like an argument and more like she ran off after being scolded, didn't it, Senpai...)
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
She'll likely be back once things settle down here, though. Either way, now is our chance.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Artoria, Fujimaru. Let's break through this encirclement and escape the city.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Percival...you've grown into a splendid knight...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Straightforward, calm, trustworthy...still, I've never seen that side of you before.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
If I think about it, I was the one who taught you all that.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I know...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I know I'm being foolish...I know, but what choice do I have?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Hm? Screams from Salisbury...?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No...it's not just Salisbury. Gloucester. Oxford. Norwich.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I can hear screaming from everywhere...Are those Mors?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
They're not just in the forests and valleys. They've crawled out into the plains and on the highway&mdash;no.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The fairies are turning into Mors on their own...!?
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
News from Salisbury on the Voice of the Wind! Queen Knocknarea has been murdered! Somebody killed her!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Accusation against the King's Clan has increased feelings of opposition towards Edinburgh.
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Fights have broken out between the upper-class fairies and the northern fairies inside the castle!
 
**Barghest:**
What fools, being so incited by baseless rumors... I'll go shut them up! Where are they!?
 
**Barghest:**
Arrest the fairy who distributed the Voice of the Wind! We'll hand down the first dishonorable discharge of the new regime!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Reporting! A swarm of Mors has appeared inside the castle town!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
We have multiple sightings of company-sized groups! There's more than we can deal with on our own!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
What should we do, Representative Commander Lord Barghest!?
 
**Barghest:**
Don't call me that, it makes my horn itch!
 
**Barghest:**
What are you doing allowing Mors inside the city!? Is the main gate still broken!?
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
There's no sign they came in from outside!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
It's an outbreak of Mors from the interior! They're going out from the castle town itself!
 
**Barghest:**
...! &mdash;How's the dismantling of the Holy Lance proceeding!?
 
**Barghest's Soldiers:**
The last report from the team assigned to it was an hour ago!
 
**Barghest's Soldiers:**
Not only that, but all the fairies in the castle are complaining of numbness in their&mdash;their&mdash; the 
 
**Barghest's Soldiers:**
the&mdash;th&mdash;ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt&ndash;
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Dremmond...!? How!? He didn't even touch a Mors!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Ah...whaa&mdash;what is that!? It's coming out of the Great Pit...!
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;What is going on?
 
**Barghest:**
It's not the Mors...it's something fundamentally more horrible&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
Guh&mdash;!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Representative Commander Lord Barghest!?
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Oh no, get away from the terrace! Give me your hand! Keep away from the Great Pit!
 
**Barghest:**
Ugh...no, I can stand on my own! You all need to get out of here!
 
**Barghest:**
The Mors are coming from down there! Soon the castle will be full of them!
 
**Barghest:**
Get out of here and escape to the plains before that happens! Tell that to every Round Table Army soldier!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
U-understood!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
But what about you!? If you escape with the others...
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;Don't concern yourself with me! If I was going to run away, I would have long since done it!
 
**Barghest:**
As of now, we're abandoning Camelot! I shall cover the retreat!
 
**Barghest:**
All you need to think about is staying alive! I won't allow you to die here!
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
Yessir&mdash;! If we have the protection of the Fairy Knight Barghest, we can definitely make it!
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;A fine soldier. The humans of the Round Table Army are all strong in body and mind.
 
**Barghest:**
Gh...!
 
**Barghest:**
I feel hot...has the Mors' poison affected me that much...? No, this is...
 
**Barghest:**
The curse of the Black Dog...Her Majesty kept it sealed, but...
 
**Barghest:**
Now that I'm no longer Gawain, I too will&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
No. Before that, there's something I must do! I have to protect all these fairies and humans on my own...!
 
**Barghest:**
I'll kill all the Mors in the castle! If I can't do that, I'll never be able to face Chaldea again!
 
**Barghest:**
That's right...so long as {(M)he/(F)she} is there, there's hope.
 
**Barghest:**
Emigration...even if it's just a few, Britain's fairies will be saved...
 
**Barghest:**
Adonis, to get away from this&mdash;that's what I've been living for!
 
## Section 26: An End

**Fujimaru 1:**
Haa......haa......!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We made it out of the city somehow......!

**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, thanks to a fight breaking out in the city between the north and the south.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I figured it'd be easy to make our getaway as long as we could shake the cathedral guards, but......
 
**Da Vinci:**
The gates of Salisbury have closed! No, you could say we made it in the nick of time!
 
**Mash:**
Please wait. Habetrot is still in her room at the tavern!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Now that the gates are shut, we can't get past the walls...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Unless we dive down from high up in the sky like Lancelot did.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Don't worry, Habetrot is a tough one, despite her looks. She's used to this sort of infighting.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I'm sure she's ordering Mike around and thoroughly protecting the tavern right about now. We can go pick her up once the frenzy dies down.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You and Habetrot aren't even that close in the first place, no?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
There's no need to be that worried. She'll be fine on her own.
 
**Mash:**
That...may be so, but...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I'm worried about Habetrot too, but we can't afford to rest on our laurels here either.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Artoria is a suspect in the murder of Knocknarea&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No, it was only a matter of time before war broke out between the northern and southern fairies.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We're allied with the northern fairies, so we'd be labelled as an enemy of the six clans along with the Round Table Army.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Percival, you should head back to Londinium while you still can...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Percival? Hey, your mug is all pale, what's wrong?
 
**Percival:**
No...please, don't concern yourselves with me, I'm just a little tired.
 
**Percival:**
I'd like to believe this rioting is limited to Salisbury, but...
 
**Percival:**
As Muramasa has said, the situation requires an urgent response. We need to act fast...
 
**Artoria:**
Nonsense, you need to get treated first, don't you!? You aren't even breathing properly, Percival!
 
**Artoria:**
Good grief, let's borrow a bed from either Gloucester or the village nearby!
 
**Artoria:**
We can worry about things afterwards!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Has Artoria recovered a little?)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I agree, let's find a place to rest right away!
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No, we've got some major cleanup to do before that. All this noise attracted the Mors here.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's smooth sailing compared to how bad it is in Salisbury, though. Let's take care of this quickly and&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Hold on, these numbers aren't normal. What's happening!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Mash, Da Vinci! Take Percival with you and run! Get to that forest over there!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Grimm, Fujimaru, Artoria! Let's do this, brace yourselves!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We'll be fine if we can hold out for two minutes! After that, we'll run for the woods too!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
T-that was absurd......!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Don't tell me all of Britain is like this now...)
 

---

 
**Percival:**
I'm sorry...even though I need to be fighting...
 
**Artoria:**
That's enough of that! Here, eat this!
 
**Artoria:**
Dried fruits reserved for the occasion! You should be able to recover a bit of your strength!
 
**Percival:**
Thank you...very much for this. You really are the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Percival:**
An incredibly strong and straightforward girl... I'm glad I believed in and waited for you.
 
**Da Vinci:**
This road's messed up! There are Mors piling up everywhere!
 
**Da Vinci:**
We can't make any careless moves! What on earth is happening!?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Woah, you made it back. How are the other cities holding up?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I see. So it's finally begun...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Grimm?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Both Gloucester and Londinium are out of the question.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Mors are appearing all throughout the island. Every city has closed its gates and gone on the defensive.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
On top of that, fairies consumed by fear are likely to turn into Mors on their own.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
There is no safe haven left in Britain. The Great Calamity has begun.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why did this begin so suddenly!?|
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It was bound to happen. Morgan had been anticipating it for years.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
However...she couldn't have known what form the Calamity would take until the time came.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The Great Calamity is like rot that's gathered across Britain for over a thousand years.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The island is flooded with the magical energy of a large amounts of “voices of agonizing death”, which the Calamity accumulates to grow in size.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's how the Great Calamity is...as long as Britain exists here, it is bound to happen.
 
**Da Vinci:**
It sounds like a form of bloodletting...
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's like it's getting rid of the bad blood in its veins... or rather, the earth's...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Do you understand what kind of Calamity will come from that this time, Grimm?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I do...no, more like I know what it is.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I didn't get it when Morgan was around, but now that's she's gone I can guess what's going on.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The Great Pit. The guy secluded down there is on his way up.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
That's the reason I was sent here. But...there's more to it than that.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not all...?|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The red and black Calamities in the prophecy...?
 
**Artoria:**
...
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah. According to Freki and Geri's noses, there's signs of more than one Calamity.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Those two are out of my jurisdiction. I have no idea what form they will take.
 
**Mash:**
Please wait a second. Did you just say “signs?”
 
**Mash:**
Then the Calamity hasn't really begun yet, has it? The Great Pit...
 
**Mash:**
Tonelico said “if it wakes up, Britain is finished.”
 
**Mash:**
Whatever's at the bottom isn't fully awake yet, so...!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You want to strike while we still can? Sounds like a plan. You saved me a long explanation, lass.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
But we'll need the cooperation of the Fairy of Paradise. “What comes after the pilgrimage”&mdash;
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The God of Wisdom says we have to put what's at the bottom of the pit back to sleep.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Still, they're some pretty vague instructions. I don't know exactly what it's talking about.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
&mdash;Artoria, this is where you take over.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The final stop on the pilgrimage. The true purpose of the Fairies of Paradise.
 
？1,1070,saveMaterial：Artoria...?
？2,2070,saveMaterial：... (It's probably...)
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
That's...
 
**Artoria:**
It's&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Aah, what awful timing! Read the room or something, geez!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ignore, ignore! Just keep going, Artoria, I'll call them back later!
 
**Mash:**
Uh&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, wait a second!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We got a call! Da Vinci, that was from Chaldea!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
That's right, Da Vinci! That was the radio! The radio is working again!
 
**Mash:**
None of our electronics were working in Britain, but now they are!
 
**Da Vinci:**
...!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course! Of all the boneheaded...Hello? Hello!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Codename Watson here! Chaldea, come in!
 
**Holmes:**
This is 221B Baker Street. It seems our reception is good, Miss Watson.
 
**Holmes:**
We're not quite certain what is happening there. Our last carrier bird message was four days ago.
 
**Holmes:**
So I'll just sum up our situation for you.
 
**Holmes:**
The Border's internal systems have been gradually coming back online for the past hour.
 
**Holmes:**
The systems knocked offline just by approaching Britain have also been restored.
 
**Holmes:**
We're currently replenishing energy with steam power and performing maintenance on all sections.
 
**Holmes:**
Also, the radar has confirmed high levels of magical energy pollution throughout the island.
 
**Holmes:**
Britain is starting to fall apart. It may only be speculation, but I'm confident that's the truth.
 
**Holmes:**
The island itself was rejecting pan-human history, including the Storm Border.
 
**Holmes:**
If Britain loses its power, then we'll inevitably be able to intervene.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So the Border can move now!?|
 

---

 
**Holmes:**
Of course, {(M)Mr./(F)Miss} Fujimaru.
 
**Holmes:**
For that reason, I'd like you all to return to the Border immediately.
 
**Holmes:**
Professor is still not fully recovered.
 
**Holmes:**
Da Vinci's assistance will be necessary to put together a cruising program for Britain's magical energy density.
 
**Holmes:**
The Storm Border will return to full functionality about six hours after you return.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Hurry, Da Vinci!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! If it's coming from that Great Pit, then the Storm Border can...
 
**Mash:**
No, we can stand up against any Calamity! We can treat Percival too!
 
**Percival:**
No...I'm very grateful you thought of me, but...
 
**Percival:**
Please...if you would, just leave me behind.
 
**Percival:**
You're in a race against time now, aren't you...? You can't afford to let me burden you.
 
**Mash:**
That's not the case at all!
 
**Mash:**
I'll carry you on my back, so we should have no trouble moving!
 
**Mash:**
Isn't that right, Da Vinci!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
As long as we don't run across a swarm of Mors again. Though that doesn't seem very likely.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Percival...the Mors will come even if you stay here.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If we leave you behind, that means we'll be leaving you to die.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You know that and yet you'll still ask us to do so?
 
**Da Vinci:**
You called us all friends. Artoria, Mash, and Fujimaru.
 
**Percival:**
That's...
 
**Percival:**
Yes... I know it's terribly selfish of me.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see...If you're prepared to go that far, then there's nothing more for me to say.
 
**Mash:**
Da Vinci!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yep. Talking more would be pointless, so let's just force you to come with us!
 
**Da Vinci:**
All right, Red Rab-bit! I know you're hiding, come out here!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Oh, I've been found out? But I was champing at the bit for the best timing.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Red Rab-bit!? What are you doing here!?|
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Why indeed? There is a reason, but I cannot disclose it.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Please do not question or investigate this any further. That is the relationship between me and you.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't tell me...you were following us!?
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Well, yes...those were my orders. To follow and report on you.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
But I've stopped doing that. I've resigned from various positions, and right now I'm unemployed.
 

---

 
**Red Rabbit:**
Anyway, I've understood the situation while hiding behind a tree.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Everybody, do you require a carriage? It happens to be a special runaway express.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Driven by the foremost of the greatest horses in the Fairy Kingdom, capable of running all the way to the destination without rest.
 
**Barghest:**
Hah...hah...hah...that makes seventy, huh...
 
**Barghest:**
Pathetic...feeling tired from a fight of this magnitude...
 
**Barghest:**
Aah...my body feels hot...my horn feels like bursting...!
 
**Barghest:**
Aaaaaahhh!!!
 
**Barghest:**
Haah, haaah&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
Unnnngh....!
 
**Barghest:**
What's going on...the more I kill, the more there are... no...
 
**Barghest:**
I feel more and more tired...and I can't think straight...
 
**Barghest:**
They're still here...? There's no end to them. There's no end, but...
 
**Barghest:**
The Round Table Army is escaping outside...! Come, Mors! I will be your opponent!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Barghest:**
What's happening...I'm seeing red...did the Mors poison get into my eyes...?
 
**Barghest:**
I...can't see well...it's almost like it's nighttime, but...
 
**Barghest:**
Alright...that was the last one. They gave me a fair bit of trouble, but now the Round Table Army humans should...
 
**Round Table Army Soldier:**
...
 
**Barghest:**
Aaa...aaaaah...aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough...
 
**Barghest:**
Telling them to flee the castle...how conceited of me&mdash;!
 
**Barghest:**
But...was there any other way...?
 
**Barghest:**
If only death awaits both inside and outside, then...
 
**Barghest:**
Would it have been better&mdash;if I had just devoured them all?
 
**Barghest:**
The weak are sustenance for the strong. The strong should protect the weak.
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;That's right.
 
**Barghest:**
Even if this is...the end for Britain...there are yet things I want to protect...
 
**Barghest:**
I have to go...I'm sorry, but I cannot afford to fall here with you all.
 
**Barghest:**
Manchester...to Manchester...as the lord of that city, I have to...
 
**Barghest:**
I have to protect the denizens of Manchester&mdash;
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Spriggan:**
&mdash;Ooh, there are Mors all over the plains! Those same predatory types that showed their faces in Norwich!
 
**Spriggan:**
Hurry! I don't care if you ruin the wheels, we have to reach Norwich before sundown!
 
**Fairy Horse:**
B-but, Lord Spriggan! The soldiers we left outside Salisbury are&mdash;!
 
**Spriggan:**
Not another word about that! I brought up that army myself! It's deplorable!
 
**Spriggan:**
Even so, with this many Mors there is nothing that can be done! An armed human would make no difference!
 
**Spriggan:**
Only the Fang Clan could handle this many Mors!
 
**Spriggan:**
And unfortunately for us, they vanished after heading to Gloucester!
 
**Fairy Horse:**
Th-then, isn't it pointless to escape to Norwich!? If we join forces with the northern fairies once more&mdash;
 
**Spriggan:**
It's precisely because I cannot do that is why I'm resorting to this! The lot of them won't settle down now that Knocknarea is dead!
 
**Spriggan:**
I was planning on dealing with her eventually, but there's a time and a place for everything!
 
**Spriggan:**
Why kill her now!? Why not wait until after the Great Calamity!?
 
**Spriggan:**
The fairies absolutely need a ruler to rally under! Morgan's history is proof of that!
 
**Spriggan:**
What was that woman thinking&mdash; &mdash;thinking&mdash;
 
**Spriggan:**
No, could it be...she wasn't thinking at all?
 
**Spriggan:**
No thoughts of the future, no aspirations of power, no belief that she'd best ruler this kingdom&mdash;
 
**Spriggan:**
Nothing...at all?
 
**Spriggan:**
Is she nothing more than a woman who wishes to get rid of anything she dislikes!?
 
**Spriggan:**
&mdash;I don't believe this!
 
**Spriggan:**
You can't live for more than 2,000 years thinking like that! She's nothing but a monster!
 
**Fairies:**
Don't believe the northern fairies! Knocknarea was the Calamity!
 
**Fairies:**
Salisbury is Lady Aurora's city, and we'll protect it ourselves!
 
**Fairies:**
Is anybody affected by the Mors' poison!? Say something before it gets worse, we'll treat it right away!
 
**Fairies:**
The outside is dangerous! Protect the humans! They're our property! Don't let them leave the city!
 
**Fairies:**
Anyone who opens the gate is a traitor. Report as soon as you find one!
 
**Fairies:**
Conduct yourselves as befits your clan! Lady Aurora will see us through this somehow!
 
**Fairies:**
Hail, Lady Aurora! Hail, Lady Aurora! Hail, Lady Aurora! Hail, Lady Aurora!
 
**Aurora:**
The day breaks without a single issue. How nice.
 
**Aurora:**
How nice to see all the commotion outside has calmed down! Now, let's enjoy our morning tea, Coral.
 
**Coral:**
Lady Aurora...to call that peaceful...
 
**Coral:**
They are having difficulty disposing of the fairy corpses on the main road. The gates have been shut, so they cannot be carried outside...
 
**Coral:**
And what's more...the northern fairies...
 
**Aurora:**
Yes, what a sad ending for them...
 
**Aurora:**
Not only is Knocknarea dead, but the secret of Edinburgh is out...
 
**Aurora:**
What has happened to the northern fairies in Salisbury?
 
**Coral:**
They've all gradually lost their strength and collapsed, as if in response to Knocknarea's death...
 
**Coral:**
We've reopened the nursery and placed the ones still breathing under house arrest there.
 
**Aurora:**
A nursery? Is there such a place in Salisbury?
 
**Coral:**
The institute for raising human children you ordered built sixteen years ago, Lady Aurora.
 
**Coral:**
It has stood abandoned for six years, so I took it upon myself to make use of it.
 
**Aurora:**
Oh, that little house! I loved it! So adorably built.
 
**Aurora:**
But that...what was his name, the grey-haired human child.
 
**Aurora:**
It's been a little difficult to go there since that child was discarded...
 
**Coral:**
That was...someone we've already forgotten. Why did you discard him, Lady Aurora?
 
**Aurora:**
Hm? Well, he grew up from making use of the spear, didn't he?
 
**Aurora:**
He's only human. Once he looks like an adult, he can't be the Child of Prophecy anymore, can he?
 
**Coral:**
So that's what it was...
 
**Coral:**
Was it selfish of me to reopen the nursery?
 
**Aurora:**
No, it was a good idea, Coral. That place is well-equipped for purging the interior.
 
**Aurora:**
We can send them all off to sleep with but one finger. Just right for the wounded northern fairies.
 
**Aurora:**
Anyway, have the Child of Prophecy and her friends been captured yet?
 
**Aurora:**
To murder Knocknarea simply because they lost their competition...
 
**Aurora:**
I will not allow it. The Child of Prophecy must be punished accordingly.
 
**Aurora:**
The Foreign Magus is...equally guilty, but must have been tricked by the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Aurora:**
As the leader of the Wind Clan, I will offer clemency for {(M)his/(F)her} crimes.
 
**Aurora:**
{(M)He/(F)She} must have so many stories about the outside world to share!
 
**Aurora:**
Hehe, what fun this will be, Coral! What could the world outside Britain be like?
 
**Aurora:**
There must be so many different types of humans. After all, it's a world expanded through their own efforts.
 
**Aurora:**
It must be filled with so many strange, captivating things.
 
**Coral:**
&mdash;Now is not the time for that.
 
**Coral:**
The Mors continue to increase in number outside the city, and the fairies that have escaped from the surrounding forests are beating on the gate.
 
**Coral:**
Some fairies inside Salisbury are developing symptoms of of the Mors sickness.
 
**Coral:**
We urgently need more places to treat them.
 
**Coral:**
After opening the gates and admitting the refugees, we must open the cathedral for that purpose.
 
**Coral:**
We can't handle this on our own.
 
**Coral:**
We should ask the humans of Gloucester or Londinium for assistance&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
Why? Why not just keep the gates closed?
 
**Aurora:**
Have the guards pass judgement on any fairy who contracts the Mors sickness. That is why we raised the humans, after all.
 
**Coral:**
Lady Aurora...what are you saying?
 
**Coral:**
It's true that humans are lesser beings, but they too have hearts.
 
**Coral:**
Having them execute their fellow citizens is...
 
**Coral:**
And to abandon the refugees outside&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
They will be fine. They are strong children who chose a life in those shabby woods rather than in my city.
 
**Aurora:**
They will survive this time as well, somehow or another. We shall preserve the peace in Salisbury.
 
**Aurora:**
Everything will settle down in time, Coral. Let's just remain calm until then, alright?
 
**Coral:**
So we...do nothing? Just hide away in the safety of the bell tower?
 
**Aurora:**
You shouldn't say such naughty things, you know? Now I'll have to take away your wings.
 
**Aurora:**
Just like that argument-loving Harobalomia.
 
**Aurora:**
You know my feelings, and you work for me&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
What a smart girl. She always was, and always will be.
 
**Gloucester Fairy:**
That's it...we don't know the details, just what was relayed with the Voice of the Wind.
 
**Gloucester Fairy:**
The coronation ceremony at Salisbury was interrupted. Lady Knocknarea was murdered by the Child of Prophecy,
 
**Gloucester Fairy:**
and Mors are materializing all over Britain.
 
**Gloucester Fairy:**
The Mors' corruption is leaking out of the Great Pit, and Camelot has fallen under a dark fog...
 
**Muryan:**
I understand...it will definitely spread this far.
 
**Muryan:**
It seems the Great Calamity has begun. But Gloucester's position will not change.
 
**Muryan:**
Gloucester's way...
 
**Muryan:**
Accept any and all refugees, so long as they swear to contain their fun within clan lines.
 
**Muryan:**
My Fairy Territory is still going strong. The Mors will not come into Gloucester.
 
**Muryan:**
Still...there's nothing that can be done about the fairies turning into Mors inside.
 
**Muryan:**
Call on some Fang Clan mercenaries to execute them.
 
**Muryan:**
Wait, no. Have them immediately sent to the surrounding forests to clear them out.
 
**Muryan:**
The Fang Clan can withstand the Mors' poison better than any other. That's how they subdued the Mors King.
 
**Muryan:**
If this is nothing more than a large outbreak, then they should be able to handle it.
 
**Muryan:**
We'll have to deal with the Calamity that comes next... the fog coming out of the Great Pit.
 
**Muryan:**
Her Majesty Morgan may be no more, but the system she laid out is still solid.
 
**Muryan:**
The Fang Clan and Camelot's reserves...
 
**Muryan:**
If used appropriately, there will be no need to fear any Calamity.
 
**Gloucester Fairy:**
Uhm...Lady Muryan. The Fang Clan is no longer...
 
**Muryan:**
Hah? I've given you your instructions. Hurry up, get moving!
 
**Muryan:**
I must continue to study the Great Pit, and finally uncover the truth about it.
 
**Muryan:**
The story of Britain's origin, which Her Majesty decided to keep hidden away from the people...
 
**Muryan:**
The “first prophecy” and “Cernunnos.” If I can parse those out, I can uncover the true nature of the Great Calamity.
 
**Muryan:**
I don't know what exactly is trying to destroy our Britain...
 
**Muryan:**
But I swear on the Wing Clan, as the Lord of Gloucester I shall expose it magnificently!
 
**Gloucester Fairy:**
O-of course you will, my lady!
 
**Gloucester Fairy:**
You are Lady Muryan, wisest and most fair in all of Britain!
 
**Gloucester Fairy:**
I am so proud to be a citizen of Gloucester! Please, leave the city to us!
 
**Muryan:**
...
 
**Muryan:**
This isn't a situation where I can afford to relax. There's no time to lose.
 
**Muryan:**
If I don't have an answer before Koyanskaya gets back, I won't look good enough to be her friend.
 
**Muryan:**
I knew it...
 
**Muryan:**
Koyanskaya told me about the existence of “gods,” but...
 
**Muryan:**
In Britain, there was only one being who fit that description—Cernunnos—the beastial god of an island across the sea...
 
**Muryan:**
This must be the “God” at the bottom of the Great Pit.
 
**Muryan:**
The question is why did this “God” disappear, and what did the six clans wish for?
 
**Muryan:**
And&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
Why did this world follow a different path than pan-human history in the first place?
 
**Muryan:**
The answer...I'm so close...
 
**Muryan:**
...14,000 years ago...an invader fell from a shooting star...
 
**Muryan:**
...did this...the fairies...
 
**Muryan:**
H-how could that have happened!? But still&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
Retribution for&mdash;no, the sins of the forefathers are exclusively their own. It makes no sense to extend that grudge to their descendents!
 
**Muryan:**
Besides&mdash;if this is the truth, it's only natural the Great Pit would be there.
 
**Muryan:**
It's not “God” trying to destroy us, it's the island of Britain itself&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
&mdash;?
 
**???:**
Congratulations. You found your answer, Muryan.
 
**???:**
Well done on eradicating the Fang Clan. Thanks to you, the scale of this Calamity has increased dramatically.
 
**???:**
If they were still around, they could have defeated the Mors, and this wouldn't have developed into a Great Calamity.
 
**???:**
But this time, it'll be quite a show. The bigger the Calamity, the better. Thank you for your contribution in causing this apocalypse.
 
**???:**
You've had your revenge. And now you know the truth about Britain.
 
**???:**
Then you have no more regrets, right? It's that time, after all.
 
**Muryan:**
&mdash;aah&mdash;y-you&mdash;
 
**???:**
Oh, that's right. I have one final confession.
 
**???:**
It was so long ago, but I really am sorry for setting the Fang Clan after the Wing Clan.
 
**???:**
There wasn't really a reason for it, I was just in a bit of a bad mood at the time.
 
**Muryan:**
&mdash;
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Red Rabbit:**
We've been running towards the west coast for a day and a half now! We'll reach our destination soon!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
By the way, both my front and hind legs are going numb!
 
**Red Rabbit:**
If I may be so frank, I feel that any more of this would be dangerous! No, my racing life as a fairy horse will be at stake!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
To go that far...(sob)!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks for taking us this far, Red Rab-bit!
 

---

 
**Red Rabbit:**
Yes. My legs aside, we have about twenty seconds before the carriage wheels break.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
Are you ready to jump out and run to the ocean? I can see a large number of Mors on the beach.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
To the very end I wasn't sure about ban heman history,
 
**Red Rabbit:**
but perhaps you are the heroes who will truly save Britain.
 
**Red Rabbit:**
It was an honor to accompany you on that journey. And now&mdash;
 
**Red Rabbit:**
This is as far as I go. Everybody, please stay strong!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Thanks, Master Red Rab-bit! We couldn't have come this far without you!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Leave the rest to us. Let's kick their asses, Grimm! We'll clear a path to the coast!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're back!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(The bridge is unprecedentedly hectic!)

---

 
**Gordolf:**
Congratulations on a job well done! You did well coming back safe and sound, Fujimaru!
 
**Gordolf:**
So it would seem that this so-called 'Great Pit' is a threat! We're picking up abnormal magical signatures on our end!
 
**Gordolf:**
According to SHEBA, the collapse event is due to occur in a few hours!
 
**Gordolf:**
I would've liked to let you take a short break in your room, but can you give us a detailed rundown!?
 
**Gordolf:**
I'd lose my nerve otherwise! No, first we need to get a headcount!
 
**Gordolf:**
You're the King Arthur of the Fairy Kingdom, Artoria, that was in the report!
 
**Gordolf:**
You're Percival of the Round Table Army! And you're obviously Cu Chulainn!
 
**Gordolf:**
Then we have the apostle of the Alien God, Senji Muramasa the Alter Ego!
 
**Gordolf:**
Hmm, you're as reliable as I had imagined! This solidifies our chances, I'd say!
 
**Gordolf:**
Guten Tag. Pleased to make your acquaintance, fellows from Fairy Kingdom Britain.
 
**Gordolf:**
I am the Director of Chaldea and Honorary Commander of the Border, Gordolf Musik.
 
**Gordolf:**
The situation is what it is. I have no intention of putting labels like pan-human history or Lostbelt on any of us.
 
**Gordolf:**
I'd like you to lend us your strength, as comrades, in putting an end to this unprecedented panic.
 
**Gordolf:**
By the way...
 
**Gordolf:**
Aren't we missing a few here? You had more companions in your reports, right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gareth and Oberon are...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Habetrot is still in Salisbury...
 

---

 
**Gordolf:**
What are you saying!? What about the northern fairies then?
 
**Gordolf:**
Didn't you become Mab-friends with that Medb lookalike after a Mab-match with her!?
 
**Mash:**
Knocknarea...passed away at the coronation...
 
**Gordolf:**
Oh...I see. A death at a coronation...must have been a violent one. How unfortunate.
 
**Gordolf:**
We can't count on the departed, nor have we any need to blame them...
 
**Gordolf:**
Allow me to go over the situation again, ladies and gentlemen. Currently, this ship is preparing for a water takeoff sequence.
 
**Gordolf:**
Nevertheless, it will be some time before takeoff.
 
**Gordolf:**
Technical Advisor, hurry over to the computer room. Nemo Professor needs your help.
 
**Gordolf:**
Mash Kyrielight will give the Fairy Kingdom pair a warm welcome.
 
**Gordolf:**
Hmm, Percival doesn't look too good. Take him to the infirmary first.
 
**Gordolf:**
As for Muramasa and Grimm, now that you have boarded this ship, you will both be treated as Chaldean Servants.
 
**Gordolf:**
Have a chat with Captain Nemo regarding our upcoming battle formation.
 
**Gordolf:**
As for Fujimaru, you will&mdash;
 
**Gordolf:**
Huh...you look as pale as I, but I suppose you're used to it.
 
**Gordolf:**
First things first, get yourself checked for physical trauma in the infirmary, then replenish your Command Spells with our precious 'spare Command Spells'.
 
**Gordolf:**
Come back here afterwards so the Administrative Advisor and I can debrief you. I'll need you to explain each and every last aspect of Britain.
 
**Gordolf:**
After all, we'll be storming it in a couple of hours with the Storm Border.
 
**Gordolf:**
I'll need information on not just the land itself, but also your understanding of the fairies.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Yes, sir!|
 

---

 
**Gordolf:**
Very well! It's been a day and a half since our last remote communication. Assuming there's another six hours until takeoff, that'll approximately be two days.
 
**Gordolf:**
There's no possible way the world can end in just two days, we still have plenty of time left! We have to!
 
**Gordolf:**
Intense fighting is to be expected from this point forward. I want each and every last one of you to avoid panic, remain calm and recuperate!
 
**Narration:**
~Two hours since the emergency meeting began~
 
**Holmes:**
I see...I've got a good grasp on the situation at hand.
 
**Holmes:**
Thank you for the detailed report, {(M)Mister/(F)Miss} Fujimaru.
 
**Holmes:**
Now we know what must be done. Although, we must re-examine whether it is possible or not.
 
**Gordolf:**
Hmph. What exactly do you mean by 'what must be done'?
 
**Holmes:**
Broadly speaking, there are two things.
 
**Holmes:**
One is stopping the fall—the Collapse of Britain.
 
**Holmes:**
In other words: investigating the Great Pit, and preventing the Calamity. That is, eradicating the Mors that have appeared all over Britain.
 
**Holmes:**
Second is our objective as Chaldea. The acquisition of a Divine Construct.
 
**Holmes:**
This was just a hair's breadth away, although it unfortunately ended in failure.
 
**Gordolf:**
Hmm, the dismantling of Camelot's Holy Lance!
 
**Gordolf:**
I won't blame the Round Table Army, but couldn't they have finished it a day sooner!? Damn it!
 
**Holmes:**
While we're on that topic...Grimm the Wise, would you kindly step over here?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
What's the matter? You have a question for me?
 
**Holmes:**
Just a few, regarding the Divine Construct.
 
**Holmes:**
We had assumed our objective would be complete once we manage to seize the Holy Lance of Camelot, however...
 
**Holmes:**
According to {(M)Mister/(F)Miss} Fujimaru, you had a dispirited look on your face when that topic was brought up.
 
**Holmes:**
May I ask why?
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's great news. I'm not sure if a Holy Lance made by Morgan herself is something we can handle,
 
**Da Vinci:**
but it'll be great reference material for a Divine Construct. You've really saved us.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Woah, you sure do pick up on the details. Well, I guess so. That is a mistake.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
You can remove the Holy Lance all you want, but you can't arm this ship with it.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
A Divine Construct comes as a set with its wielder. Even if you make one, it's still unusable if you lack the qualifications.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's something that you Chaldeans&mdash;no, something that the bleached pan-human history lacks.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
As long as you lack that, Chaldea can never possess the Divine Construct.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Qualifications...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something we lost in the bleaching...?
 

---

 
**Holmes:**
&mdash;It can't be. No, if considered more coherently&mdash;
 
**Holmes:**
The reason we had to come to this Lostbelt, no matter what.
 
**Holmes:**
I see, so the reason Miss Sion was so insistent about Britain was because she knew about it...!
 
**A：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
Woah, warning, waaaarning!
 
**A：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
Gravitational fluctuations have been confirmed in the heart of Britain! Amazing, it's like the Alien God's pseudo-black hole.
 
**A：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
Something really bad's coming out (sob)! Ugh, I'd rather not use the scope to check it out!
 
**B：Nemo Marine (Observer, Right):**
What are you&mdash;oh no, we're in big trouble! Fires are breaking out all across Britaaiiin!
 
**B：Nemo Marine (Observer, Right):**
The source of the fire is northwestern Britain!
 
**B：Nemo Marine (Observer, Right):**
Fiery winds are sweeping across the entire island of Britain, like a tsunami, from the city of Manchester~!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gravitational fluctuations at the Great Pit!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fires in Manchester!?
 

---

 
**Nemo:**
No panicking, calm yourselves! Gather more detailed observational data.
 
**Nemo:**
I'd also like to have a visual. Aim the super telephoto lens we used in Atlantis at the heart of Britain.
 
**A：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
It's not showing up on the screens! It's pitch black, I'm telling you, pitch black!
 
**A：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
It's like I'm taking a peek at the darkest, abyssal depths! But something is occurring, no doubt about that!
 
**Nemo:**
Looks like we'll have to go there ourselves to confirm it...
 
**Nemo:**
What has Professor reported? How much longer until the cruising program is complete?
 
**B：Nemo Marine (Assistant Pilot):**
She said it's already complete! They're currently verifying it and they want 30 minutes to renew it.
 
**Nemo:**
As expected of the talented Da Vinci. Three hours ahead of schedule.
 
**Nemo:**
Gordolf, Holmes. The ship will now prepare for combat.
 
**Nemo:**
Fujimaru, go and fetch Mash and Artoria Caster.
 
**Nemo:**
We have no time to spare.
 
**Nemo:**
As captain, I'm reluctant to say this, but we likely won't have the time to perform a test run.
 
**Da Vinci:**
For the time being, I attempted treatment of minor injuries and tried using active ampoules, but...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Are you really sure you don't want to enter a recovery pod?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if we can't hope for a fundamental recovery, I think we could get a little of your strength back...
 
**Percival:**
Thank you for your concern. However, I'll have to decline until the Great Calamity has been purged.
 
**Percival:**
If I lie on that bed, I won't be conscious for a few days, will I?
 
**Percival:**
As the commander of the Round Table Army, I find that hard to accept.
 
**Percival:**
Even if I cannot contribute, I wish to see Britain's fate with my own eyes.
 
**Percival:**
Hey, besides...
 
**Percival:**
I wouldn't be able to face the Round Table Army if I sleep through it all.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Percival:**
...
 
**Percival:**
Speaking of which, there's something I'd like to tell Artoria as well.
 
**Percival:**
I would've preferred not to say it, but since I got ahead of myself at the cathedral and let it slip...
 
**Da Vinci:**
You're talking about being a 'substitute Child of Prophecy', aren't you...? Is that why you're in such a terrible condition?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Aurora was the fairy who took in a human child... you, when you were but a newborn.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Woodwose selected you at the nursery. And Lancelot taught you swordsmanship.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Their purpose was to rear a Child of Prophecy of their own...am I correct in assuming this?
 
**Percival:**
Yes. Ever since Ainsel's prophecy, many measures were taken throughout Britain to obstruct the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Percival:**
The queen's troops would round up newborn fairies, and in some villages they'd shelter the next generation in order to let them grow.
 
**Percival:**
Certain places would raise them in secret.
 
**Percival:**
That's what the Lord of Salisbury must have thought.
 
**Percival:**
If you can't know where they're going to show up, why not just prepare one for yourself?
 
**Artoria:**
And so they gathered human children...and raised them as warriors.
 
**Artoria:**
To be a substitute Child of Prophecy, should the Child of Prophecy not appear 16 years later.
 
**Percival:**
I suppose so...I suppose they must have been thinking along those lines.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So what happened after that...?
 
**Percival:**
Lord Woodwose found me the most talented out of all the candidates.
 
**Percival:**
Salisbury housed the weapon that the savior Tonelico, who saved Britain during the Fairy Calendar, once wielded...
 
**Percival:**
This spear—the Spear of Selection—which had been left behind.
 
**Percival:**
A seal had been placed on it by Tonelico, such as “only the sinless may wield it”.
 
**Percival:**
There wasn't a single fairy who could touch the Spear of Selection. Only humans.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So that's why they gathered up human children. Even if their vitality falls short, they would still be capable of wielding the Spear of Selection...
 
**Da Vinci:**
To do so would be the minimum prerequisite to being named the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Percival:**
Yes. And one day, after having spent ten years at the nursery, I was able to draw out the power of the Spear of Selection.
 
**Percival:**
I believe I was...chosen by the Spear of Selection. “Kill the wicked fairies with this spear”.
 
**Percival:**
I undoubtedly heard that voice in my head.
 
**Percival:**
And...that was also the day the Mirror Clan vanished from Britain.
 
**Percival:**
The day I was chosen by the Spear of Selection, she made her way to the Lake District, at her lord's behest.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Huh? Wait, hold on a minute.
 
**Artoria:**
The Mirror Clan vanished six years ago, right? But Percival, you're...
 
**Percival:**
The Spear of Selection expends the life of its wielder to exhibit its true power.
 
**Percival:**
I'm sorry, Artoria...I turn sixteen this year.
 
**Percival:**
I was roughly 10 years old when the Spear of Selection chose me, hence my appearance.
 
**Percival:**
I'd say my biological age places me around 26 years old.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The average life expectancy of a human in Britain is 30 years...So that's why you didn't undergo a second growth spurt.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Because there was nothing past that point from the start. Percival, the reason you're alive is&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
Yes. I believe it to be because I am sturdier and blessed with a longer lifespan compared to my fellow humans.
 
**Percival:**
Lord Woodwose had a keen eye, it seems.
 
**Percival:**
That is what I'd like to apologize for, Artoria.
 
**Percival:**
I was to act as a substitute Child of Prophecy... no, I was raised to undermine you.
 
**Percival:**
I hid that fact from everyone, and flew my banner in support of you.
 
**Percival:**
I used your name to establish the Round Table Army for my own sake.
 
**Percival:**
I preached peace for Britain even while my position itself was a falsehood. Where it was not my place to do so.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
That's not...that's not true...
 
**Artoria:**
It wasn't for your sake...because Percival, you're still...
 
**Artoria:**
(You're still forcing yourself to act, to save Mélusine, aren't you...?)
 
**Nemo:**
Attention, all Storm Border staff. The ship will now prepare for combat.
 
**Nemo:**
Intense gravitational fluctuations have been observed at the heart of Britain. Holmes believes this to be the onset of the Collapse event.
 
**Nemo:**
In 30 minutes, the ship will cease standby operation at sea, shift to flight configuration, and storm Britain.
 
**Nemo:**
Combatants are to assemble on the bridge. Combatants are to assemble on the bridge.
 
**Nemo:**
I repeat, the ship will&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Looks like that'll be all for now...I'm heading off to the computer room. What about the two of you?
 
**Percival:**
I'll head for the bridge. I have named myself a Knight of the Round Table, no matter how false it may ring.
 
**Percival:**
To witness Britain's fate is the least I can do to honor my fallen comrades.
 
**Percival:**
Though my wish was a futile one...
 
**Percival:**
Their wish of a future for both human and fae was genuine.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Gordolf:**
Th-th-this is impossible! How is this happening!? It's only been a day and a half!
 
**Gordolf:**
There's no way all of Britain could go up in flames in that time!
 
**Gordolf:**
Are the Mors really such terrible creatures!?
 
**Mash:**
No, the Mors don't burn things! This is an entirely different phenomenon!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's probably the “Red Calamity”...It seems like the fire started in Manchester...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
That's where you struck your deal with Barghest, right?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
The one where in a worst-case scenario, you'd load fairies onto this ship and take them into pan-human history.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I heard about that from Barghest!
 
**Mash:**
She said she already explained the situation to Manchester's citizens,
 
**Mash:**
and all the fairies happily agreed to it!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then we need to hurry...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can't we head to Manchester first!?
 

---

 
**Nemo:**
That was the plan. We have to confirm what started the fire.
 
**Nemo:**
It'll be a bit of a side trip, but it'll give us no problems on our way to storm into the Great Pit.
 
**Nemo:**
Da Vinci, how are things on your end?
 
**Da Vinci:**
No abnormalities with any of the Storm Border's functions! We're holding steady at 60 knots!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Manchester, right? I was thinking that should be our first stop too.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We promised Barghest after all! We're about ten minutes away, but&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's a huge fire surrounding the city at the moment!
 
**Da Vinci:**
The city's protected by walls, so the fairies inside should still be safe!
 
**Da Vinci:**
To take them into the Border, we'll need them to all act as a group.
 
**Da Vinci:**
So for that reason, I want Fujimaru and Mash to head into the city first!
 
**Da Vinci:**
As soon as we reach altitude, we're airdropping the Shadow Border.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The autopilot can handle the landing, but we need a driver. Meunière, can I ask you to take care of it?
 
**Meunière:**
S-sure thing! The old man's commanding, so I've got no choice!
 
**Nemo:**
A brave answer, Meunière. As expected of the Border's longest-serving pilot.
 
**Meunière:**
Ah! O-of course! I've just been putting my feet up until now, so I can at least do this much!
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm counting on you all. Gather all the fairies together and explain the situation to them.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Prepare to bring them onboard!
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
Whoa, we're like an airborne division! All thanks to Da Vinci's autopilot!
 
**Meunière:**
Surrounding hostiles&mdash;no Mors detected! Exterior temperature&mdash;1000 degrees Celsius!?
 
**Meunière:**
It's just like a wildfire out there! Fujimaru, keep your Mystic Code on!
 
**Meunière:**
Full throttle all the way to the streets of Manchester! Chaaaarge&mdash;!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We made it...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Open the hatch, we're heading out!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...!? Meunière, I can't disengage the hatch's lock!
 
**Mash:**
Open it quick&mdash;
 
**Meunière:**
You can't...you can't go out there now.
 
**Meunière:**
Shit...what the hell is going on!?
 
**Meunière:**
Wasn't Manchester supposed to be the perfect city!? So why&mdash;
 
**Meunière:**
How did it end up like this!?
 
**Mash:**
Meunière? What are you&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Look at the monitors...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Wh&mdash;is...this&mdash;
 
**Meunière:**
Corpses. Mountains of corpses! It's not just fairies, humans too!
 
**Meunière:**
And they didn't die in the fires.
 
**Meunière:**
There's human corpses with bite marks, and fairy corpses torn apart by stab wounds.
 
**Meunière:**
Meaning&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The humans were mauled to death...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The fairies were slain with weapons...
 

---

 
**Fleeing Fairy:**
Help! Help me! They're gonna kill Jenny too!
 
**Fleeing Fairy:**
Lord Barghest has lost her mind...!
 
**Fleeing Fairy:**
No, Jenny doesn't want to die, Jenny doesn't want to die...! They said we'd survive!
 
**Fleeing Fairy:**
They said that when the Great Calamity came, Chaldea would save us...!
 
**Fleeing Fairy:**
No, Jenny doesn't want to die yet! Jenny doesn't want to burn to death, Jenny doesn't want to be a knight anymore!
 
**Fleeing Fairy:**
Save me, save me, Oberon!
 
**Fleeing Fairy:**
Jenny didn't want to be born only to be killed!
 
**Barghest:**
Haah...aah...aaah...aa&mdash;aaah&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Bar...ghest...?
 
**Meunière:**
That's her...? She doesn't quite match the impression I got from the report...
 
**Meunière:**
Did she...do all this to Manchester...?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Open the hatch and exit!)|
 
**Meunière:**
Fujimaru, you idiot!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
... (It's dangerous. we can't go outside...)
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
The amount of magical energy is increasing...! What the, it's greater than the Storm Border's!?
 
**Meunière:**
She's devouring the smoke!? She's drawing magical energy out of the fairy corpses!
 
**Barghest:**
Aaah&mdash;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Barghest! What are you doing!?|
 
**Barghest:**
Aah...aah&mdash;Chal...dea...your...promise&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
No...get away...disappear...
 
**Barghest:**
You...already...the fairies...outside...
 
**Barghest:**
I'm sorry...for all my foolish deeds&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
Aah&mdash;AaaaaaAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!
 
**Mash:**
Master, get back in the Shadow Border...! It's not safe out there!
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
We'll be blown away like a ball! But we can't talk to her from inside the Border!
 
**Mash:**
Wah! Meunière, get us away from her! She's the magic eater from the report!
 
**Mash:**
She's sucking the life force out of Senpai!
 
**Meunière:**
I'm already on it! ...No, wait.
 
**Meunière:**
She's heading off somewhere. It's like she's ignoring us.
 
**Meunière:**
She's leaving the town...towards Gloucester? And it's not just her.
 
**Meunière:**
She's leading a lot of black dog-like things... like the Pied Piper of Hamelin...
 
**Meunière:**
She's started marching along with her black dogs...
 
**Mash:**
That's&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Black...Calamity?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Barghest...why...?
 

---

 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
The retrieval of the Shadow Border is complete. Should I set a course for the Great Pit?
 
**Holmes:**
Yes. Manchester has fallen utterly.
 
**Holmes:**
Barghest, with Black Dogs in tow...for the sake of convenience, let us refer to it as the “Beast Calamity”.
 
**Holmes:**
We could engage in combat with, and subsequently neutralize her, but heading to the Great Pit takes precedence.
 
**Holmes:**
No objections, I presume?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Hey, it is what it is, but you could've phrased it better.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
She may have been our enemy, but Barghest was one of the best the Fairy Kingdom had to offer&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
You're right...
 
**Artoria:**
I don't know why Barghest massacred the fairies at Manchester, but...
 
**Artoria:**
If she did all that, then it's no different than being a Mors. I have no objections towards labelling her as a Calamity.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well...that's fine and all, but don't be too hard on yourself, Artoria.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Nevertheless, a confrontation with Barghest is all but inevitable. She's the source of the flames sweeping across Britain.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Cities shielded by ramparts are holding out, but there's not a trace left of prairies and forests.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Black smoke is accumulating in the skies, birthing thunderclouds. She seems to be primarily feeding off the resultant lightning as sustenance.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The amount of magical energy in her is steadily rising as she strides across the ground.
 
**Da Vinci:**
At this rate, she'll end up an invincible monster. I'd have liked to neutralize her before that happens, but...
 
**Nemo:**
Confirming the situation at the Great Pit takes precedence. There's a red and a black Calamity, no?
 
**Nemo:**
Total war can wait until we assess the enemy's strength. Fortunately, the advance of the Beast Calamity is a slow one.
 
**Nemo:**
It appears to be headed in the direction of Oxford, but it will take four or five hours at this rate.
 
**Nemo:**
In the meantime, we can work out a countermeasure. Artoria, Fujimaru, am I clear?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
... (Nod)|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do we...really have to defeat her?
 
**Artoria:**
Yes...Barghest is gone for good.
 
**Artoria:**
I finally realized the purpose behind her gifted name.
 
**Artoria:**
It was to seal that which would have become a Calamity, by bestowing a different name upon it.
 
**Artoria:**
But because we...because I defeated Gawain...
 
**Mash:**
The curse of the Mors King...that was placed on the Black Dog, on the Fang Clan...
 
**Mash:**
Could it be that Barghest...
 
**Mash:**
Knew she would become a Calamity ever since she was born...
 
**Mash:**
And that's why...she was so strict with herself, striving to become the ideal knight...

**G：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
Hyaaah!? What is that, what is that, what is thaaaaat!?
 
**G：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
It's gross, it's gross! No, no, I don't want to look anymore!
 
**Nemo:**
Oh, shut it, lookout! What on earth is&mdash;
 
**Nemo:**
I see, you saw the Great Pit, didn't you? You can cry about it later, project it on the frontal monitor!
 
**Nemo:**
Regardless of whether we can make use of it or not, our main objective is the Holy Lance at Camelot!
 
**Nemo:**
We need to confirm the situation at the Great Pit as quickly as possible!
 
**G：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
Ugh, I don't like this, but roger that. Projecting the video feed!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wha&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What on earth is that?
 

---

 
**Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
The dark mist oozing out of the Great Pit is an intensely contaminative curse layer!
 
**Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
Anything it touches will lose its sense of self entirely and rot away, so be sure to avoid contact!
 
**Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
Yes, but this is amazing. The interior of the Great Pit is like an entirely separate dimension!
 
**Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
I'm not getting any readings no matter what I fire off! That's a bottomless pit of curses right there!
 
**Nemo:**
&mdash;No, we can worry about the Great Pit later. Our concern is this!
 
**Nemo:**
What are you doing, metrologist!? Do your job!
 
**Nemo Marine (Measuring Officer):**
That's a tall order&mdash;!
 
**Nemo Marine (Measuring Officer):**
Magical energy measurement, impossible! Saint Graph designation, unknown!
 
**Nemo Marine (Measuring Officer):**
Unable to put either total height or volume into exact numbers!
 
**Nemo Marine (Measuring Officer):**
Just above the Great Pit, it sports a height of over 2 kilometers!
 
**Nemo Marine (Measuring Officer):**
It's way too big! A creature like this doesn't exist, not even in the deep sea!
 
**Gordolf:**
&mdash;
 
**Holmes:**
Grimm the Wise, is this the god that was identified during Britain's creation period?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah. To the Celts, he was the King of the Beasts and Knower of the Underworld. In this Britain, he was the dawn of creation.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
&mdash;Beast God Cernunnos. The reason I was chosen as the vessel of the God of Wisdom.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
However&mdash;
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I had no idea he 'changed' this much. You've got to be kidding me, O God of Wisdom.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
This is beyond the scope of what either human or fairy could handle, you know?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;This figure&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was on the mural
 

---

 
**Gordolf:**
A-A-a-a-a-a-are we dreaming this!?
 
**Gordolf:**
Zeus was a machine, so that was still fine! There was the thing with the Lightning Tsar, but with snow mountains and a mammoth, it's still all well and good.
 
**Gordolf:**
But that thing is alive!
 
**Gordolf:**
A creature of that scale couldn't possibly exist! On top of that, it's looming right there in front of Camelot!
 
**Gordolf:**
This makes it impossible for us to retrieve Rhongomyniad! Or can we!?
 
**Gordolf:**
What do you reckon, Administrative Advisor!? Do we have a shot at it!?
 
**Holmes:**
I say this with great reluctance, but...
 
**Holmes:**
I haven't the faintest clue, Mister Gordolf. There are far too many unknowns regarding that life form.
 
**Holmes:**
However...just looking at it through the monitor is enough to tighten my chest and leave me breathless.
 
**Holmes:**
A fearsome 'curse' indeed.
 
**Holmes:**
Surely there can be no mightier God of Curses.
 
**Holmes:**
It would be suicidal to disembark at Camelot right now. But...in all likelihood...
 
**Holmes:**
Queen Morgan prepared the Holy Lances for this instance. That much is clear judging by their placement.
 
**Mash:**
Then...Tonelico...no, Queen Morgan...
 
**Percival:**
She was preparing a means of defeating that thing.
 
**Percival:**
&mdash;She must have had a plan in place to protect Britain.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then we should head for Camelot right away...!|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah. That big fella is still as a statue.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's possible that the creature is stationary, and a Servant can withstand the curses to an extent.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Like Fujimaru said, we ought to drop in on the throne at Camelot.
 
**Artoria:**
It's pointless...it's too late...it's all too late.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A dark mist is rising from the Great Pit...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That shape...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
It showed up in Norwich...! Then that means the Calamity back then was this creature's&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
That's right...that was just its 'hand'. Nothing more than one of its many hands.
 
**Gordolf:**
This is no time for that kind of talk! That hand, the blotches on that hand...! They're scaling the wall up towards Camelot...!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The castle&mdash;is being destroyed&mdash;|
 

---

 
**Nemo Marine (Measuring Officer):**
Magical energy count is skyrocketing! The contaminative curse layer from the Great Pit is rapidly expanding!
 
**Nemo Marine (Measuring Officer):**
The estimated amount of contaminant emission is 640 million tons! And it's still rising!
 
**Nemo Marine (Measuring Officer):**
&mdash;It's a tsunami of curses that's going to drown all of Britain!
 
**Nemo:**
Sharp turn, 180 degrees! Exit this airspace with engines at maximum output!
 
**Nemo:**
Even the Border won't hold up if we are consumed! Assume even the slightest scratch will do us in!
 
**Meunière:**
Guh, it's no use, the output isn't rising! We can't get to a higher altitude!
 
**Meunière:**
Cernunnos' hands...one hundred, two hundred. Woah, they're nigh uncountable, we can't shake them off!
 
**Meunière:**
There are hands in every direction! There's no dodging this!
 
**Nemo:**
&mdash;! Da Vinci, how's the Shadow Border!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's useless, even if we load everyone on the Shadow and escape, the surface is a sea of curses.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There isn't a single escape route anywhere! This is&mdash;already&mdash;
 
**Nemo Marine (Observer):**
Ahhhh, contact in 7, 6, 5&mdash;! Bye-bye, everyone!
 
**G：Nemo Marine (Observer):**
&mdash;Visibility, clear! Somehow that disgusting thing is gone!
 
**Meunière:**
We have our output back! We can do this, we can escape from this sector!
 
**???:**
Splendid. That makes it worth my effort putting myself on the line.
 
**???:**
Did that teach you a thing or two about the secureness of NFF Services?
 
**Gordolf:**
Wha&mdash;this icily sweet, Vitchily beautiful voice is&mdash;!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Tamamovitch Koyanskaya!?|
 

---

 
**Koyanskaya:**
Lady Muryan? You left the lights off again, good grief.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I have just returned from the coronation. I believe you already know the situation at hand&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
This is...a bloodstain...
 
**Muryan:**
&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Muryan!?
 
**Muryan:**
Oh...Koyan...skaya...welcome...back...
 
**Muryan:**
Thank goodness. I still haven't said my farewell.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
That's a relief. Because I too came to say goodbye.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I truly am grateful for the flexibility of financing and commerce in Gloucester.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Although the only things I stocked up on in Fairy Britain were Mors,
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I was able to enjoy a relaxing vacation thanks to your generosity, Lady Muryan. I will return this favor someday, I swear it.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
When I establish my very own Primatosphere, I will be sure to extend an invitation.
 
**Muryan:**
Hehe...that does sound very exciting.
 
**Muryan:**
But...I'm sorry. I...can...no...longer...tell.
 
**Muryan:**
Because, even now...it's like I'm having a dream. Once I wake up, I'm sure...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
That you'll forget...?
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Please rest assured, for I am the Beast of Treasuring. Unlike humans, I never forget a debt owed.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
You peculiar princess, who called me a friend.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I hereby purchase your joys and sorrows as a valued product.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Moreover, as it is a favorite of mine, I shan't be putting it up for sale.
 
**Muryan:**
I see...then...I suppose I'll have you pay for it.
 
**Muryan:**
I was a fool...I couldn't hold back my hatred, or my wretchedness.
 
**Muryan:**
And this was the result...I never realized who the real enemy was...
 
**Muryan:**
I was manipulated to the bitter end. That's why, at the very least&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
You wish to retaliate? Please, leave it to me. I shall follow this trail of blood and make sure to visit vengeance&ndash;
 
**Muryan:**
&mdash;at the very least, keep Britain safe.
 
**Muryan:**
We were creatures fated to perish. Oh, so very sinful&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
But, please protect Britain and this Fairy Kingdom, in spite of that.
 
**Muryan:**
Not perishing as a matter of course against the Great Calamity.
 
**Muryan:**
But rather...seeing this year as our final destination... and perishing as we make that our goal&mdash;
 
**Muryan:**
Would you be willing...to humor me, Koyanskaya?
 
**Muryan:**
For you, oh-so-lonely without a kindred spirit, all alone in this world, just like me&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
To 'protect Britain in the truest sense of the word'&mdash;the order you placed has been received.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
If it is not to defeat, but to protect, then it is clear what I must protect.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Please, leave it to the powerful, state-of-the-art, united front of NFF Services.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Oh yes, I will protect it indeed, quickly and swiftly as the biggest obstruction to the mastermind!
 
**Holmes:**
Ah! That's Koyanskaya's Beast form! Marine, can you get us a visual!?
 
**G：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
I can't, our visuals are being jammed! No response on the sonar either!
 
**G：Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
Hold on, wooooooah!!!!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Would you kindly refrain from firing off those waves like you're off whaling? It's getting in the way of my focus.
 
**Holmes:**
Hm, sonic wave interference.
 
**Holmes:**
(A confrontation with Koyanskaya is all but inevitable, just like with Limbo...)
 
**Holmes:**
(I was hoping for some inspiration for my deductions along with collecting data to subdue her...)
 
**Koyanskaya:**
On a separate note, do hurry up if you intend to retreat. This emergency evasion is a one-time bonus.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I will have to charge an appropriate fee for a second deployment ♡
 
**Gordolf:**
Right, commence full speed retreat! It's bound to be an absurd sum of money!
 
**Gordolf:**
But we'll still be paying the price for that first time sooner or later! Truly it was one head in nine tails. No, it was more like one survival in nine deaths!
 
**Gordolf:**
By the way, are you aware that I based this dandy joke of mine just now,
 
**Gordolf:**
on the fact that we had already triumphed against Koyanskaya at Olympus?
 
**Meunière:**
This is bad, we're losing engine output for some reason! Shut up, you old man, don't turn Koyanskaya off!
 
**Nemo:**
No, the pressure from the surface is returning... it would appear even Koyanskaya cannot ward it off more than once!
 
**Nemo:**
Meunière, I don't care if we lose a Triton! Floor it!
 
**Meunière:**
Aye aye, sir! My apologies, Engine!
 
**Koyanskaya:**
&mdash;This is as far as the friendship fee goes.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I shall be withdrawing to my headquarters, so I leave the rest up to everyone at Chaldea...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
It's easy to misconstrue the curse of Cernunnos as a world-ending weapon...
 
**Koyanskaya:**
Gah...but this curse is not one directed at foreign enemies. It's a curse of self-destruction, placed on oneself...and one's brethren.
 
**Koyanskaya:**
I had no choice but to absorb it in order to protect the ship, but this is&mdash;
 
**Koyanskaya:**
This is shaping up to be quite the poor investment...
 
**Narration:**
The ship made a narrow escape from the heart of Britain.
 
**Narration:**
Barghest, the Beast Calamity, who transformed into a titanic 'thing', laid waste to cities in her wake.
 
**Narration:**
Curses continued to overflow from Cernunnos as it crawled out of the Great Pit.
 
**Narration:**
The fairy villages scattered about burned as the earth cracked and collapsed, having reached its limit.
 
**Narration:**
Two hours had passed since the Storm Border took off, determined to 'save Britain'.
 
**Narration:**
Yet there was nothing left to be saved.
 
**Narration:**
The residents of Norwich were fighting over two ships, and had begun killing each others, divided between humans and fairies.
 
**Narration:**
In a barbershop, a human boy comforted a frightened fairy girl.
 
**Narration:**
Residents who had moved to Oxford in the hopes of becoming new nobility,
 
**Narration:**
were annihilated without the means to defend themselves from the Mors. Without the Fang Clan, they were helpless.
 
**Narration:**
Salisbury, despite having shut its gates in an act of self-defense, met an end far ghastlier than any other city.
 
**Narration:**
Londinium silently burned to ashes.
 
**Narration:**
The few survivors of the Round Table Army welcomed the fleeing fairies and repelled the Mors.
 
**Narration:**
In truth, the soldiers of the Round Table consisted mostly of the wounded,
 
**Narration:**
and the huddled fairies steeled themselves and protected them to the bitter end.
 
**Narration:**
In contrast, the denizens of Gloucester painlessly disappeared one after another.
 
**Narration:**
A girl who, a while back, was liberated from the western ranch, made her way back to Gloucester after much hardship.
 
**Narration:**
To save the downtrodden fairy&mdash;her master, who had needed her.
 
**Narration:**
Stepping into the burning city, reuniting, hand in hand, they disappeared into the cracks of the earth.
 
**Mash:**
So beautiful...this Britain that was so beautiful is...
 
**Holmes:**
That's right, Miss Kyrielight...
 
**Holmes:**
A Lostbelt cut off from its Fantasy Tree will disappear unnoticed as though it were just another day.
 
**Holmes:**
But this is different. This is a total apocalypse.
 
**Holmes:**
Even if a reason for such an end existed in this Fairy Kingdom&mdash;
 
**Holmes:**
If an individual responsible for this conclusion were to exist, I would not be able to accept them.
 
**Gordolf:**
H-hm. I can understand both Kyrielight's sorrow and Holmes's anger.
 
**Gordolf:**
I do understand, but what do we do now?
 
**Gordolf:**
If that dark mist overflowing from the Great Pit is to propagate across the earth,
 
**Gordolf:**
shouldn't we be preventing it at all costs!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's no longer possible...Even the Storm Border can no longer approach it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Our trump card, the 12 Rhongomyniads, were destroyed along with Camelot.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's no stopping the Collapse predicted by TRISMEGISTUS II now...
 
**Holmes:**
That is correct...Britain's destruction is certain.
 
**Holmes:**
And this destruction will propagate across the earth, engulfing Lostbelts and pan-human history alike in darkness.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**???:**
Come now, there's still hope. You're an hour too early to be giving up.
 
**???:**
The sinful deeds of the fairies accumulated over 14,000 years.
 
**???:**
The two Calamities mentioned in the prophecy. The carcass of the god that appeared in the Great Pit.
 
**???:**
The power of pan-human history cannot overcome them. They are not something you can defeat.
 
**???:**
But these are all fantasies with 'this situation' as their precondition.
 
**???:**
The British Lostbelt grew into a Singularity and reached a standing like that of pan-human history.
 
**???:**
A distortion of history, so to speak.
 
**???:**
If you correct the Singularity, history will be restored and the Fairy Kingdom will never have existed.
 
**???:**
Truly, this is your area of expertise. After all, you have conducted many such corrections, have you not?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This voice&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I heard it in a dream before leaving for Britain
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes! This voice is unmistakably&mdash;!
 
**Merlin:**
Hello there. I'm sorry I kept you waiting, everyone. The Magus of Flowers, Merlin, has finally taken the stage.
 
**Merlin:**
It's not like you all to give up. Your fight against Britain is just beginning.
 
## Section 27: Time of Creation 
 
**Merlin:**
Now, let me greet you once more. Hello, members of Chaldea.
 
**Merlin:**
With Morgan's defeat, the “Garden” is no more. I've been free for quite a while now.
 
**Merlin:**
Hope you don't mind me being so late. I was a little occupied with other preparations.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Merlin!|
 
**Merlin:**
The one and only. You seem to be doing well, Fujimaru.
 
**Merlin:**
But hey, what's with that tone just now? You seem glad I'm okay, but it sounds more like you're angry with me for watching from the sidelines.
 
**Merlin:**
That's a bit harsh coming from a level-headed {(M)chap/(F)lass} like you, don't you think?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fou Fooou!
 
**Merlin:**
That was Cath Palug's voice! No fair sticking with Chaldea!
 
**Mash:**
Sorry, Merlin...that was Senpai imitating Fou...
 
**Merlin:**
Is that what's popular in Chaldea now!? You should stop playing such games immediately!
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Ah, right. Excuse me, I'm still wavering, not entirely unlike a waking dream.
 
**Merlin:**
The me you're seeing right now is an illusion. I'm not really with you.
 
**Merlin:**
The only thing that comes back to me are your voices.
 
**Merlin:**
I can't see Fujimaru or Miss Mash.
 
**Merlin:**
So let's put off our joyous reunion for a little bit.
 
**Merlin:**
Hey, in a few hours I'll be able to see how far you all have grown.
 
**Merlin:**
I'll be sure to get myself all gussied up for when you find me at the entrance to Avalon.
 
**Artoria:**
Merlin...? You're Merlin the magician...?
 
**Merlin:**
Oh, is that the voice of the Child of Prophecy? Sorry to surprise you.
 
**Merlin:**
I have a lot to tell you, but now's not a good time. We'll talk privately later.
 
**Merlin:**
Your new commander is Gordolf, isn't it? Is he here?
 
**Gordolf:**
Y-yes. I am Gordolf Musik. You...you're Merlin the magician, correct?
 
**Gordolf:**
I won't ask why you just showed up out of nowhere. This definitely isn't the time.
 
**Gordolf:**
The only thing that matters is what you just said! What did you mean by “there's still hope”!?
 
**Merlin:**
What a nice, powerful voice. It makes you seem like the complete opposite of the previous acting director.
 
**Merlin:**
Hope is the means, the possibility of preventing the currently occurring Collapse.
 
**Merlin:**
To put it bluntly, I want the Fairy of Paradise back here right now.
 
**Merlin:**
You've been hearing the call of Avalon ever since you rang the bells, right?
 
**Merlin:**
The time has finally come for the Fairy of Paradise to carry out her mission.
 
**Merlin:**
Once that happens, you'll be able to defeat Cernunnos and eliminate this Singularity.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Does Paradise hold the way out of this situation...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
But...I'm not qualified enough for that...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Whether you are or not doesn't matter.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
If the Fairy of Paradise returns after ringing the Pilgrim's Bells, Cernunnos' curse will be weakened.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It won't vanish entirely, but it won't get any stronger either.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
This is coming from the God of Wisdom who dumped his power on me. The mythology is different, but there's no mistaking it.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Isn't that right, Ambrosius? My job is to get Artoria to you.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
“Just so long as she rings the Pilgrim's Bells. It doesn't matter if she's dead.”
 
**Artoria:**
Ah...I knew it...I knew that's how this would go...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Grimm! What the hell is wrong with you!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And Artoria! Why aren't you upset!?

---

 
**Artoria:**
I knew about it already...From the start, I could see what Grimm was planning to do.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...
 
**Merlin:**
That was only the worst-case scenario, Grimm the Wise. It doesn't apply now.
 
**Merlin:**
She's in the best possible state right now. That's how it feels to me.
 
**Merlin:**
The Avalon le Fae will fulfill her mission of her own free will.
 
**Merlin:**
“This is ridiculous, let's stop here.” “We've done enough, let's give up and all just get along!”
 
**Merlin:**
Even should others try to convince you, stay the course.
 
**Merlin:**
No matter what, you all must come to Avalon.
 
**Merlin:**
Albion, the dragon of boundaries, sank in the Dark Swamp. From that corpse, you can enter the Spirit Cave that leads to the Inner Sea of the Planet.
 
**Merlin:**
Now that Britain is dying, the road has opened up. It's only an hour's worth of spelunking.
 
**Merlin:**
Be that as it may, it's the world of magecraft's most sacred ground. Not just anyone can come in.
 
**Merlin:**
Fujimaru, as humanity's representative. Mash, as a member of the Knights of the Round Table.
 
**Merlin:**
Our Fairy of Paradise, and...well, I guess Muramasa can come as her servant.
 
**Merlin:**
The Spirit Cave will open the way for those four alone. Everyone else will just have to sit tight and wait.
 
**Holmes:**
So it seems. What do you think, Director Gordolf?
 
**Gordolf:**
Well, what choice do we have!? Captain, set course for the Dark Swamp!
 
**Gordolf:**
I'm sure it was in the Lake District! Technical advisor, do you have the coordinates!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Locked in and ready to go!
 
**Da Vinci:**
But the Spirit Cave? Merlin's only letting those four people in.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm not sure about such a small group...More importantly, I've always wanted to see the Inner Sea of the Planet!
 
**Da Vinci:**
I guess we'll have to trust them and just see them off! Are you ready, Fujimaru?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, but...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Artoria, are you okay with this...?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Mmmm...well, I guess so! If not, I'd just end up arguing with Grimm.
 
**Artoria:**
And if you think about it, isn't this like my first trip back home? I'm kinda looking forward to it now!
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Holmes:**
Very well. Then let us amend our strategy according to Merlin's directives.
 
**Holmes:**
Fujimaru, Mash, Artoria, Senji Muramasa.
 
**Holmes:**
These four will go through the passage labelled the “Spirit Cave” and head for the Inner Sea of the Planet&mdash;to Avalon.
 
**Holmes:**
The Storm Border will hold position over the Lake District. Captain and Da Vinci will stay focused on controlling it.
 
**Holmes:**
If we are attacked in any way, Grimm and I will intercept.
 
**Percival:**
Please wait...
 
**Percival:**
I may not understand any of this, and I don't know how much help I will be,
 
**Percival:**
but I too am a son of Britain. If there is an emergency, I will take the field as well.
 
**Artoria:**
Ah&mdash;no way, you need to rest, Percival!
 
**Artoria:**
You're still not fit to fight, are you!?
 
**Artoria:**
This is my decision as Child of Prophecy!
 
**Artoria:**
Percival must be well cared for and get lots of rest!
 
**Artoria:**
Okay!? Ab-so-lute-ly must! If that doesn't happen, I'll dump my whole mission here and now!
 
**Percival:**
All right then...if that is what the Child of Prophecy orders. Still...
 
**Percival:**
I never thought the time would come when you would seriously scold me.
 
**Percival:**
You were always so concerned about keeping the peace around you that you stifled your own feelings.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know, right?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're good at playing the honor student, Artoria.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Y-you think so? I'm always upfront about my feelings and don't hide anything...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, you're like that when you're acting aggressively stupid. The rest of the time though, you just hide it by acting all meek.
 
**Artoria:**
I don't act meek, and I don't hide anything! Who are you calling meek, Muramasa!?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Nemo:**
As we said earlier, the Storm Border will hold position over the Lake District.
 
**Nemo:**
The operation is expected to last for three hours. Any longer than that and the ship&mdash;no, all of Britain will be gone.
 
**Nemo:**
We can't predict what will happen inside the Spirit Cave.
 
**Nemo:**
Stay cautious, Fujimaru, but use your best judgement.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger. Breaking into the Spirit Cave Albion!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
This is...it feels different from how the Water Mirror did when I got sent away in Norwich.
 
**Mash:**
Is this the Spirit Cave Albion? Communications are&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Just like Da Vinci expected...all communications with Chaldea are cut off.
 
**Mash:**
Now identifying our current coordinates.
 
**Mash:**
10...20...40...80...80!?
 
**Mash:**
Master. It may sound unbelievable, but we're currently 80 kilometers below the surface...!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's far deeper than Britain's Great Pit. Actually, could this even be considered underground?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Not only is it pitch dark, but I can't even feel my footing.
 
**Merlin:**
Ah, you can tell. This is a world of different layers. Put simply, it's like a different dimension.
 
**Merlin:**
There's just a path down here from the surface thanks to Albion's influence.
 
**Merlin:**
From here you go even further down.
 
**Merlin:**
In pan-human history, Albion died at the 80 kilometer mark.
 
**Merlin:**
However, in this Lostbelt it managed to open a path to Avalon.
 
**Merlin:**
But that was too narrow for it to get through, so it had to die above ground.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is there a Spirit Cave in pan-human history?|
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
There is. Over there it's called the Spirit Tomb though.
 
**Merlin:**
The Spirit Tomb Albion of pan-human history is a dead end at this depth.
 
**Merlin:**
Beyond that is the realm of fairies, a land that humans cannot enter.
 
**Merlin:**
On the other hand, this one isn't bound by that limitation. This Lostbelt itself is a fairy realm.
 
**Merlin:**
As such, you can go all the way.
 
**Merlin:**
Put realistically, past the 400 kilometer depth all the way to the D-Layer 2,700 kilometers down...
 
**Merlin:**
That's your destination—the Inner Sea of the Planet.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
We're only 80 kilometers in, and our destination is at 2,700? Isn't that asking a bit much?
 
**Merlin:**
Not if you make use of shortcuts.
 
**Merlin:**
When I said one hour, I wasn't talking about distance. I meant the time it takes.
 
**Merlin:**
You can consecutively shorten the travel time to bring you closer to your goal.
 
**Merlin:**
Then again, this is all a bit boring. Let's turn on some lights.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It suddenly became a cave!|
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
What do you think? This fits the name of the place a bit better, don't you think?
 
**Merlin:**
Now, just keep going forwards. Each step you take will reduce the travel time.
 
**Merlin:**
This is Earth's memory...no, it's more like an infosphere.
 
**Merlin:**
You can get to your destination faster by skipping past vague information.
 
**Mash:**
T-that would be a big help...but...
 
**Artoria:**
Is that...Merlin? (for the third time)
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Is this the first time you've seen him?
 
**Merlin:**
Hm? Is there something wrong? Aah, you're just so taken with how dependable I am, right?
 
**Merlin:**
Oh yes, keep thanking me! You may start doing it too, Muramasa!
 
**Merlin:**
You know it's my first appearance here in awhile, so I want to make a strong impression with the time I have!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(No matter what I see, I'll just say nothing.)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This seems suspicious, so I won't say anything.)
 

---

 
**Mash:**
(You're right...it feels like we shouldn't get too deeply involved in this.)
 
**Mash:**
I'm more concerned about that though... Senpai, look at the wall...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. That's the mural that was in Londinium.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think that's...the Insect of the Abyss...
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Oh? Is that a reflection of the priestess' memory?
 
**Merlin:**
This is a good opportunity. In the hour it'll take to reach the Inner Sea I'll tell you how it all began.
 
**Merlin:**
The genesis story of Britain's Lostbelt, the Paradise Fairies' mission, and what that entailed.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Narration:**
At the end was the sea. At the beginning was the sea.
 
**Narration:**
As the falling star passed, all the earth became a stream...
 
**Narration:**
That is a story from long, long ago.
 
**Narration:**
When the six fairies went outside, they found that the whole world had turned into an ocean.
 
**Narration:**
“I'm sorry you had to face this, and I'm sorry things are this way.”
 
**Narration:**
A tremendous shadow arose from the ocean.
 
**Narration:**
It was a huge body covered in fluffy, bushy hair.
 
**Narration:**
On its shoulder sat an animal that should have no longer existed.
 
**Narration:**
The six fairies made friends with the god.
 
**Narration:**
The empty sea was boring, and difficult to live in,
 
**Narration:**
but the god held back the waves so that the six fairies could live in comfort.
 
**Narration:**
“The ocean without waves is nice, but we really miss the land!”
 
**Narration:**
The six fairies gave their joy to the god.
 
**Narration:**
The six fairies gave their pleas to the god.
 
**Narration:**
The six fairies offered to the god.
 
**Narration:**
Their wish was granted.
 
**Narration:**
The festival came to an end.
 
**Narration:**
Tricked into drinking poisoned wine, the god passed away.
 
**Narration:**
The six fairies obtained the god's corpse.
 
**Narration:**
It became new lands where there previously was none.
 
**Narration:**
They even cared for the animal that screamed as it was dragged away.
 
**Narration:**
Because there was only one human. Because only one human wasn't enough.
 
**Narration:**
Chopped, diced, scattered in a way that it wouldn't die.
 
**Narration:**
They used magic to make sure it wouldn't die no matter what they did to it.
 
**Narration:**
That was how Britain came to be. That is how this mistake originated.
 
**Narration:**
Salvation upon the original six. Curses upon the original six.
 
**Merlin:**
You might have heard it somewhere before, but that's the folk tale of how Britain was created.
 
**Merlin:**
Do you have any questions?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The details are different...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is that how it happened...?
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Yes. The first six fairies...the ancestors of the six clans, murdered Cernunnos.
 
**Merlin:**
The Great Pit in the land above is his grave, and the curse spilling out of it now is his wrath.
 
**Mash:**
Why would they...? Why would the fairies ever&mdash;
 
**Merlin:**
Well, they killed it because it became a bother.
 
**Merlin:**
When the six fairies left Paradise 14,000 years ago,
 
**Merlin:**
the Earth had already become an Ocean of Emptiness.
 
**Merlin:**
They were saved by a Celtic beast god that had also come to Earth...
 
**Merlin:**
The god that would later be known as Cernunnos.
 
**Merlin:**
He, along with the beast god's priestess, the last remaining human,
 
**Merlin:**
jointly protected the fairies. At first, they were grateful for it.
 
**Merlin:**
But no matter how much time passed, the Ocean of Emptiness remained unchanged. The land wouldn't appear.
 
**Merlin:**
The fairies eventually came under the impression that Cernunnos wasn't strong enough.
 
**Merlin:**
Besides, the priestess was constantly telling them to “live by the rules” and “reflect on their deeds.”
 
**Merlin:**
They really didn't like that about her.
 
**Merlin:**
Unable to take it anymore, the fairies decided to kill Cernunnos.
 
**Merlin:**
If there was no land, then a replacement would be fine.
 
**Merlin:**
The fairies though that if they could float Cernunnos' huge corpse, it would be about the size of a small island.
 
**Merlin:**
But their target was a god. He wouldn't die easily. So the fairies devised a plan and held a festival.
 
**Merlin:**
They said they would enshrine the Celtic beast god as their own deity. They held a feast and fed him wine.
 
**Merlin:**
Cernunnos was overjoyed to be worshipped as a god.
 
**Merlin:**
He probably thought the fairies were finally repenting for their deeds.
 
**Merlin:**
Despite his priestess' cries against it, Cernunnos accepted the feast...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
...and was killed by the poisoned wine. And so the festival came to an end.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And the priestess that was left behind...?
 
**Merlin:**
The fairies used her as the basis—no, as the origin of the “humans” that came later.
 
**Merlin:**
Every human in Britain's Lostbelt is a “degraded copy” of the priestess that was killed during the time of creation.
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
The six fairies were A-Rei, so they created “Children of Stone” and “Children of the Forest” to increase their clans,
 
**Merlin:**
while more and more of Cernunnos' corpse was turned into land.
 
**Merlin:**
But, life became hard for the fairies after 100 years.
 
**Merlin:**
Their children started to die. And after they died, they drifted away into the ocean like fallen trees.
 
**Merlin:**
The number of fairies didn't decrease because the next generations would be born.
 
**Merlin:**
And there were copies of humans made from the priestess' cells. So, bit by bit, civilization was created.
 
**Merlin:**
As civilization was built up, the number of roles to play increased, there were more varieties of fairy, and the forests flourished.
 
**Merlin:**
Still, they were dying. For no reason at all.
 
**Merlin:**
The six fairies finally realized that this was Cernunnos' anger at them.
 
**Merlin:**
Cernunnos' soul had been extinguished, but his body hadn't fully died.
 
**Merlin:**
For you see, the flames that consumed only his heart had not yet gone out.
 
**Merlin:**
Cernunnos' corpse even now still seethes with rage and curses.
 
**Merlin:**
He was in a state where he could come back to life at any time.
 
**Merlin:**
The fairies were astonished, and fled from Cernunnos' corpse.
 
**Merlin:**
Fortunately, at that time the bodies of their children were starting to form new lands.
 
**Merlin:**
To put it simply, fairy bodies are made up of the material of planets.
 
**Merlin:**
The fallen trees became earth and rocks, rapidly reclaiming the sea to hide their own sin.
 
**Merlin:**
And so the island of Britain became a Lostbelt that spread by use of fairy remains.
 
**Merlin:**
It took the fairies one or two thousand years to obtain a Britain of their very own.
 
**Merlin:**
Meanwhile&mdash;Cernunnos' body remained.
 
**Merlin:**
The tomb of the god that prevented the ocean from being filled with fallen trees.
 
**Merlin:**
It refused the corpses of the fairies, as evidence of their lingering sin.
 
**Merlin:**
Before long, one of the fallen trees dammed up the water, and Cernunnos' body was left at the bottom of the ocean.
 
**Merlin:**
That's what the Great Pit really is. It's not a pit at all, but a dried-up ocean.
 
**Mash:**
An island created by killing a god...the fairies' original sin...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Not only did they kill the god...but also the priestess that served him.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No...she was reduced to little more than a tool. For fourteen thousand years.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No wonder Cernunnos is so pissed. Killing all the fairies in Britain won't be enough for him.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But...why did Cernunnos come to Earth in the first place? He came down of his own free will, didn't he?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Isn't it a bit too narrow-minded to curse the entire world because you got killed after being mixed up with fairies?
 
**Artoria:**
That's probably...
 
**Artoria:**
...because Cernunnos was the “Envoy of Paradise” who was sent to scold the fairies.
 
**Artoria:**
Cernunnos came down to Earth to punish the fairies from the very beginning.
 
**Artoria:**
As this mural shows, Cernunnos is a gentle god...
 
**Artoria:**
He didn't want to go through with punishing them, but...
 
**Artoria:**
From the fairies' viewpoint, his mere being there was terrifying...probably.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It originally came there to scold them...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't mean the reason the world became an empty ocean...
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Yes. How it became a Lostbelt in the first place. The greatest mistake of them all.
 
**Merlin:**
For you humans, 14,000 years ago was the greatest turning point in history.
 
**Merlin:**
You've heard of Olympus, right? The story of the “planet” that destroyed the prehistoric ancient civilizations?
 
**Mash:**
Yes. The civilization-destroying White Titan that fell from a shooting star—Sefar.
 
**Mash:**
It laid waste to many mythological cultures, and nearly wiped out all civilizations on Earth.
 
**Mash:**
But in the end, it was defeated not by the gods, but by a human. They wielded the power of a Divine Construct&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Items said to be forged in the Inner Sea of the Planet for the purpose of opposing “that which threatens the planet.”
 
**Mash:**
The Holy Sword Excalibur is the greatest of these, and originated here in Britain&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;here in Britain&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;and yet nobody ever spoke of it up until now.
 
**Mash:**
It's as if the concept of “Holy Sword” doesn't exist on this version of Britain.
 
**Mash:**
So that means&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Excalibur was never forged?|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But they have Arondight and Galatine.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Those are fakes. Just the names taken from the Round Table Knights of pan-human history.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Barghest's Galatine is just her horn, and Mélusine's Arondight is just a crystallization of magical energy.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No Holy Sword was ever forged in this Britain... that's what he's talking about.
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Yep. You can probably guess how well that worked out for them.
 
**Merlin:**
The humans of this world had no way to defeat Sefar.
 
**Merlin:**
So they died out. All of the land was razed and reclaimed by the ocean,
 
**Merlin:**
leaving behind the Ocean of Emptiness, with nothing but a few aquatic organisms remaining.
 
**Merlin:**
Why wasn't the Holy Sword forged, you ask? The answer is very simple, and one you can probably relate to pretty well.
 
**Merlin:**
“Can't we just skip work for once?”
 
**Merlin:**
The six fairies were the A-Rei in charge of forging the Holy Sword in the Inner Sea of the Planet...
 
**Merlin:**
But they all got together and decided it was all right to slack off, and so they did.
 
**Merlin:**
After that, they came to realize something was amiss, so they went to Earth's surface to become aware of the consequences of their actions.
 
**Merlin:**
But they couldn't change what had happened, and they wouldn't admit it was their fault the world ended.
 
**Merlin:**
As the only god who had taken refuge in Paradise for the sake of his priestess&mdash;
 
**Merlin:**
Cernunnos was sent as their supervisor. To make them repent for their sins.
 
**Merlin:**
So they killed him, along with his priestess, the last human.
 
**Merlin:**
At that point, they were no longer able to return to the Inner Sea.
 
**Merlin:**
“Only those without sin may pass&mdash;” The only fairies that can go to Paradise are the innocent.
 
**Merlin:**
The same goes for the descendants of the six fairies, the “fairies of Britain”.
 
**Merlin:**
No matter who they are, they can't enter the Inner Sea. Continuing to suffer on that cursed island of sin became their atonement.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
With just one act of sabotage&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This Lostbelt was born
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Yes. Everything started because the Holy Sword was never forged.
 
**Merlin:**
In order to rectify this mistake, a fairy from the Inner Sea was selected and sent to Earth.
 
**Merlin:**
The first of them was Vivian. And the second was you, Caster.
 
**Merlin:**
Your mission was to get the six clans to admit to their sin, and to inherit the Mystery of the Holy Sword's creation.
 
**Merlin:**
The Pilgrim's Bells indicate that the clan leaders acknowledge their guilt, and the fairy who rings them all becomes the Holy Sword itself.
 
**Merlin:**
Vivian refused to do this and became Morgan.
 
**Merlin:**
If the Holy Sword is created, the foundation of this Lostbelt will no longer be.
 
**Merlin:**
Caster. When you rang the bell in Orkney, you should have come to realize this.
 
**Merlin:**
Moreover, you never stopped advancing, defeated Morgan, and came here together with Fujimaru.
 
**Merlin:**
You must have had many worries and doubts.
 
**Merlin:**
You probably still have them, and they may never be fully resolved.
 
**Merlin:**
But I believe that all the battles you fought getting here are the way things should be.
 
**Merlin:**
&mdash;Well then. It's been quite a journey, but we're almost at the end.
 
**Merlin:**
Ahead of you awaits the final dragon, whose beliefs will challenge your qualifications.
 
**Merlin:**
“Only those without sin may pass&mdash;”
 
**Merlin:**
It's not about the original sin you carry from birth, or the sins you commit.
 
**Merlin:**
What will you do now? Where will your hearts go to now?
 
**Merlin:**
The theory for life to exist as a living organism. The principle of survival and prosperity.
 
**Merlin:**
The land of hope will only be open to those who demonstrate those certainties and strengths.
 
**???:**
&mdash;Ruin. &mdash;The whole surface world in ruin.
 
**???:**
&mdash;The sky, the sea, life...All to which that I bore witness.
 
**???:**
&mdash;There will be no need for my records to accumulate anymore.
 
**???:**
&mdash;There will be no need for my joy to be renewed anymore.
 
**???:**
&mdash;He who chooses the bearer of the Holy Sword. He who chants the name of the King.
 
**???:**
&mdash;If you would seek the new world, leave the old one behind.
 
**???:**
&mdash;My name is ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■. The last dragon, who chose to continue flying above the Earth rather than return to the Inner Sea.
 
**???:**
&mdash;If you can go beyond these tears, I would devote my heart to the one who will reforge the star.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**■ ■ ■ ■ ■:**
Aah...I hear the tolling of bells.
 
**■ ■ ■ ■ ■:**
My heartbeat has ceased to drum, but yours is yet true.
 
**■ ■ ■ ■ ■:**
Welcome back, O Fairy of Paradise, Avalon le Fae. May that hope resound into the future&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that...light from the outside?|
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Indeed. This is the entrance to the Inner Sea of the Planet.
 
**Merlin:**
The realm of everlasting youth, the eternal spring. The answer to the dream many have sought.
 
**Merlin:**
Welcome to a paradise overflowing with time—Avalon. The journey to the birth of a planet ends here.
 
## Section 28: The Moment a Planet is Born 
 
**Artoria:**
So this is the Inner Sea of the Planet&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
The land King Arthur left for after he died in pan-human history—Avalon&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The whole thing is a flower garden...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The air, the wind...everything is so warm and gentle...
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
It sure is, isn't it? There's no such thing as “evil” in Paradise.
 
**Merlin:**
It's another land that will never be influenced by how much the outside world is ruined.
 
**Merlin:**
Here there is nothing but hope. Hope to bring you and this planet to a happy ending.
 
**Merlin:**
A workshop for weaving together every single possibility.
 
**Merlin:**
Still, this is only a remainder of the real thing. It's nothing but a shadow reflected in the British Lostbelt.
 
**Merlin:**
It doesn't have the tower I'm trapped in or a lake where the fairies gather, and the mana is thinner than the real thing.
 
**Merlin:**
All that's here is the “Site of Selection”&mdash;
 
**Merlin:**
Where the Holy Sword should have been forged by the six fairies.
 
**Mash:**
The “Site of Selection”...is it anything like the rock where the Sword of Selection was stuck in Arthurian lore?
 
**Mash:**
Where the squire Arthur drew the sword and showed his fate as King,
 
**Mash:**
after being raised as Sir Ector's adopted son?
 
**Merlin:**
Yeah...their meaning is basically the same. My job is to guide you all there.
 
**Merlin:**
See that altar over that hill over there? That's where we're going.
 
**Merlin:**
It's a short trip in terms of distance. But there are a few hurdles to get over on the way.
 
**Merlin:**
Avalon's defenses...actually, you could think of it as your final test.
 
**Merlin:**
The past deeds of the Fairy of Paradise are materialized as obstacles.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What she did in the past, meaning...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What she's done since birth?
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
That's right. What she's done with the time she's had... an album of her life, both affirming it and burying her past.
 
**Merlin:**
It's quite a journey that begins with a harsh, cold “winter” and ends with a warm, enjoyable “spring”.
 
**Merlin:**
In the past, the first obstacle was always the hardest to get through.
 
**Merlin:**
Your role, Fujimaru, will be to get rid of these obstacles and make sure the Fairy of Paradise can proceed.
 
**Merlin:**
It'll be fine. You're going in decreasing order of difficulty, so it'll only get easier as you go along.
 
**Merlin:**
Let me say it once more, the Fairy of Paradise's job is to forge the Holy Sword.
 
**Merlin:**
With this, Britain's Lostbelt will lose its origin point, and human history will be stabilized.
 
**Merlin:**
Without its Fantasy Tree, this Lostbelt will probably just fade away, just like all the others.
 
**Merlin:**
More importantly, forging the Holy Sword is vital to the protection of human history.
 
**Merlin:**
If this Britain were to merge with pan-human history, we'd end up with a world without the Holy Sword.
 
**Merlin:**
Should that happen, the path to defeating the Alien God will be closed off.
 
**Merlin:**
But the Alien God can't stop the collapse either, so the match would be called off due to injury... or would that be a tie game?
 
**Merlin:**
Anyway, that's all there is to explain. Do you have any questions?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria's mission is to forge the Holy Sword...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(But that will probably...)
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Wh-why do you look so serious, Fujimaru!?
 
**Artoria:**
There's no need for you to worry! I'm still the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Artoria:**
This is the moment I've fought for. I rang the bells to get here.
 
**Artoria:**
In the first place, I knew my mission was to forge the Holy Sword after I rang the fourth bell at Orkney.
 
**Artoria:**
I planned to come here alone after Knocknarea became queen.
 
**Artoria:**
So&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
So don't worry too much about it.
 
**Artoria:**
Besides, Chaldea needs a Divine Construct, right?
 
**Artoria:**
Then we have to hurry. I will protect Britain where I have led my life.
 
**Artoria:**
And you're going to reclaim your own world.
 
**Artoria:**
We both have things we need to do. The time for them has come, that's all.
 
**Artoria:**
This is the end of our journey. We fulfilled our pilgrimage to the very end.
 
**Artoria:**
Let's head for the Site of Selection, Fujimaru.
 
**Artoria:**
We finally made it to Avalon, so it would be a waste not to enjoy it! I'm counting on you to escort me!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Still, just flowers as far as the eye can see. It's the complete opposite of seeing Britain covered in flames.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Having eternal youth means not worrying over your next meal. Not fussing over time or lifespan either, doesn't it?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So there's no hatred or strife here.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
If there's no need to take anything from others, then there's no temptation to be up to mischief.
 
**Merlin:**
You're right. Everything you could ever desire is here, so you don't have to work to compensate for anything.
 
**Merlin:**
It's hugely different from the Lostbelt, where “emptiness” had to be filled with the corpses of fairies.
 
**Merlin:**
Speaking of which, this is a good opportunity to talk about what's happening up there.
 
**Merlin:**
The prophecy talks about two Calamities. The “Black” and the “Red.”
 
**Merlin:**
But the number of Calamities isn't fixed. Be sure to remember that.
 
**Merlin:**
So long as the root cause isn't taken care of, new Calamities will arise.
 
**Merlin:**
Cernunnos&mdash;until his neverending punishment of the fairies is stopped, the Calamities will never end.
 
**Merlin:**
And thanks to Morgan's efforts, fairies born in the Fairy Kingdom became able to emigrate to pan-human history.
 
**Merlin:**
The Calamities won't just affect Britain. They'll spread across the bleached Earth, and incinerate pan-human history.
 
**Merlin:**
It'll be just like the King of Mages' incineration of the Human Order, but on a smaller scale.
 
**Merlin:**
Before that, you will have to defeat all the Calamities before you.
 
**Mash:**
Cernunnos' curse must not be allowed to spread any further...
 
**Mash:**
We have to stop the Calamities while we're still in Britain, then.
 
**Merlin:**
Yeah, something like that.
 
**Merlin:**
The Calamity that's raging across Britain right now is the Great Calamity that should have happened 1,000 years ago.
 
**Merlin:**
The Calamity that Morgan managed to avert was passed on to the fairies of the Fang Clan.
 
**Merlin:**
The chieftess of the Black Dogs, Barghest. She's no longer a fairy.
 
**Merlin:**
The Black Calamity...it's become a Calamity of Beasts, burning the entire island.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Barghest is...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Yes. This was predictable. She was born as a Child of Calamity.
 
**Merlin:**
That was why Morgan bestowed the gifted name on her, to contain it. So long as she remained as Gawain, she would never become the demon dog.
 
**Merlin:**
But even that had its limit.
 
**Merlin:**
Barghest had already reached it, whether or not you had defeated her.
 
**Merlin:**
If anything, it's a wonder she held it back for so long.
 
**Merlin:**
When you return to the surface, Cernunnos won't be the only one you'll have to fight.
 
**Merlin:**
I'm sorry to tell you this, but you need to be prepared for that.
 
**Merlin:**
Like I said, you can't let a Calamity get off the island.
 
**Merlin:**
The plan of resettling the fairies wasn't a bad one.
 
**Merlin:**
It's just that she can't. She was never able to from the start.
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Merlin:**
Meanwhile, there's another Calamity...
 
**Merlin:**
However, defeating Cernunnos should be pretty straightforward.
 
**Merlin:**
He's just a corpse that hasn't realized it's dead yet. His soul was destroyed 14,000 years ago.
 
**Merlin:**
But he was a pretty strong god originally. His flesh has bloated over the years, so now it's as thick as the Spirit Cave that led you here.
 
**Merlin:**
It's a layer of curses as thick as 400 kilometers of the stratum of this planet. Lifting those curses would take more than the spells crafted by the God of Wisdom and Chaldea's strength combined.
 
**Merlin:**
An opponent that can barely be exorcised by utilizing an anti-Cernunnos Divine Construct.
 
**Merlin:**
You know, you have almost no chance of winning when I think about it.
 
**Merlin:**
I can't leave Avalon either, so showing you the way like this is the most help I can provide.
 
**Merlin:**
Oh, crap. I was hoping to avoid a story that would only lead to crushing defeat.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The great magician Merlin has no plan at all!?
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
It sure looks that way, doesn't it? It sure would be convenient if I had a god-killing weapon just laying around.
 
**Artoria:**
No! We already have a trump card against Cernunnos! It'll be easy!
 
**Mash:**
We do? What do you...?
 
**Artoria:**
<span style=font-size:25px>It's Muramasa! </span>
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Hah?
 
**Artoria:**
You said it before, didn't you? “I can cut anything, so long as it's a god.”
 
**Artoria:**
You were bragging about how you sliced some amazing god right in half back in...uh, Olympus, was it?
 
**Artoria:**
Then you can do it here too! Make up for your bad streaking at Camelot!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Artoria. It's "break a bad streak."|
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;O-oh, I see. Is that how it's said in pan-human history? You learn something every day.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of courseMuramasa!
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well...I could give it a shot if you asked me to, but...
 
**Artoria:**
Yeah! You go and do it, Muramasa! Just like you said!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
&mdash;Sheesh. There's that selfish streak I was talking about.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I can't make any promises, though. Don't get your hopes up, alright?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Artoria!?
 
**Mash:**
Master, Artoria has vanished! Is this one of the aforementioned “obstacles”!?
 
**Merlin:**
Yeah. She's reached the first one. She's being confronted with her memories right now.
 
**Merlin:**
While she's doing that, you're going to have to fight and overcome this.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Merlin, what is that!?|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is thata wyvern, in Avalon!?
 
**Merlin:**
Close, but no cigar! Get yourself together!
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
That's an abstract and radical materialization of her 'winter memories'.
 
**Merlin:**
She won't come out of her memories unless that thing is defeated.
 
**Merlin:**
You've come this far, so it shouldn't be that big of a deal. Just go ahead and cut loose on it.
 
**Merlin:**
Of course, I'll help you out here.
 
**Merlin:**
It's been quite a while. I want to see how much you and Mash have grown.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Somehow, it really...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Feels sickening...
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Well, that's to be expected.
 
**Merlin:**
That just now was a memory of the most painful time in her life.
 
**Merlin:**
We may never know what it was, but by defeating it, some of those feelings were shared with us.
 
**Artoria:**
Hmm? Where were you all? I was worried because you suddenly disappeared...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You're the one who disappeared. We were here with those bizarre Mors.
 
**Merlin:**
No, no, it's fine, Muramasa. The right people in the right place, as they say.
 
**Merlin:**
She has to purify herself to enter the Site of Selection, while we eliminate the obstacles that stand in the way.
 
**Merlin:**
Let's do this three more times solemnly, why don't we?
 
**Merlin:**
Even if there's something you want to say, save it for when we get to the Site of Selection.
 
**Artoria:**
You said it! It's also easier for me if I don't have to fight! Let's get a move on!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;Whenever I shut my eyes, I would always find myself here.
 
**Narration:**
I would tremble, just like this, whether awake or asleep.
 
**Narration:**
Whoosh. Whoosh. The ear-shattering sound of the wind.
 
**Narration:**
I had nothing to cover myself with, and so my body was as cold as stone.
 
**Narration:**
I was surrounded by pitch black darkness, with no source of warmth to find, and no place to go.
 
**Narration:**
Such was the scenery I saw. For me, Britain was nothing short of hell.
 
**Mother:**
The prophecy held true.
 
**Mother:**
Now we will be saved. Now we will be forgiven.
 
**Mother:**
The savior who drifted ashore, bearing the name 'Artoria'.
 
**Mother:**
I pray you grow strong and healthy until your sixteenth year. I pray the Queen’s soldiers do not find you.
 
**Mother:**
&mdash;Now. Quick, quick, quick, quick.
 
**Mother:**
You must turn sixteen as quickly as possible.
 
**Mother:**
We put all our faith in you. You must devote everything you have to us.
 
**Narration:**
The boat that drifted ashore carried a plentiful stash of treasures and a little, newborn fairy.
 
**C：Village Fairy:**
Now there's something you don't see everyday. There's no doubt about it, this girl is the Child of Prophecy!
 
**D：Village Fairy:**
Can't say I'm too happy about an omen like this. We're done for if Her Majesty finds out!
 
**Narration:**
Despite the village fairies differing in their opinions, they all reached the same conclusion.
 
**Village Fairies:**
“Either way, the Child of Prophecy will be of use. Let's raise her until she turns sixteen.”
 
**Village Fairies:**
“But she's a Fairy of Paradise, isn't she? How unpleasant. She'll definitely look down on us!”
 
**Village Fairies:**
“A normal roof's too good for her. What do humans do at a time like this?”
 
**Village Fairies:**
“Oh, I know! They'd raise her like livestock! Let's build a lovely stable!”
 
**Village Fairies:**
“If we tell them we're raising horses, even the other villages won't find out! The Child of Prophecy belongs to us alone!”
 
**Narration:**
I was cherished at Tintagel.
 
**Narration:**
I possessed very little magical energy, so the villagers were all worried for me.
 
**Village Fairy:**
To think you'd only have this much magical energy, even though four years have passed...how pitiful... you're no different than a human like this.
 
**Village Fairy:**
To think you cannot do anything special. I'm worried. Is this this girl even going to survive?
 
**Village Fairy:**
Oh, I get it. We need to train her properly.
 
**Village Fairy:**
Even more strictly, even more carefully. To the point she won't even have time to sleep.
 
**Village Fairy:**
Forgive us, Caster. We're all doing this for you.
 
**Village Fairy:**
Right now, being the Child of Prophecy is an unreachable dream. There's no time for you to be having dreams in your sleep.
 
**Village Fairy:**
We really need you to grow up a bit.
 
**Village Fairy:**
At this rate, they won't believe in you, even once you turn sixteen. Because they'd just about mistake you for a human!
 
**Village Fairy:**
Things like overthrowing Her Majesty don't matter. What matters is that you hold 'value'.
 
**Village Fairy:**
To at least seem like the Child of Prophecy, even if you're not the real deal.
 
**Village Fairy:**
We can get our hands on a lot of money that way. Who in their right mind would shelter a Fairy of Paradise otherwise?
 
**Village Fairy:**
We just have to raise her such that she doesn't die. She's a weak fairy anyway, so it's not like she can escape.
 
**Narration:**
But the village fairies did not know that my eyes were those of 'Fairy Eyes'.
 
**Narration:**
That I could see their unspoken, true intentions. Even against my own will.
 
**Narration:**
I saw that deep down inside, everyone feared and hated me.
 
**Narration:**
The fearful fairies truly believed in the Child of Prophecy, and that is why they abused me.
 
**Narration:**
The hateful fairies loathed the Fairy of Paradise, and they mistreated me as a matter of course.
 
**Narration:**
Other than that, they were mostly indifferent.
 
**Narration:**
While being cherished in the village, I was simultaneously treated as something both there and not there.
 
**Narration:**
Even so, it mattered not. Somehow, I was always aware of my mission.
 
**Narration:**
“Deliver salvation unto the fairies of Britain. Grant them righteous salvation so that they may be absolved from their suffering.”
 
**Narration:**
And I knew...even as a child, I knew doing so would result in the destruction of the Britain we all knew.
 
**Narration:**
I could bear the abuse, the mistreatment, and the indifference as long as there was a reason behind them. However, this sound was the only thing I couldn't bear.
 
**Narration:**
I heard it at all times. When I shut my eyes. Even when asleep.
 
**Narration:**
“Deception,” “self-preservation,” “selfishness,” “envy”. All that they were, I could hear their true hearts.
 
**Narration:**
I lost sight of where I was and where I was supposed to go.
 
**Narration:**
I hear the tolling of bells. They tell me to set out on a pilgrimage to save the fairies.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;Sigh. Truth be told, this sound is also a depressing one.
 
**Narration:**
I'm sure it's a noble mission. But isn't it far too unreasonable to ask me to save all the fairies like that?
 
**Artoria:**
Oryaa&ndash;! Torya&ndash;! Die&ndash;!
 
**Narration:**
And so, I trained intensely yet again that day at a field near the village.
 
**Narration:**
I underwent intensive close-quarters combat training yet again, using the Staff of Selection that was on the boat as a weapon.
 
**Narration:**
After all, I couldn't use a Fairy Territory! And hitting things is about the only thing you can do with a staff!
 
**Artoria:**
Toa&ndash;! Toaaa&ndash;!
 
**Artoria:**
Toaaaaa&ndash;!!!! Haa...
 
**Artoria:**
Haha...ahahahahahaha...
 
**Narration:**
I fell on my back all of a sudden. It was in the early afternoon of my sixth year.
 
**Narration:**
The only time I had to myself, free from the village's surveillance (not that I could escape anyway), was during intensive physical training.
 
**Artoria:**
Ahahahaha...haa...ah...
 
**Narration:**
And as though matching my voice, fading away all alone in the field:
 
**???:**
Ahh...aaaaaa, how disgusting! The fairies you're with disgust me!
 
**Artoria:**
Ah!? T-the staff spoke!?
 
**???:**
Not quite. I'm not the Staff of Selection.
 
**???:**
Tintagel was just too nauseating and you were just too pliant for me,
 
**???:**
and so I spoke up. I'm just a meddler, that's all.
 
**???:**
Good grief, I had no intention of getting involved like this. But I suppose there's no helping it now.
 
**???:**
Listen carefully now, I am Merlin. Merlin, the Magus of Flowers.
 
**Merlin:**
I'll be your mentor going forward. Keep that in mind.
 
**Narration:**
That was how I met Merlin, the 'voice I heard from the Staff of Selection'.
 
**Narration:**
That was how I started down the path of a mage.
 
**Artoria:**
M a g e c r a f t! I know, it's the art employed by Her Majesty Queen Morgan!
 
**Artoria:**
But...what exactly do you mean by that? What are you going to teach me?
 
**Merlin:**
What...magecraft, of course. Merlin's magecraft. I'll have you know it's amazing.
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, I want to fly in the sky! Vrooom, like a bird!
 
**Merlin:**
Fly in the sky...fly in the sky, huh...you're setting a high bar all of a sudden...
 
**Artoria:**
You can't do it? Are you a greenhorn?
 
**Merlin:**
No, I can. It is but a trivial matter. After all, I am the renowned Merlin.
 
**Merlin:**
But we'll get to that later, Artoria. Even the Wind Clan cannot roam the skies.
 
**Merlin:**
The skies are the domain of dragons. Only a select few of the elite fairies can take flight there.
 
**Merlin:**
It's better to start with something a little more down-to-earth. Something that'd make your life easier.
 
**Merlin:**
What would you like to have right now? Go ahead, tell me.
 
**Artoria:**
In that case...some warmth at night sounds great, I suppose.
 
**Artoria:**
My house can get very cold.
 
**Artoria:**
It freezes up in the winter. Last year, I lost two of my toes.
 
**Artoria:**
Ehehe...it's rather embarrassing though so I'm keeping it a secret from everyone!
 
**Merlin:**
&mdash;Alright, I'll go stud&ndash;ahem, make preparations.
 
**Merlin:**
You'll need to wait three, no, two days. I'll go fetch some instructional materials for you.
 
**Artoria:**
???
 
**Narration:**
I learned a lot about magecraft from Merlin.
 
**Narration:**
Heating, tracking, first aid, wordcraft, mimicry, lock picking, ambush, explosives, barriers.
 
**Narration:**
Whenever I wanted to learn some new magecraft,
 
**Narration:**
“Now's not a good time. Wait until our next lesson.”
 
**Narration:**
is what he would say as we made magical tools together. This would later go on to become the basis of Merlin's magecraft.
 
**Narration:**
I'm sure he must have concocted a number of ways so that even someone like me, lacking in magical energy, could use magecraft.
 
**Artoria:**
But why are you teaching me magecraft? All the fairies in Britain hate me.
 
**Merlin:**
That would be because I'm not a fairy of Britain. Well, take that as a joke.
 
**Merlin:**
You are a Fairy of Paradise, no matter what the village fairies may think. In time, you will have many fairies as followers.
 
**Merlin:**
For when that time comes, you must become your ideal&mdash;
 
**Merlin:**
No, you must become a convenient savior befitting the wish everyone has of you. One of fantasy.
 
**Artoria:**
Fantasy?
 
**Merlin:**
Yes. In the vein of a fairy tale-like existence.
 
**Merlin:**
It differs from person to person. A mighty king, a gentle king, a terrifying king. There are lots.
 
**Merlin:**
But you must become someone capable of taking on all of that.
 
**Merlin:**
The thing from which all those wishes stem. No, rather, the thing which joins them.
 
**Merlin:**
People differ in what they wish to perceive. That's why a fixed name will only get in your way.
 
**Merlin:**
You need to be a nameless king, so to speak. Not one who exists at the center of the world, but rather, at the edge of it...
 
**Merlin:**
Like a lighthouse in the farthest ends of the world, a sign of hope for people just by its sheer existence&mdash;
 
**Merlin:**
The starlight that acts as a glimmer of hope. That's the sort of king I'd like you to be.
 
**Merlin:**
Even in foreign lands, even at the end of time. Inspiring the people from atop the ramparts, you know.
 
**Artoria:**
Is it even possible to be like that...?
 
**Merlin:**
Sure, what's impossible in reality is possible in fantasy.
 
**Merlin:**
And people have always realized their fantasies. A dream-like future will eventually cease to be just a dream☆
 
**Narration:**
Merlin was an exceedingly garrulous and entertaining person.
 
**Narration:**
But that came to an end after a year.
 
**Narration:**
A fairy girl spotted me laughing in the field and reported it to the village chief.
 
**Narration:**
They confiscated the Staff of Selection until the day of departure when I turned sixteen.
 
**Narration:**
The days that followed only got worse.
 
**Narration:**
That concludes my winter memories.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Narration:**
This happened around when I was twelve years old.
 
**Village Leader:**
You're twelve too? You've grown up so well.
 
**Village Leader:**
Hm...I suppose I have an errand for you to run.
 
**Village Leader:**
I'm worried about sending you off on your own, but you've toughened up a bit since you started using magecraft.
 
**Village Leader:**
You know Cape Drift? There's an Earth Clan fairy that lives alone there.
 
**Village Leader:**
Deliver this to him for me. Just make sure to be back by sundown.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Wait a second. You don't mean...that house&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
There was no mistaking it.
 
**Narration:**
That house alone on the cape was the workshop of the craftsman Merlin had talked about. A theme park of iron.
 
**Narration:**
One day I'd definitely go there! Number one on the list of things that didn't exist in Tintagel...
 
**Artoria:**
A blacksmith&mdash;!
 
**Artoria:**
Whooooah&mdash;! Whoooa&mdash;!
 
**Artoria:**
Woooooow! Amaaaaaaazing&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
Even I have to say my state of mind at the time was a bit off.
 
**Narration:**
I had never seen anybody acting suspicious before. Actually, I probably came across as a robber.
 
**Narration:**
So...
 
**Earth Fairy:**
Whaaaat do you think you're doing, girl!? You want me to smash your head open and toss your body into the sea!?
 
**Artoria:**
Aaaaaaah!?
 
**Narration:**
And as you can see, at our first meeting I gave him the worst possible impression.
 
**Narration:**
His name was Ector. A smith of the Earth Clan.
 
**Narration:**
He was an eccentric who had lived alone on the cape for hundreds of years, feared by everyone in the village.
 
**Narration:**
He was stubborn and scary-looking, but he never once lied to me, and respected me as a friend.
 
**Ector:**
Hmph. A Tintagel-made leather bag, huh? You're not taking iron, you're bringing...
 
**Ector:**
So you're not a thief. Hmph. A delivery from the village chief, huh?
 
**Ector:**
What is it? You're mumbling. I can't hear you! Speak loudly and clearly!
 
**Narration:**
Ector had poor hearing, so I had to exaggerate my speech to get my intent across.
 
**Narration:**
What's more, he hated fairies. Both his emotional state and the voice of his heart were black with disgust.
 
**Narration:**
“If I stay here, he'll kill me. He'll really split my skull with that hammer.”
 
**Narration:**
The excitement of seeing his workshop faded, and I decided to just leave the bag and run back home.
 
**Narration:**
But...
 
**Ector:**
&mdash;Wait. Let me see your face. You're&mdash;
 
**Ector:**
&mdash;the Child of Prophecy, aren't you?
 
**Ector:**
I see. It's already been twelve years since Ainsel's prophecy.
 
**Ector:**
Hurry up and get back to your village. This is no place for little girls.
 
**Ector:**
The whole reason I live out here is because I don't want to be bothered by anyone.
 
**Ector:**
Never come back here, you got it!? I don't have time to be bothered by the Child of Prophecy, or anyone else!
 
**Artoria:**
Y-y-yes, sir! I'm sorry to bother you~!
 
**Narration:**
And so I scurried out of his house. After all, he threw a hammer at me.
 
**Narration:**
I left the cape and made my way back to Tintagel.
 
**Narration:**
I trudged the whole way, and my pace was even more listless than usual.
 
**Narration:**
And then I went back.  
 
**Ector:**
I told you not to come back. Why are you here? Why don't you listen?
 
**Ector:**
Are all the fairies who look like you hogs or bears?
 
**Ector:**
Don't touch that! That's wrought iron, it makes fairies break out in hives...
 
**Ector:**
...but not you, huh? I see. You look like Wind Clan, but you're actually Demon Boar Clan.
 
**Narration:**
Obviously, there was no such clan.
 
**Ector:**
You're not afraid of the furnace or the iron? What, you interested?
 
**Ector:**
I see.
 
**Ector:**
I see.
 
**Ector:**
You've been coming around frequently. Well, the villagers probably don't want me coming around.
 
**Ector:**
Your clothes are all kinds of ragged. You got lots of pocket space, but the stitching and finishing is pretty shoddy.
 
**Ector:**
Hmph...hey, tell the village chief.
 
**Ector:**
“Send her by to assist me, and I'll teach her a little.”
 
**Artoria:**
Ector, do you mean...!?
 
**Ector:**
Don't call me that! Just “smith” or “old man” is fine!
 
**Ector:**
Come once every other day, you got it!?
 
**Ector:**
Sheesh...I don't know who taught you that, but even the way you hold the tools is dangerous.
 
**Ector:**
You don't even know the basics. If you die messily. then it'll reflect badly on smiths everywhere.
 
**Ector:**
If you're interested in smithing, then I'll train you from the ground up.
 
**Ector:**
Naturally, there's no tuition fee. Just pay me back when you make it big.
 
**Narration:**
My training for my journey as the Child of Prophecy had taken one more step.
 
**Narration:**
Ector was scary, but he was actually quite good at finely detailed craftsmanship and clothing.
 
**Narration:**
One year after I started helping him, Ector was a master craftsman, renowned by a select few.
 
**Narration:**
He received special orders not just from villages in southwest Britain, but also Salisbury and Oxford.
 
**Narration:**
Sometimes from as far away as Manchester.
 
**Narration:**
For example...
 
**Blonde Fairy:**
Excuse me. Is Master Ector here?
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
It was the first time a customer had come directly to his workshop.
 
**Narration:**
I was the assistant, so I received her properly in order to build up Ector's reputation.
 
**Blonde Fairy:**
Master Ector, I am Gawain, the one who sent the letter. Are you here?
 
**Narration:**
She completely ignored me. Had she not heard me, or was it intentional?
 
**Ector:**
So you're Gawain? Never thought I'd see a Fairy Knight again.
 
**Ector:**
You're well-tempered...You probably won't lose to the armor.
 
**Ector:**
It's in the back. Try it on, and if there aren't any issues, we'll box it up for you.
 
**Ector:**
Give me a hand, Artoria. This is high-grade stuff, so make sure not to drop it.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
No, that won't be necessary. If it fits well when I try it on, I'll make use of it starting today.
 
**Ector:**
I see. Then come over here. Artoria, go tidy up the workshop.
 
**Narration:**
I could hear the clanging of armor being donned in the back room, as well as Ector conversing with her.
 
**Narration:**
She was a highborn member of the Fang Clan, chosen to become a Fairy Knight.
 
**Narration:**
She was huge, strong, and acted polite and respectful in a way that wouldn't be out of place in Gloucester's upper crust.
 
**Narration:**
On top of that, she was rich enough to afford that silver armor that Ector had spent the last four years working on.
 
**Artoria:**
...
 
**Narration:**
It kind of pissed me off.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
What excellent work. You have my heartfelt appreciation, Master Ector.
 
**Ector:**
Hmph. It was a job worth doing. The only one I've had since I came here, I'd say.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Is that so?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
A craftsman of your skill would be in high demand in any city.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It may be disrespectful of me to ask, but...we are still without a large workshop in my own city.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
If you don't mind, Master Ector...
 
**Artoria:**
Huuuuuh!? What the heck are you saying!?
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
What was that odd sound just now? Was it an overgrown toad...or perhaps a nachtkrapp?
 
**Ector:**
Stay out of this, you idiot! Are you trying to pick a fight with a Fairy Knight!?
 
**Artoria:**
B-b-but Ect&ndash;old man, she's too arrogant to think she can up and recruit you!
 
**Narration:**
I had a bad habit of talking back around there. I'm sure it was Merlin's fault.
 
**Narration:**
But I really was mad at the time, so I crowded the Fairy Knight and tried to get her to leave.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
So you're Master Ector's apprentice...
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
It's not like I don't understand how you feel. Parting with a fine teacher is sad.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
In deference to your feelings, I will overlook your vulgar language just now.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
However...In any case, please try and grow up a little more before you speak to me.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Because of my height, my neck does ache from dealing with small things.
 
**Fairy Knight Gawain:**
Well, I suppose with a body like that you can only imagine it.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
And just like that, she left.
 
**Narration:**
It was like she forgot all about me after we spoke.
 
**Narration:**
The signature on the sales voucher she gave to Ector didn't say Gawain, but ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■.
 
**Narration:**
It was as if a strange curse was making it impossible to read, but no truth can escape me.
 
**Narration:**
Hmph. I'll never forget that name!
 
**Ector:**
She has a point. I've been teaching you for a little under four years now.
 
**Ector:**
You may be my apprentice, but you're a full-fledged blacksmith now. There's nothing to be done about your low magical energy.
 
**Ector:**
What about the village fairies? Do they still believe you're the Child of Prophecy?
 
**Artoria:**
That much hasn't changed. Half the village still doesn't even believe in that.
 
**Artoria:**
Even so, sending me off is what everyone wishes for, for better or worse.
 
**Artoria:**
What about you, old man? Do you really think I'm the Child of Prophecy?
 
**Ector:**
I don't care. Tintagel's situation is none of my business.
 
**Ector:**
More importantly, go gather some sand from the beach. Tomorrow we're making more jewelry.
 
**Ector:**
There's a festival in Ketsee Forest coming up soon. Doesn't matter if it's all cheap stuff, they put in a large order.
 
**Narration:**
Ector's skill let him work not only arms or household items, but jewelry as well.
 
**Narration:**
A variety of jeweller's tools were always lined up on the workshop desks.
 
**Narration:**
Ector dismissed them as flimsy playthings, but I, with my one set of clothes, had no eyes for appraising their value.
 
**Narration:**
Red, blue, green. Sometimes yellow. Like stars shining in the night sky.
 
**Narration:**
Without realizing it, I had stopped working and had started staring at the jewelled hair ornaments on top of the desk.
 
**Narration:**
In autumn of my second year there, Ector couldn't stay quiet seeing me like this anymore.
 
**Ector:**
If you like, you can take one as a pattern to work off of. Parting with just one is well within my margin of error.
 
**Narration:**
Errors. The flawed products of work that turn out broken.
 
**Narration:**
Ector didn't make failures, but he pushed me onward with those words.
 
**Narration:**
But, that said...
 
**Artoria:**
I don't want one. If I get something of my own, it'll just be taken away again.
 
**Narration:**
I was so happy and wanted it so badly that my vision blurred over.
 
**Narration:**
Something as important as the Staff of Selection can't be taken.
 
**Narration:**
But, for the first time in a while, I remembered a conversation I had as a child.
 
**Narration:**
It was a conversation with Merlin, who was responding to my unreasonable requests, increasing by the day.
 
**Merlin:**
Abominable things that need to disappear! The narrow-mindedness of the fairies that own you!
 
**Merlin:**
No, no, no, no, no! Everybody in Britain right now is disgusting!
 
**Merlin:**
&mdash;Just joking. But if you think like that, Artoria, then you should say so.
 
**Merlin:**
It's okay to want what you want. Don't hold back.
 
**Merlin:**
Now, don't be shy and tell me what would be the best thing for you right now.
 
**Artoria:**
I want magecraft that blows my enemies to smithereens. Something like that.
 
**Merlin:**
Mm-hm. A tool that stockpiles magical energy, and magecraft that equals gunpowder in explosive power?
 
**Merlin:**
Wouldn't that be a fine act of terrorism...
 
**Merlin:**
Well, you never know when you might be attacked by a Black Dog.
 
**Merlin:**
Sure, I'll whip up a recipe. Can you give me three—no, maybe six days?
 
**Merlin:**
Uh...I'm sure in Norwich... there's a smith who knows about this stuff...
 
**Artoria:**
You're awfully kind and caring, Merlin. Are you popular with the ladies?
 
**Merlin:**
Well, I don't know about that. I'm a bit lost when people like you talk about stuff like love.
 
**Merlin:**
It's like a meal. I just visualize what it tastes like instead of who I'm eating it with.
 
**Merlin:**
Because I'm like that, I'm not the type loved by humans or fairies.
 
**Merlin:**
I suddenly found myself in that role though, and when I tried my hand at it, it turns out I'm better at this stuff than anybody else.
 
**Merlin:**
To be honest, I'm the one most confused about that myself.
 
**Artoria:**
Don't you have someone you love? Even just one person? Despite being the magus of flowers?
 
**Artoria:**
Aren't you lonely?
 
**Merlin:**
Hmm. You might be right. It's a degree of sentimentality I'd only notice when you mention it.
 
**Merlin:**
I knew from the start that was something I could never have, so I never worried about it.
 
**Merlin:**
But&mdash;I suppose that's true.
 
**Merlin:**
Studying magecraft, searching for a way to save Britain, looking for a significant other...it's all the same to me.
 
**Artoria:**
Um...what do you mean?
 
**Merlin:**
Well, it's lonely looking for a star that probably doesn't exist, but it's still fun all the same.
 
**Narration:**
And so came the morning of my sixteenth birthday. Everybody in the village gathered in the square and chanted:
 
**Fairies:**
Show us proof. Show us proof.
 
**Fairies:**
Show us proof that you are the Child of Prophecy. The blacksmith living on that hill is one of the Queen's elite guard.
 
**Fairies:**
You're the only one that blacksmith isn't wary of. The only one he opens up to.
 
**Fairies:**
If you are the fairy that will save Britain, then go kill that blacksmith.
 
**Fairies:**
Please. Please. Every day is nerve-wracking.
 
**Fairies:**
That's why&mdash;you must protect us by taking care of him...!
 
**Narration:**
That concludes my autumn memories.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Narration:**
The Earth Clan fairy that had settled down on the cape used to be one of Queen Morgan's elite guard.
 
**Narration:**
The fears of the village fairies were justified.
 
**Narration:**
They believed that if Ector was killed, the village's safety would be secured.
 
**Narration:**
Everyone was urgently saying:
 
**Fairies:**
Go kill him. Go kill him.
 
**Fairies:**
If you're the Child of Prophecy, go kill the minion of the Queen!
 
**Narration:**
Their wishes suffocated me, and as usual I was too exhausted to refuse them, so...
 
**Artoria:**
Yes...
 
**Artoria:**
All right...after all, I'm the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Narration:**
I did what was wanted of me, what was expected of me. I decided to kill my friend.
 
**Narration:**
It's just like I said. I could never keep anything I treasured.
 
**Artoria:**
I have to kill him...I have to kill him...
 
**Artoria:**
I have to kill him...I have to kill him...
 
**Artoria:**
If I don't, they'll kill me. They'll kill me for being a fake.
 
**Narration:**
Ector was hard of hearing, so sneaking in was simple. He was completely defenseless, asleep on his stone bed.
 
**Narration:**
In my hand I carried a rusted-over knife that was given to me by the villagers.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;, &mdash;
 
**Narration:**
It would be a lie to say refusing was too much of a pain. I was simply afraid.
 
**Narration:**
Afraid of being labelled a fake. Of being beaten for being useless.
 
**Narration:**
Afraid that everything I had done so far would end up meaningless.
 
**Narration:**
That's why...that's why...
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash; Gh&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
I was so pissed I swung the knife down as hard as I could.
 
**Artoria:**
Ahhh...well, I guess I can manage somehow...
 
**Narration:**
I walked down the darkened street, putting away the chipped blade.
 
**Narration:**
I was merely anxious, but the fairies of the village were naïve.
 
**Narration:**
I returned, optimistic that I would be able to muddle through if I explained it well, but...
 
**Friend:**
Don't listen to her! She didn't kill the blacksmith!
 
**Friend:**
I saw it all! She only hit a helmet with the knife, the smith wasn't there!
 
**Friend:**
What's more, the magecraft she's using is just gunpowder!
 
**Friend:**
She's not the Child of Prophecy! She's no special fairy! She's just a liar!
 
**Fairies Gathered in the Square:**
What the&mdash; What the&mdash;
 
**Fairies Gathered in the Square:**
You couldn't kill the elite guard...you couldn't kill Morgan's minion...
 
**Fairies Gathered in the Square:**
Then you can't be the Child of Prophecy...we knew there was something wrong about you!
 
**Narration:**
Despite my attempt at running away from the town square, the village fairies were far stronger than me both physically and magically.
 
**Fairies:**
Get Caster! Get the liar!
 
**Fairies:**
For passing yourself off as the Child of Prophecy, you'll be given to Woodwose's execution squad!
 
**Narration:**
I was soon caught and put in a jail cell built underneath the village.
 
**Narration:**
My friend, who had accused me, was so proud of it too. I understood that as well.
 
**Narration:**
She always addressed me as “friend” in the village, but was always envious and suspicious of me.
 
**Narration:**
It's not like she was a bad person.
 
**Narration:**
But still, she was just another person, less fortunate though she might have been...
 
**Narration:**
I became “nothing special,” so no more good feelings were had towards me.
 
**Narration:**
After that, the village got more and more hectic.
 
**Narration:**
Woodwose's execution squad.
 
**Narration:**
A terrifying unit dedicated to capturing the Child of Prophecy and bringing them to the castle.
 
**Narration:**
They would arrive in Tintagel in three days. Until then, I passed the time in my jail cell.
 
**Queen-supporting Fairy:**
You've finally shown your true colors. I'll be relieved to present you to Her Majesty.
 
**Queen-supporting Fairy:**
I never believed in you from the start. There's no way a fairy like you could have saved the world.
 
**Child of Prophecy-supporting Fairy:**
I don't want to do something horrible like turning you over to Woodwose, but...
 
**Child of Prophecy-supporting Fairy:**
Everyone thinks that since you're a fake, we have no choice...but, no...is that what we're fixated on...?
 
**Village Leader:**
How could this happen...so close...we were so close...
 
**Village Leader:**
No, it was impossible from the beginning...
 
**Village Leader:**
The year you drifted in, this village was supposed to disappear...
 
**Village Leader:**
And you...you gave us hope...and a boatload of treasure...but now that's all spent...
 
**Village Leader:**
Now the village will...no, if we can pass you off as the real thing, we could maybe get a bounty for you...
 
**Mother:**
I'm sorry, Caster...I did my best...to convince everyone, but...
 
**Mother:**
I'm sad things turned out this way, too...and you worked so hard...
 
**Narration:**
A lot of fairies came to see me in my jail cell. Fairies of all manner of standing and circumstances.
 
**Narration:**
The fairies of Tintagel were divided among supporters of the Queen and the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Narration:**
Based on what had happened to me, the Queen's faction seemed to have gained the upper hand over the Child of Prophecy's faction.
 
**Narration:**
There was not a single fairy who could help me.
 
**Narration:**
But there were fairies who wanted to let me go, so I had to concede that it wasn't all lost.
 
**Narration:**
Whether I was to win or lose, it would happen three days later.
 
**Narration:**
Just before being taken out of the jail cell and presented to the execution squad, I would have one last chance to make my escape.
 
**Narration:**
I kept track of my physical condition so that I could run at any time. I remained vigilant.
 
**Artoria:**
It's only natural, of course... I've been training myself for the Pilgrimage, after all.
 
**Artoria:**
Having it end before I even set out is too much to ask for.
 
**Narration:**
When I heard a clamor from outside I braced myself, thinking the execution squad had arrived.
 
**Ector:**
Hmph, you're still alive. I guess the villagers weren't that stupid after all.
 
**Artoria:**
Ector!? You're wounded!
 
**Ector:**
This is nothing. I just beat up some nobodies. Spare me the talking and let's get out of here.
 
**Ector:**
Put this on. Better you wear a hat instead of a helmet, it'll hide your face a little better.
 
**Artoria:**
You came to help me escape!?
 
**Artoria:**
Ah, this hat is so cool and cute! You've got great taste, Ector!
 
**Ector:**
Don't flatter me. And take this too. It was yours to begin with. I'm just returning it.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
It was the Staff of Selection that had been taken from me when I was a child.
 
**Narration:**
Though it had been nine years, it remained as familiar to me as my own body.
 
**Narration:**
But then...Merlin's frivolous voice seemed to be long gone.
 
**Ector:**
Now get out of here, there's no time. Woodwose's execution squad is nearly&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Ector!?
 
**Ector:**
Don't say that name...For you, it's ominous. It will bring you bad luck.
 
**Ector:**
I've taken out the guards, but replacements will be here soon. You have until daybreak.
 
**Ector:**
Run as far as you can. If you can make it to Salisbury's plains...
 
**Ector:**
What the hell? What's going outside&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
The execution squad had arrived, and were setting the village ablaze.
 
**Narration:**
At the time, that was the only sensical scenario that came to my mind.
 
**Ector:**
How...they said they were going to cut down on the number of mouths to feed this winter, but...
 
**Ector:**
To go so far as to start killing each other...this is beyond stupid, it's just pathetic...
 
**Woodwose:**
What the hell is going on!? I get a tip to come out here, and the villagers are all killing each other!?
 
**Woodwose:**
Who is in charge here!? Where's the Child of Prophecy!? Bring them here!
 
**Woodwose's Soldier:**
Lord Woodwose, please stay back! You're losing your composure!
 
**Woodwose's Soldier:**
You can't carry out an interrogation this way! Please, stay rational!
 
**Woodwose:**
Tch...alright, listen up! Polemen, exterminate the village inhabitants! Spearmen, barricade all the exits to the village!
 
**Woodwose:**
With things this bad, our hands are tied! Don't let even one of them escape! Put the fire out only after the riot has been quelled!
 
**Woodwose:**
The fairy thought to be the Child of Prophecy must be captured alive! This is Her Majesty's command!
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Everyone!
 
**Narration:**
I wasn't thinking anything in particular. No, it was more like there was no room to think.
 
**Narration:**
I ran towards the village square to help everyone, but...
 
**Ector:**
Don't go! You'll never make it! Leave the village, Artoria!
 
**Ector:**
Why bother helping those villagers!? Aren't they the ones who sold you out!?
 
**Artoria:**
That's true, but&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
We had all lived together.
 
**Narration:**
They may have been full of lies for 16 years, but that didn't mean it was okay to abandon them.
 
**Ector:**
Fool...
 
**Ector:**
Just come on! They're here for the Child of Prophecy!
 
**Ector:**
If you get outside the village, you'll be safe from the executioners!
 
**Ector:**
Run to a nearby forest! After that, do whatever you want!
 
**Narration:**
The old man pulling on my hand started to run.
 
**Ector:**
&mdash;Hmph. Right, from here on you're on your own.
 
**Ector:**
I ran into one of Woodwose's soldiers on the way. They're after you. You need to leave now.
 
**Artoria:**
What about you...? Are you coming...or not?
 
**Ector:**
No. I still have work to do.
 
**Ector:**
As soon as I see you off, I'm going back to my forge on the cape. This is goodbye.
 
**Ector:**
You're a nuisance, little girl. Don't show your face at my place ever again.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;B-but...Ector&mdash;Ector...!
 
**Narration:**
It was a white lie. I could see that.
 
**Narration:**
The sharp wound in his side he hid under his clothes. The many stab wounds all over his back...
 
**Narration:**
...and his weakening heartbeat that would stop as soon as I took my eyes off him. I saw them all.
 
**Ector:**
I knew it...Fairies of Paradise are such a pain.
 
**Ector:**
The village is done for...the executioners are already here.
 
**Ector:**
Lift your head. Grasp your staff. It's time for you to set out, Artoria.
 
**Ector:**
No matter what anybody says, or even if you doubt it yourself, you are definitely the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Ector:**
You didn't kill me that night, did you? That's your true character, who you really are.
 
**Ector:**
No matter how much Britain rejects you, no matter how hard the fairies shun you.
 
**Ector:**
No matter how much weaker you are than the other fairies. You're more of a savior than anybody else.
 
**Ector:**
It looks like you haven't noticed it. You're fundamentally incapable of getting mad for your own sake.
 
**Ector:**
And&mdash;
 
**Ector:**
You're just like her, kiddo.
 
**Ector:**
You're stubborn and hate to lose, and always get back up no matter how many times you fall. You'll definitely accomplish what you set out to do.
 
**Artoria:**
No...I'll go back to the forge and live on the cape! That way, things will be better!
 
**Artoria:**
Then when I turn 17 and the prophecy turns out to be a lie, I won't bother you&mdash;
 
**Ector:**
&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
But that was an impossible dream, and my words never reached him.
 
**Narration:**
I never knew what kind of person he was. I didn't understand why he went so far to help me.
 
**Narration:**
At the time, the only thing I could understand was the sound of my heart within my chest. That was the only thing left alive.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Yeah. That's right.
 
**Artoria:**
My specialty is getting back on my feet, no matter how many times I get discouraged or depressed.
 
**Narration:**
I held on tight to the Staff of Selection, and firmly put my new hat on my head.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Goodbye, everybody. Thank you for raising me until I turned 16.
 
**Artoria:**
I am a Fairy of Paradise. The one who will deliver salvation to Britain.
 
**Artoria:**
As you all wished, I will start the Pilgrimage.
 
**Narration:**
Or so I said, but my Pilgrimage was never even acknowledged.
 
**Narration:**
I attempted to meet with the Wind Clan head in Salisbury, but was turned away at the door by the rebel army.
 
**Narration:**
Despite the fact that I performed several tasks and was asked to show proof I was the Child of Prophecy...
 
**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
What forest did you come from, fairy? You've got shabby clothes and the bare minimum of magical energy.
 
**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Well, I guess you took care of the job in your own way. Good work killing the Mors on the highway!
 
**Soldiers of Salisbury, A:**
Good luck with saving Britain! I don't know how many centuries it'll take though!
 
**Soldiers of Salisbury, B:**
We don't need the Child of Prophecy anyway, little girl. We have Lady Aurora.
 
**Soldiers of Salisbury, B:**
The fairies are welcoming the Child of Prophecy? Ah, that's just for show.
 
**Soldiers of Salisbury, B:**
Fairies jump whenever there's fun to be had. They'll go for anything that's popular.
 
**Soldiers of Salisbury, B:**
Nobody actually believes in the Child of Prophecy. They don't wish for one.
 
**Soldiers of Salisbury, B:**
We're fine with the system the way it is. If only Morgan would just go away.
 
**Narration:**
With the laughter of the crowd seeing me off, I bitterly wandered west and east.
 
**Narration:**
I scratched my cheeks and visited many forests, convincing myself that it was yet too early for me to try the big cities.
 
**Narration:**
The results were the same. I was used, laughed at, and shooed away as a nuisance.
 
**Narration:**
Outwardly, they were all for the Child of Prophecy, but their hearts were more honest.
 
**Narration:**
“Isn't there anything more fun?”
 
**Artoria:**
I see...They love the rumors about the Child of Prophecy, but the real thing is just a hindrance, huh...
 
**Narration:**
I had no fairies to ask for instruction, and no friends to share in my suffering.
 
**Narration:**
All the fairies in Britain hated me the instant they saw me.
 
**Narration:**
The humans hated fairies, too. At that rate, I would have to simply continue my journey alone.
 
**Artoria:**
It's too painful...
 
**Artoria:**
It's painful...
 
**Narration:**
Feeling weak, I went into the Nameless Forest.
 
**Narration:**
I didn't have any particular thoughts about it, just for a little while...
 
**Narration:**
I just wanted to be myself, and nobody else.
 
**Narration:**
But the curse of forgetfulness doesn't work on Fairies of Paradise, so fortunately, it was a letdown.
 
**Narration:**
I pretended to have lost my memories and withdrew into the tent for newcomers, feeling empty inside.
 
**Narration:**
Then, a new fairy was brought over.
 
**Fujimaru:**
&mdash;Mash?
 
**Narration:**
{(M)He/(F)She} had lost {(M)his/(F)her} memories. Both {(M)his/(F)her} body and mind were in shambles, and {(M)he/(F)she} couldn't be left alone.
 
**Narration:**
And most importantly&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
If {(M)he/(F)she} had forgotten all about the Child of Prophecy, I thought that perhaps we could be friends.
 
**Narration:**
There lay my summer memories.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Artoria:**
It's finally time for the spring memories!
 
**Artoria:**
If it's spring, they must all be happy ones!
 
**Artoria:**
The obstacles that appear will probably be easy ones too. Feel free to beat them up.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If we can, I'd rather not fight Mors, but...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes...if that thing is the embodiment of Artoria's memories, then...
 
**Mash:**
They must be extremely painful memories...
 
**Mash:**
Just facing the Mors causes us heartache...
 
**Merlin:**
To be fair, that's only up to summer.
 
**Merlin:**
“Spring memories” are made up of only things that person considers enjoyable.
 
**Merlin:**
The obstacle that appears here, well...
 
**Merlin:**
There's no mistake, she either dressed herself up or is treating us to something pretty huge here.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well...that's okay. Before this turns into a fight, I want to make one thing clear.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You said that when all the Pilgrim's Bells have been rung, the Fairy of Paradise will become the Holy Sword itself, right?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So, essentially that means&mdash;if the Holy Sword is created, Artoria herself will vanish, right?
 
**Merlin:**
You got it. She'll disappear in exchange for the establishment of the concept of the Holy Sword.
 
**Merlin:**
That's not only the mission of the Fairy of Paradise, it's their purpose. Forging the Holy Sword is no simple task.
 
**Merlin:**
Her accumulated memories, experiences, her Saint Graph, even her destiny. All of these will be used as “materials” to forge the Holy Sword.
 
**Merlin:**
Don't think of it as a sacrifice. It's equivalent exchange to the bitter end.
 
**Merlin:**
Not just anybody will work. If it's not her, then it's impossible.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Does Artoria know this?
 
**Merlin:**
She does. Once her mission is accomplished, her life is forfeit.
 
**Merlin:**
She should have known that much from the start.
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
I can understand how you all must feel. But I want you to understand there are no other options.
 
**Merlin:**
She descended into the Spirit Cave knowing this.
 
**Merlin:**
It may be partly forced upon her, but she proceeded to the Site of Selection of her own free will.
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Artoria:**
Eh? Huh? What is it, everybody?
 
**Mash:**
Artoria?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Wait, isn't it too early? The setup is all different.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
After all, we haven't fought...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**

 

---

 
**Artoria:**
I see...
 
**Artoria:**
This time was too easy! I was finished before I realized it too!
 
**Artoria:**
The Site of Selection is up on that hill, isn't it? All right, let's have a race to see who gets there first!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How can she be so carefree...!?|
 

---

 
**Senji Muramasa:**
You said it...she's taking this way too lightly.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Fujimaru, I'm relieved you're so upset about this.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But just leave what happens after this to your elders.
 
**Mash:**
Muramasa? What are you...
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Don't worry, just run after her. At this rate she really is going to get ahead of us.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No matter what, this is the ending of a long journey for her. Let's be sure to watch her see it through.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
When I closed my eyes, I saw it. When I slept, I saw it.
 
**Narration:**
But none of that is true. It's a lie. Whether I close my eyes or fell asleep doesn't matter.
 
**Narration:**
To me, this was simply what the human world had always looked like.
 
**Narration:**
The wind and dark clouds were no storm. They were the voices of people.
 
**Caster:**
Aaaa&mdash;aaaaaaa&mdash;aaaaaaaaa&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
I crushed my eyes because it was too ugly. I crushed my ears because it was too repulsive.
 
**Narration:**
And yet the darkness wouldn't lift. The wind wouldn't stop.
 
**Narration:**
In this world suffused with corruption, I had to fulfill my mission as a Fairy of Paradise.
 
**Caster:**
I can't...! I can't...! I just can't do this...!
 
**Narration:**
No matter how much I cried out, there was nobody to hear me. I couldn't even hear my own voice, as the wind drowned it out.
 
**Narration:**
After learning many things in the village and getting to know the hearts of the fairies, the storm became much, much stronger.
 
**Narration:**
I didn't know where to go or what I should be doing.
 
**Narration:**
I thought Queen Morgan was rather lucky.
 
**Narration:**
“I will make Britain a country of my own.”
 
**Narration:**
With such (enviable!) conviction, there was no way she would get lost in this storm.
 
**Caster:**
I can't. I don't have that. I can't measure up to her.
 
**Narration:**
I hated Britain. I hated fairies. I hated humans.
 
**Narration:**
There was no way I could find my way like that.
 
**Narration:**
No...I could see it. It was shown to me when I rang the Pilgrim's Bell.
 
**Narration:**
The King of Britain—Artoria Pendragon.
 
**Narration:**
When I learned that this was the state of myself in pan-human history, I felt nauseous from the bottom of my heart.
 
**Narration:**
An ideal knight, a life led for others. A king who gave their all for the future of Britain.
 
**Narration:**
I wouldn't want to turn out that way. I don't think I'd want to live a life like that.
 
**Narration:**
But the forging of the Holy Sword sealed her fate.
 
**Narration:**
If only there wasn't a Holy Sword, her life would have turned out very differently.
 
**Narration:**
If it weren't for the Holy Sword, Britain would have met a very different end.
 
**Caster:**
I'll quit...I'll just quit. Yeah, that's fine.
 
**Caster:**
After all, I'm the only one who can save that girl.
 
**Narration:**
Every time I heard the bells toll, I thought that over and over again.
 
**Narration:**
But...
 
**Caster:**
&mdash;That star is still watching.
 
**Narration:**
I didn't know what that star was.
 
**Narration:**
It wasn't my aspirations, my purpose, or something important to me.
 
**Narration:**
But it was always there. Ever since I was born.
 
**Narration:**
The star that was always there, no matter how small or frail it was in the midst of this raging storm.
 
**Caster:**
&mdash;I don't know where I want to go.
 
**Caster:**
I don't care about the mission. I don't want to be the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Caster:**
And yet, why&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
I didn't stop moving forward.
 
**Narration:**
I didn't want to just give up and lose to this storm.
 
**Caster:**
I don't get it...why am I so stubborn...
 
**Caster:**
What am I throwing away my life for...?
 
**Narration:**
There is no spring for Fairies of Paradise like myself. There's nothing to be gained.
 
**Narration:**
That's why I at least want to know the reason I couldn't give up until the end.
 
**Narration:**
The reason why someone like me, neither a queen nor a savior, was able to make it this far.
 
**Narration:**
What was that tiny star to such an ordinary person like myself&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
This is...the Site of Selection...where the Holy Sword is forged, right?
 
**Merlin:**
That's right. In the center there is the Sky Furnace. The place where the Fairies of Paradise must return to.
 
**Merlin:**
Once you offer your body to it, the Holy Sword will be established.
 
**Merlin:**
And it won't be for just this Lostbelt. The concept of the Holy Sword will finally be returned to you guys on the bleached Earth.
 
**Merlin:**
It won't be a temporary recreation like a Heroic Spirit recorded in the Lostbelt,
 
**Merlin:**
but the weapon meant to defeat alien invaders, once belonging to the humanity of this age.
 
**Artoria:**
So...Fujimaru and Mash's world can be saved, right?
 
**Merlin:**
Yes. The chance of it being saved will go from zero to one.
 
**Artoria:**
I see! Then we really have to do it!
 
**Artoria:**
Britain will return to how it should be, and the outside world will be saved! We're killing two birds with one stone!
 
**Mash:**
But...that's...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
What's wrong, you two? You look sick to your stomachs.
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, if you want, why don't you rest outside? This won't take long.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not it.|

---

 
**Merlin:**
You got it. She'll disappear in exchange for the establishment of the concept of the Holy Sword.
 
？1,1080,saveMaterial：Stop this. This is bullshit.
 
**Artoria:**
But you're the one who told me to not run away. You told me that.
 
？2,2080,saveMaterial：&mdash;
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Well then.
 
**Artoria:**
Ah. Since this is the end, I have a confession to make.
 
**Artoria:**
Fairies, humans, Britain, and my mission, I hated them all.
 
**Artoria:**
Fighting is scary. Hating everything equally is exhausting. I'd have been happy to live a normal life.
 
**Artoria:**
People would be disappointed if I said any of that, so I had no choice to but act as the Child of Prophecy.
 
**Artoria:**
So my journey with everyone has always felt like walking on thin ice.
 
**Artoria:**
I somehow persevered this time, but come a second time, I'm sure I would abandon it.
 
**Artoria:**
To think I'd be able to make it this far, I'm the most shocked of all.
 
**Artoria:**
To forge the Holy Sword also means erasing the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Artoria:**
I never grew any fonder of fairies or humans, but I could see their underlying “wishes”.
 
**Artoria:**
Every single one of them suffered on the inside. They all yearned for salvation.
 
**Artoria:**
I don't think anyone deserves that much, even if sinners should be punished for their crimes.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;After all, we're all the same!
 
**Artoria:**
If you're alive, then there are both fake and real lies!
 
**Artoria:**
And the voice under them all is that everyone wanted to be saved!
 
**Artoria:**
Seriously...I wish they'd stop doing that.
 
**Artoria:**
Even the road to Avalon was rough. I mean, I felt like “what the heck!?”
 
**Artoria:**
But I'm glad I was able to look back on it. My life didn't turn out all that badly.
 
**Artoria:**
Until now, I've been thinking there's no way I could save this world.
 
**Artoria:**
That there's no way I could bring their world to an end.
 
**Artoria:**
Because, well, the fate of the world isn't something you should shoulder if you don't even like it, right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Yeah...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But you'll still do it, right?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Yeah. I will.
 
**Artoria:**
I'm here to fulfill my mission. And the funny thing is I don't even understand why myself!
 
**Artoria:**
It's probably some self-righteous reason, you know. Something of no worth to anybody else.
 
**Artoria:**
Just like Fujimaru showed in the depths of {(M)his/(F)her} Dejection.
 
**Artoria:**
Just like when Mash confronted the Calamity in Norwich.
 
**Artoria:**
Not for someone else, not for you, not for what's right.
 
**Artoria:**
I think it's just for me.
 
**Artoria:**
For at least one thing that could never be betrayed. The thing in the midst of that raging storm I could never go back on.
 
**Narration:**
I dissolve away from my fingertips. My silhouette is disappearing.
 
**Narration:**
After this, I'll lose my memories, and in the end I'll lose my sense of self.
 
**Narration:**
The Inner Sea isn't taking my memories by choice.
 
**Narration:**
It's taking them because it's necessary to use the state of humanity of this era as materials to forge the Holy Sword.
 
**Narration:**
I was just the vessel to accumulate them. To forge a stronger, better Holy Sword.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;I'm glad. This will definitely be an excellent blade.
 
**Narration:**
Like the beacon in that tempest. A shining star that won't be defeated by any evil on Earth.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;A there that is not here. &mdash;A you who is not me.
 
**Narration:**
A sword that is worthy of you, the granter of many wishes, the recipient of many smiling faces, and the one who raised their head in the Site of Selection.
 
**Narration:**
Aah, I'm glad...Caster has no spring memories.
 
**Narration:**
But for me, it is the memory of a wonderful journey.
 
**Narration:**
I don't have a form of my own anymore. By forging the Holy Sword, the mission of the Fairy of Paradise comes to an end.
 
**Narration:**
Caster's—the one who chants'—journey ends here.
 
**Narration:**
And that's fine. I haven't come this far because I didn't want to die.
 
**Narration:**
But&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
I just wanted to know.
 
**Narration:**
That light that I saw. That light that saw me.
 
**Narration:**
I've been trying to understand that, and I knew I wouldn't be complete until I did.
 
**Narration:**
I thought I'd understand on my journey, but in the end I never found my answer.
 
**Narration:**
It's just...a little...disappointing&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I see. Then you're not done here.
 
**Narration:**
 
Huh? &mdash;Why?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
No special reason. I'm a swordsmith.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Who the heck do you take me for? I cut rules, I cut karma, I dedicated my life to the sword. I'm Senji Muramasa.
 
**Narration:**
 
&mdash;
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Come on, get outta here. You've gathered the raw materials. Now it's the smith's job.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
So, this is the Sky Furnace in the Inner Sea of the Planet, huh? Gets me fired up just getting close to it!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
This is going to be quite a job. My thanks, Artoria.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Being your bodyguard wasn't a bad gig, but you know, a tiger can't change its stripes.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
This is more suited for me.
 
**Narration:**
 
No! I mean, I'm happy, but no...! It'll turn you to ash, Muramasa...!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, bring it on!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Striking the metal is the one real desire of a smith, and if it's at a divine forge then it's worth burning my life up!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Of course this thing is burning me up! Even if my Saint Graph goes up in flames, it won't stop me from striking!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's looking good. The mold is ready, so let's make good use of it!
 
**Narration:**
 
I told you it's&mdash;wait, why am I floating!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Oh, I took over the job for you. You're in the way now, so you're being kicked out.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
See you, Child of Prophecy.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Who says you have to give it all up? Especially if you still have unfinished business.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
It's just a little power, enough to finish the job, but you can keep it for yourself.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
But this is the end of my job with those guys. They bought my life, so isn't it only natural I pay them back with it?
 
**Narration:**
 
That bill was settled a long time ago!
 
**Narration:**
 
You're from the outside world, Muramasa! You're Fujimaru's enemy!
 
**Narration:**
 
You have nothing to do with Britain! Isn't your real job supposed to come after this!?
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Yeah, this way I don't have to face the Alien God! I'll probably never see it again!
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
Well, it's not your problem. I like it as much as you do, kid.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
This was how it was going to go from the beginning. But what the hell.
 
**Senji Muramasa:**
I really wish I could have made myself that hairpiece, though.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The light...disappeared...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Artoria...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
One Saint Graph response...has vanished...
 
**Merlin:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Artoria...even though it was so we could forge the Holy Sword...
 
**Artoria:**
That's right. I think there's a problem with the forging process.
 
**Artoria:**
I don't know if the human spirit isn't there, or if it's just not efficient enough.
 
**Artoria:**
Still, the Inner Sea is where the planet's soul is kept. It didn't have a human soul to start with.
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Fujimaru, Mash.
 
**Artoria:**
This is the “base model of the Holy Sword”—its “essence”. Please deliver it while you have the time.
 
**Artoria:**
Da Vinci and the rest of Chaldea should be able to refine the formula using this as a base.
 
**Artoria:**
I wish you could have gotten Excalibur, but... it seems like that didn't work out so well.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's just like a Holy Grail...!?|
 
**Mash:**
Yes, it's a fundamental truth of magecraft of the same quality, no, of the same rank! But that's not the problem here, Senpai!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait, what the heck is this!?
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Why did she come back? I wasn't expecting this either.
 
**Merlin:**
I thought for sure there'd be a Chaldea-brand Excalibur&mdash;
 
**Merlin:**
No, wait. I don't know when it happened, but he's not here anymore.
 
**Merlin:**
I see...so there was someone to give you a slight reprieve.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Muramasa.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The old man is gone...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes...just a moment ago, a single Saint Graph definitely vanished...
 
**Mash:**
That...was due to Muramasa's actions, wasn't it...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He protected her...to the very end...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just like him to finish the job...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yes. The Heroic Spirit Senji Muramasa died according to his beliefs.
 
**Artoria:**
The reason I'm here is because he was the one who put the finishing touches on it.
 
**Artoria:**
The Holy Sword was delivered to the Inner Sea of the Planet, and the basis of this Lostbelt was overturned.
 
**Artoria:**
It'll be pruned back to nonexistence before too long, probably.
 
**Artoria:**
But there are things that need to be done first.
 
**Artoria:**
The Fairy Kingdom of Britain, the Lostworld created by the traitor Morgan.
 
**Artoria:**
The Calamity created in that place cannot be allowed to become a pruning phenomenon.
 
**Artoria:**
This is a threat to humanity that you will all have to overturn with your own hands.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The air about her is different, but...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm glad you're safe. Welcome back, Artoria.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yeah, I'm back!
 
**Artoria:**
Artoria Caster, keeper of the Holy Sword, is back stronger than ever!
 
**Merlin:**
Yeah, she's powered up no matter how you look at it. And that magecraft theory...!
 
**Merlin:**
Rather than Hero Creation, it's like Holy Sword Creation!?
 
**Merlin:**
Hey, no fair stealing my skills! Are you trying to upstage me!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Same as ever, Merlin.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't listen to him, Artoria.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
It's a shame that Fou isn't here.
 
**Merlin:**
Well, can't be helped. We have different roles to play. I'll call it a good thing and suck it up.
 
**Merlin:**
&mdash;He protected her, and she endured. This is definitely some kind of cause-and-effect.
 
**Merlin:**
Here, the Holy Sword was created, and a star was born.
 
**Merlin:**
The Child of Prophecy carried out her mission, and the foreign magus assisted her.
 
**Merlin:**
Now it's my turn. Things may have passed the point of no return up there, but I can fix it a little.
 
**Merlin:**
To be more specific, I mean Cernunnos. I'll rewind time just a little bit.
 
**Mash:**
Rewind...? To before Cernunnos appeared?
 
**Merlin:**
Yeah. With Cernunnos out and about and the curses overflowing, you'll have no chance even with the Holy Sword's protection.
 
**Merlin:**
That's why I'll go back...yeah, about two hours.
 
**Merlin:**
I thought this might happen, so I've been looking into the dreams of the “Great Pit.”
 
**Merlin:**
We'll just pretend that the Cernunnos from before was a dream he was having, and wake him up from that.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You can do something like that...!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's right, you did something like this in Uruk...
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Yeah. I was free of the Garden, so it was really boring just waiting here.
 
**Merlin:**
I spent my time casting spells on the Great Pit. Thanks to that, my Saint Graph is all worn out.
 
**Merlin:**
Once this dream realm is lifted, this me will vanish.
 
**Merlin:**
I'm sorry to say I won't be able to bear witness to your battle.
 
**Merlin:**
Oh? As you might expect, I wasn't going to just leave everything up to her.
 
**Merlin:**
I didn't quite expect this result, though. But that's the margin of error for you.
 
**Merlin:**
As a special bonus at the end, I'll drop you off at the Storm Border instead of having to go through the Spirit Cave!
 
**Merlin:**
You have one hour until Cernunnos appears. And one hour until the curses overflow.
 
**Merlin:**
That's your time limit for this battle. This time you have to win.
 
**Merlin:**
Muramasa and I have done all we can here. All that's left is for you to all do your best.
 
**Merlin:**
Isn't that right, king without a name? Can I ask you to take care of Fujimaru and Mash for me?
 
**Artoria:**
Of course. You be well too, True Magus of Flowers.
 
**Artoria:**
Well...this is just a shadow of Avalon, after all. You're probably still imprisoned in your tower even now.
 
**Merlin:**
You can tell that much, huh? It seems like you've become the true guardian of the Holy Sword.
 
**Merlin:**
Well then, return to the ruined Britain!
 
**Merlin:**
To greet the clear blue sky beyond the twilight!
 
**Merlin:**
Okay, I've safely sent them back. I've just about reached my limits, good thing they made it in time.
 
**Merlin:**
Oh, I forgot to ask them one thing though.
 
**Merlin:**
I was using Clairvoyance to watch Chaldea's journey as close as possible...
 
**Merlin:**
Fujimaru was talking to {(M)him/(F)her}self an awful lot this time.
 
**Merlin:**
Hmm. What was that all about?
 
## Intermission 
 

 ~The skies over Britain~ 
 ~Two hours since the demon dog's appearance~
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That enormous Demonic Beast...I see, the Lord of the Black Dogs...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The glutton of magical energy, feasting on black smoke and lightning. So you've finally become a Calamity, Barghest...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Cernunnos' curses won't stop pouring out of the Great Pit...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
There's nowhere left to run. You can join the Unseelie Court, or you can become one of the Mors...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Either way, decent fairies are becoming scarce. I don't know how long I will be able to retain my sanity, either.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Even if this is the Great Calamity...this is all...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
All her fault...Aurora...my love. My raison d'être. My&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
Listen to me, Lancelot. Ainsel is a very, very dangerous fairy.
 
**Aurora:**
Muttering these absurd prophecies. No one is even aware of their true nature.
 
**Aurora:**
Who knows what she'll do once she becomes popular by drawing everyone's attention like that&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
The Mirror Clan, just like the Rain Clan, is a clan that sheltered the Fairy of Paradise, no?
 
**Aurora:**
To think they'd make such a prophecy now, when we don't even know when the Great Calamity is liable to occur&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
It's nothing short of treason against Queen Morgan. Just the thought of it clouds my wings.
 
**Aurora:**
■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■, you understand how I feel, don't you?
 
**Aurora:**
After all, you are my prince.
 
**Aurora:**
You always bring me what I desire the most, don't you?
 
**Narration:**
She possesses no malicious intent. In the first place, for her, there exists no such thing as good or evil.
 
**Narration:**
“The most compassionate and benevolent fairy who dreams of a world where fairies and humans may coexist.”
 
**Narration:**
But that's not exactly the case. It only appears to be.
 
**Narration:**
The only one she loves is herself.
 
**Narration:**
She treasures a world where she stands at the top, beloved by all around her.
 
**Narration:**
The reason she shelters humans is because, by doing so, she will receive their praise in turn.
 
**Narration:**
The reason she acts as a symbol to the fairies is because, by doing so, she will receive their admiration in turn.
 
**Narration:**
The reason she appears to be an exceptional leader is because she has no quarrel with anyone.
 
**Narration:**
The reason she survived this long is not because she was strong.
 
**Narration:**
But because she excels at dragging the other leaders down.
 
**Narration:**
Whenever a fairy more popular than herself appears, she makes the world take a turn for the worse with those ideas of hers.
 
**Narration:**
This was one such case...
 
**Narration:**
She possesses no malice whatsoever.
 
**Narration:**
She simply believed, from the bottom of her heart, the Mirror Clan were dangerous fairies.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;Aaa. Haa&mdash;haa&mdash;......aaa.
 
**Narration:**
And so I slaughtered them. I slaughtered them, just like she desired.
 
**Narration:**
It was clear as day that the Mirror Clan was innocent.
 
**Narration:**
But I had to kill them. Because otherwise, Aurora would be the one to end up dead.
 
**Narration:**
Things always going your way. A world that revolves around you.
 
**Narration:**
Genuinely believing that to be is Aurora's true nature as a fairy.
 
**Narration:**
That is why, for her, there exists neither good nor evil.
 
**Narration:**
For 3,000 years, the reason she never lost her radiance was because her self-esteem was out of this world.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Ahh......uuu......aaa&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
I covered my face with hands stained in the blood of the Mirror Clan, as if to block out the view.
 
**Narration:**
I had no right to ask for forgiveness, nor did I have the right to apologize.
 
**Narration:**
Despite knowing the sort of person Aurora is, I still placed her radiance above all else.
 
**Narration:**
Because, to me, Aurora is more important than all the fairies in Britain.
 
**Narration:**
Aurora is without sin. I am the only wretch here.
 
**Narration:**
A false love depending on me. I continued to commit sin after sin, all because I did not want to lose it.
 
**Narration:**
But that day was special. The Mirror Clan was special.
 
**Narration:**
They were gentle fairies protecting that which was once me. The carcass of Albion.
 
**Narration:**
Not a single one of them resisted. On the contrary, they seemed to pity me.
 
**Narration:**
Those women stepped up and offered their lives.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But there was no other way...because Aurora would have died otherwise.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I'm not to blame...I never wanted to kill them. Aurora... Aurora, you need to hear this.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's right...for you, I...if you would thank me with just a smile, that's all I&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
I chose not to fly, so as to not leave any evidence behind. That night, I returned home, covered in mud, and concealed myself.
 
**Wind Fairy:**
To think the city of the Mirror Clan vanished... I wonder what could have happened.
 
**Wind Fairy:**
They say it was a Mors attack, but...Mors scaling the city's ramparts, really...?
 
**Wind Fairy:**
It must've been Queen Morgan...wrathful towards Ainsel's prophecy&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
Surely that is not the case. Queen Morgan is a prudent person.
 
**Aurora:**
The prophecies of the Mirror Clan, which foretold the future, were priceless to her.
 
**Aurora:**
In the first place, Ainsel was a great clan head who worried for Britain's future.
 
**Aurora:**
Ahh, poor Ainsel...to think this would happen...
 
**Aurora:**
Whatever attacked the Mirror Clan is something that does not belong in this world.
 
**Aurora:**
Surely it is the foulest beast in all of Britain, rotten in both body and soul.
 
**Aurora:**
No matter how hard it tries to appear beautiful on the surface, in the end, it is but a pale imitation of me.
 
**Aurora:**
Oh, how detestable&mdash;just the thought of a creature like that makes me squirm.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;, &mdash;
 
**Narration:**
It was a miracle. A genuine miracle.
 
**Narration:**
She gently embraced that lump of flesh writhing in the dark swamp, as though it were something precious.
 
**Narration:**
“Hello, sweetheart. Or should I say, good morning?”
 
**Narration:**
“I am Aurora. Do you have a name?”
 
**Narration:**
That was the moment I gained a heart. Gained a form. Understood emotions. Understood yearning.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;I felt an unwavering love that could never be undone.
 
**Narration:**
But&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Of course...that's the sort of fairy she is.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's the sort of fairy she is...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Even I know...why she embraced me back then...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I know...I know...I am unloved, I know...!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But even so...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Even so, I love you...I love you, Aurora...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That's right...as long as I have this heart, I can remain the way I am.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Even if I should lose Queen Morgan's gifted name, I can remain the way I am. As long as I have Aurora.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Should she disappear...I will return to my old self.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
To the 'me' who carried the grudges of the northern fairies who perished in the Spring War 8,000 years ago.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I need to head for Salisbury...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Even if Britain is coming to an end...my life shall be hers until the very end&mdash;
 
**Fairies:**
Ki-■ ■! Ki-■ ■! Ki-■ ■ the northern fairies, the invaders who beckoned the Calamity!
 
**Fairies:**
Are there any fairies ravaged by the Mors poison!? If you find any, grab them and ki-■ ■ them before they turn into Mors!
 
**Fairies:**
Round up the humans! Have them fight the Mors! Ki-■ ■ any reluctant humans to set an example!
 
**Fairies:**
The cathedral! Open the cathedral gates! This city has been defiled, flee to the cathedral!
 
**Fairies:**
Lady Aurora will surely help us! Lady Aurora will surely save us!
 
**Fairies:**
After all, she is the new queen of Britain! She will surely sacrifice herself to the Mors for us!
 
**Aurora:**
How horrifying...and to think all of you once used to be such gentle fairies...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;Aurora.
 
**Aurora:**
Who goes there!? How did you get in here!?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It's me, Aurora... I landed on the bell tower above us and came down here.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The city's in a terrible state...The majority of the fairies have organized themselves into a mob.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Eventually, they will make their way into this cathedral.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I would much rather not say this, but...Salisbury has...
 
**Aurora:**
Well&mdash;I suppose so. I suppose that is true. But you're here, Mélusine!
 
**Aurora:**
Thank goodness you're safe! Are you hurt? You aren't, are you?
 
**Aurora:**
After all, you are Britain's strongest Fairy Knight. Never will you be hurt, nor will you deteriorate. No matter what.
 
**Aurora:**
You haven't faded one bit since the day we met, my precious knight.
 
**Aurora:**
You really came through at the right time... you truly are the only one I can rely on.
 
**Aurora:**
Yes...Salisbury is at an end. No, the entirety of Britain is...
 
**Aurora:**
Surely, there no longer exists a path to salvation for us...
 
**Aurora:**
How did it come to this...it's so very sad...
 
**Aurora:**
And yet, we have no other choice. Mélusine, come with me...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Yes...you're right. We should at least be together for the end&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
Let's make our escape together, shall we? You can take me with you, can't you?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;What?
 
**Aurora:**
Did that surprise you? I think it's only natural to run from danger, though...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It isn't...you've just stopped thinking again.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
What comes after we escape, Aurora...?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Where will you go after you abandon this world and the fairies who believed in you?
 
**Aurora:**
You're right. That is unfortunate. But they no longer love me at all, do they?
 
**Aurora:**
So enough about them. More importantly, why don't we go somewhere more pleasant?
 
**Aurora:**
Outside Britain! You heard it from those people from Chaldea, did you not?
 
**Aurora:**
It should be far better there compared to this boring world.
 
**Aurora:**
I mean, it's a world exclusively for the pitiful, filthy, weak humans.
 
**Aurora:**
It will be much easier to create an ideal world that will be much better behaved.
 
**Aurora:**
You and I will be the only fairies there.
 
**Aurora:**
See&mdash;isn't that what you wish for?
 
**Aurora:**
Such a lovely person, my Mélusine. I love you the most right now.
 
**Aurora:**
Give me your hand. Take my hand in yours. Let's start a new life, shall we?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That is...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That is...indeed what I wish for.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Once again, you will spread those butterfly scales, all too unaware of it.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Telling yourself that you aren't aware...You will do the same once more in the world outside.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Because your purpose is to be 'the most beloved of them all'.
 
**Aurora:**
Mélusine? What's this, all of a sudden?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
What about Coral...? Where is she?
 
**Aurora:**
Coral...? Oh, you mean that Coral!
 
**Aurora:**
I transformed her into a caterpillar, because she was irritating me! And just a few moments ago, I accidentally squashed her beneath my foot!
 
**Aurora:**
There's little bits of her smeared all over the floor. Watch your step, okay? You'll get the floor all dirty.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Aurora...I love you.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I love you, even if you won't believe it, even if it matters not to you.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No matter how evil you may be...I will grant each and every last one of your wishes.
 
**Aurora:**
Yes, yes, that's right! I have no idea what you're talking about, but you're right!
 
**Aurora:**
Let's head for the world outside! I'm sure those wonderful days will start anew.
 
**Aurora:**
&mdash;Hah?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No way that's happening...there's no way that's happening...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
There's no way that's happening...!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
There's no way you could possibly be loved in the world outside...! Because here is the only place where you can stand at the top...!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Pan-human history isn't as gullible as Britain, they'll immediately see you for the poison you are...!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Do you think you could live on in a world like that!? You, who can't live without clean, pure water!
 
**Aurora:**
&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Those wings, that form, they will all fade and waste away in no time! When...when that happens&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You yourself won't be able to stand it... You won't be able to love yourself anymore, and you will despair.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
And yet you will continue to deceive yourself, even in a form far removed from your present, you will continue to live the way you always have&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
And with each sunrise, you will continue to die in front of a mirror.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It may be nothing out of the ordinary for the other fairies...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
But for you, it would be the cruelest torment of them all.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Unable to muster the resolve to die, weeping in despair that only grows with each passing day.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
And yet, you will keep on clinging to an unreachable glory. A new hell where you would just continue to loathe yourself.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
That&mdash;something like that&mdash;!
 
**Aurora:**
Hehe...what are you talking about, Mélusine?
 
**Aurora:**
Putting such an impossible future into words. You horrible, mockery of a fairy.
 
**Aurora:**
Even though wasting away day by day is far more dreadful than death, you know?
 
**Aurora:**
Ah...more importantly&mdash;hurry up and take me&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
To the world outside&mdash;to the days of being loved by everyone once more&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
You live for my sake, do you not?
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I do...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It would've been fine if I were a creature living for myself.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Because then&mdash;I would've kept you alive, no matter the cost.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Because, without you, I would go back to being a lump of flesh. But&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I cannot help but live for your sake. And for that, I cannot bear to bring you into the hell outside.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Ugh...uuuaaaaaaaa&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;uuuuaaa&mdash;aa...a...&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Ah...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Even now, I still remember. It comes to mind, forever and ever.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
The wind that swept across the dark swamp. A dazzlingly brilliant aurora.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;I swore my life to defend you with everything I had.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I love you, Aurora...I love you, Aurora.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
&mdash;Even...even should I lose this form of mine.
 
**Aurora:**
&mdash;
 
**???:**
&mdash;aaa&mdash;
 
**???:**
&mdash;AaAaAa, Aa&mdash;
 
**???:**
&mdash;Aaaaaaaaaaaa&mdash;
 
## Section 29: A Prophecy 
 
**Gordolf:**
The density of magical energy in the atmosphere is rising dramatically, and a second highly concentrated magical signature has appeared!
 
**Gordolf:**
On top of that, Cernunnos has vanished from the Great Pit!?
 
**Gordolf:**
Well, it would be a big help if that's true! Can you explain what the devil is going on, Technical Advisor!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
The reason the magical energy density in the air is increasing is because all the fairy corpses are burning up!
 
**Da Vinci:**
This isn't going to cause any problems right away, so let's just ignore it!
 
**Da Vinci:**
I haven't been able to monitor the second high-energy magical signature yet, so that has to wait too!
 
**Da Vinci:**
As for the Great Pit&mdash; The Great Pit&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Sorry, I don't even know where to begin! All our measurement data is missing for just that spot!
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's as if time itself has been rewound around just the Great Pit!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hold on, I'm confirming a space-time ripple on the bridge! Something's coming through! Everyone, brace yourselves!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're back!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's happening right now!?
 

---

 
**Gordolf:**
Fujimaru! Kyrielight, Artoria Caster!
 
**Gordolf:**
Wait, you came directly back here!?
 
**Gordolf:**
No, forget that, give me a report! Make it quick, no more than five minutes!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...and that's what happened in Avalon.|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
So Muramasa is gone now too, huh...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Mash, bring the Round Table Shield to the analysis room. Place the Holy Sword's essence in storage while you're at it.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I'm on my way right now!
 
**Holmes:**
Now then, let's take stock of the situation. Very well done, Fujimaru.
 
**Holmes:**
The truth behind the birth of the British Lostbelt. What happened to Cernunnos, and the truth behind the Great Pit.
 
**Holmes:**
The developments around the Great Pit have been reset thanks to Merlin the Magician.
 
**Holmes:**
And then...the Holy Sword forged in the Inner Sea of the Planet, and its guardian, Artoria Caster.
 
**Holmes:**
With this much information, we can begin to form a strategy.
 
**Holmes:**
Captain, patch me through to Professor.
 
**Nemo Professor:**
Speaking~. I've been listening to everything up till now~.
 
**Holmes:**
The observation data on the Great Pit is all gone, but we still have the ship's logs, right?
 
**Holmes:**
Using those, I'd like you to calculate the time between Cernunnos' appearance and the flood of curses.
 
**Holmes:**
Additionally, the battle against Cernunnos is liable to be at close range using Servants deployed on the Border's main deck.
 
**Holmes:**
Physical defenses are a given, but take steps to counter magical contamination from curses.
 
**Nemo Professor:**
You don't think we can just bombard him using the Storm Border?
 
**Nemo Professor:**
I believe that if the target is a large structure, bombardment would be more effective.
 
**Holmes:**
We can attempt it, of course. But conventional physical means may not be effective.
 
**Holmes:**
It may have the spiritual core of a god, but it's buried under that thick mass of curses it has for flesh.
 
**Holmes:**
As long as the curse itself is driven by the flesh, the correct approach would be to “exorcise” it rather than defeat it.
 
**Holmes:**
Artoria Caster. Or perhaps Grimm the Wise.
 
**Holmes:**
Only a spiritual attack blessed by those two could possibly provide interference.
 
**Holmes:**
(Most of all...we're missing the deciding factor after that...)
 
**Holmes:**
(I'm sorry, Captain, but we may have to bet everything on sacrificing the Storm Border...)
 
**Nemo Professor:**
I see, I see~. It's true the ship is not equipped to perform spellcasting.
 
**Nemo Professor:**
Oh, got it. Thirty minutes until Cernunnos appears.
 
**Nemo Professor:**
Last time, the Great Pit was overflowing with curses after an additional hour.
 
**Holmes:**
There you go, ladies and gentlemen! Win or lose, we have an hour and a half!
 
**Holmes:**
Our greatest enemy is of course Cernunnos in the Great Pit. But before that, there is another Calamity that must be stopped!
 
**Holmes:**
We cannot afford to let this Calamity escape the island of Britain.
 
**Holmes:**
If it does, that means its existence will be accepted as part of pan-human history.
 
**Holmes:**
The Calamity is moving from Manchester to Norwich by way of Oxford...
 
**Holmes:**
Defeat Barghest quickly, and make preparations for Cernunnos' appearance in the Great Pit!
 
**Holmes:**
Neither we nor Britain have time to spare, so the operation begins immediately!
 
**Holmes:**
Master Fujimaru, Artoria Caster, and Grimm...
 
**Holmes:**
Captain and the Marines, formulate a strategy for defeating Cernunnos here!
 
**Holmes:**
Professor and Da Vinci, you two work on the Storm Border's anti-curse barrier&mdash;
 
**Nemo:**
Wha&ndash;!?
 
**Holmes:**
What's happening!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An attack from outside...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just now, on the monitor
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
Impact, starboard astern! It broke through our physical defenses in one blow!
 
**Meunière:**
The armor's burned through too! Our inner passages have been exposed!
 
**Meunière:**
Damn it, we've lost one of the Marines! Damn it...!
 
**Nemo:**
&mdash;I'll replace him, Meunière, confirm our status first!
 
**Nemo:**
Da Vinci, what was that heat signature just now!?
 
**Nemo:**
The only way to penetrate the Storm Border's armor should be with a Divine Construct!
 
**Da Vinci:**
I've got it! Putting it on the monitor!
 
**Holmes:**
That's&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A fighter jet...?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No, a dragon...!
 

---

 
**Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
It's reached 1200 km/h and it's still accelerating! Whoa, it's bouncing off the magical energy in the atmosphere!
 
**Nemo Marine (Observer, Left):**
Mach 1, Mach 2, and still increasing! It's gone supersoniiiiic (in tears)!
 
**Nemo Marine (Observer, Right):**
Wait, how can it even maneuver at that speed!?
 
**Nemo Marine (Observer, Right):**
Oh no, nononono! It's turning back towards us! It's heading for the booww!
 
**Nemo Marine (Observer, Right):**
Impact in 10, 9, 8...!
 
**Nemo:**
Increase altitude! Maximum acceleration! If we're hit head-on, the bridge will be torn apart!
 
**Nemo:**
Escape into the upper atmosphere right before it changes course!
 
**Meunière:**
Woooaaahh!
 
**Meunière:**
Urgh, we just barely made it! It just grazed the tip of the bow!
 
**H：Nemo Marine:**
Distance from hostile 10—14 km! Ah, it's turning back around again!
 
**H：Nemo Marine:**
What should we do, Captain!? It's definitely gonna hit us!
 
**Nemo:**
I know, just keep climbing! There's no way we can disengage!
 
**Nemo:**
We just have to pray that our altitude limit is higher! Da Vinci!
 
**Nemo:**
What the hell is that thing!? Don't you have any new data!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I do! That attack just now wasn't from a talon, it was magical energy expelled from the mouth of the enemy!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Barghest wasn't the only one razing the lands of Britain!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Breath that can tear up the earth through heat alone, acceleration unaffected by air pressure or temperature,
 
**Da Vinci:**
and absurd wings that allow flight that spits in the face of inertia!
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's no mistaking it. That's the third Calamity&mdash;the pure-blooded dragon, Albion!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The third Calamity&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(So that's Albion, which means...)
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Albion's pursuing the Border! If the stern is struck by its breath, we're finished!
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's sharp enough to cut through our physical defenses like paper, and one hit could sever our engine!
 
**Nemo:**
All hands, take a seat and buckle in! Da Vinci, calculate the timing of the next breath attack!
 
**Nemo:**
Two seconds before impact, deploy gravity sails to maximum spread and drop the ship!
 
**Nemo:**
We'll bounce the ship all over the sky! If we stay still, we're dead!
 
**Nemo:**
Then, as soon as we've dodged its breath, we'll level out and maintain altitude!
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's coming! It's within range! 6, 5, 4, 3!
 
**Nemo:**
Bow up! Deploy the sail! Full tuuuuurn!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uwaaaaaaa!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Border is rotating vertically!?
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
Captain, we're above the sea of clouds! Damn it, we've depleted the magical resources we've been stockpiling up till now!
 
**Meunière:**
What now!? We won't be able to avoid the next one!
 
**Nemo:**
Tch...
 
**Artoria:**
May I? I may be able to stop it as I am now.
 
**Artoria:**
But I can't protect the entire ship, and it will only be for a few minutes.
 
**Artoria:**
Which part...well, if it's just that one you call the engine section, then I can deploy anti-purge defenses.
 
**Artoria:**
Would that be sufficient to overcome this?
 
**Holmes:**
That would be very promising. But first I have a question, Artoria Caster.
 
**Holmes:**
Why is it attacking us? The Calamities should be destroying the fairies of Britain.
 
**Holmes:**
Were we not supposed to be off their radar?
 
**Artoria:**
Huh? Uh, well...I don't think I can answer something like that yet...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's because we've obtained the means to save Britain.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
As you were before, Chaldea was just a bump in the road as far as the Calamities were concerned.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
But now, Artoria has returned, and we're devising a way to defeat Cernunnos.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
“Fairy of Paradise.” “Enemies of Britain.” That's how they sense us.
 
**Holmes:**
I see. We were just bystanders before, but now that we've obtained a deadly weapon, we've become suspects...
 
**Holmes:**
If that's the case, then it's a different story. It's not after us.
 
**Holmes:**
It's after Artoria Caster. So, that being the case...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see...Holmes...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't like where you're taking this, Holmes...
 

---

 
**Holmes:**
Yes. By merely putting Artoria out on the main deck, we can narrow the enemy's focus.
 
**Artoria:**
Hah!?
 
**Holmes:**
Artoria will raise her hand on the bow deck and draw Albion to her.
 
**Holmes:**
When Albion comes in to finish her off, we engage it in close-quarters combat.
 
**Holmes:**
I call it Operation Titanic. What do you think, ladies and gentlemen?
 
**Artoria:**
How can you even suggest something so ridiculous!? What kind of Heroic Spirit are you anyway!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's the world's greatest detective.|
 
**Artoria:**
I don't know what that word means! Maybe pan-human history deserves to be destroyed!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But it's our only countermeasure...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
No, even should it take the bait, in that situation I wouldn't be able to put up a barrier to protect the ship.
 
**Artoria:**
I can either act as bait for Albion or protect the ship from its breath.
 
**Artoria:**
It's one or the other. I can't do both.
 
**Gordolf:**
Damn...! I thought we could do this, only to be told it's impossible after coming this far...!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Artoria, if something can't be done, say it plainly.
 
**Da Vinci:**
At a time like this, it's not a matter of how you feel, it's a matter of carefully measuring your abilities.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If Artoria says we can't do it, then we have to give up on the idea.
 
**Percival:**
No, it could work. You just need a decoy, is that right?
 
**Percival:**
If so, then I'll draw in the dragon. Artoria, please focus on protecting the ship.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Percival!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Weren't you undergoing treatment in the sickbay...!?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, Percival insisted on coming up to the bridge...
 
**Holmes:**
Your offer is appreciated, Percival. But there's no point in you doing it.
 
**Holmes:**
The Calamity is after the Fairy of Paradise. Nobody aside from Artoria can&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
You're right, but if it's only to act as substitute, I can do it.
 
**Percival:**
I hold the Spear of Selection, a tool of the Fairies of Paradise.
 
**Percival:**
I'm an artificial Child of Prophecy. There is none more suited for this role than I.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
That thing no longer harbored humanoid sapience. This fact did not detract anything in particular from it.
 
**Narration:**
The vengeful grudges of the northern fairies, lingering from past ages.
 
**Narration:**
A mass of decaying cells expunged from the dragon's skeleton.
 
**Narration:**
In other words, a doomsday device meant to incinerate the bodies of the fae.
 
**Narration:**
It was no more than an “inanimate object”. Pain is there no more, lament is there no more, love is there no more.
 
**Narration:**
The instructions running through its brain were exceedingly simple.
 
**Narration:**
“Reason: unknown.” “Objective: prevent the collapse of the British Island.”
 
**Narration:**
“Target: hostile airborne craft” “Target: bow of hostile airborne craft”
 
**Narration:**
“Action: elimination” “Action: extermination”
 
**Narration:**
It shot across the twilight sky. The sound of the wind gave way to a cry as it soared.
 
**Narration:**
It felt nothing. Nothing at all. No current resembling a humanoid's could be found flowing through it.
 
**Narration:**
“Target: acquired. Target: acquired. T a r g e t&mdash;”
 
**Narration:**
As fluctuations presented itself in its visual information, pain ran through its heart, which should have been a hollow cavity.
 
**Narration:**
The figure of the target standing on the bow of the hostile airborne craft appeared so very&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
Alright...I'm still good to go.
 
**Percival:**
I'll pull through somehow...will you watch over me, guys?
 
**Percival:**
I understand the plan.
 
**Percival:**
I won't be able to move from the bow, so I'll leave the dragon slaying to you all.
 
**Percival:**
I'm in no condition to fight, anyways. Being a decoy sounds about right.
 
**Percival:**
Come now, don't look so hurt.
 
**Percival:**
I'm content with this. The two of you need not worry about me.
 
**Percival:**
However...the thing is, I do have a final request to make.
 
**Percival:**
I would like to request that you bear no ill will towards Britain and the fairies.
 
**Percival:**
There are benevolent fairies and malevolent fairies, just like how benevolent humans and malevolent humans exist.
 
**Percival:**
There is no such thing as an evil race, just as there is no such thing as an evil society. Only two alignments.
 
**Percival:**
I possess no knowledge of pan-human history. However, I can say this with confidence.
 
**Percival:**
Even if this is the end result...
 
**Percival:**
No matter how sad it may be, no matter how painful it gets...
 
**Percival:**
The Fairy Kingdom of Britain was a beautiful land. A wonderful world.
 
**Percival:**
Our Britain is doomed to perish...however, that does not make it a mistake.
 
**Percival:**
It is not because this was an evil world.
 
**Percival:**
What ought to remain shall remain. What can continue on will continue on.
 
**Percival:**
That is all there is to it. That is why I beseech you, hold your heads high.
 
**Percival:**
Ours is a world that has arrived at this point after over 10,000 years.
 
**Percival:**
It was a premature, incomplete world&mdash;however, yours still has a future.
 
**Percival:**
Since there is still a future, I would like you to reach it someday.
 
**Percival:**
Beyond your own thousands and thousands of years.
 
**Percival:**
Reach the destination known as utopia, where all men, all life, will find salvation.
 
**Percival:**
Hmm...I suppose it's too little, too late. But I feel like I've said something rather conceited...
 
**Percival:**
Well, what's done is done. I was able to make Fujimaru and Mash laugh too!
 
**Percival:**
Now then&mdash;let's do this. I am Percival, Knight of the Round Table!
 
**Percival:**
This is the final defensive, I shall strive to live up to that name!
 
**Percival:**
...
 
**Percival:**
Nevertheless...this is quite something.
 
**Percival:**
Standing atop a flying ship feels like something straight out of a fairy tale.
 
**Percival:**
Yes. If all goes well, I shall brag about this to Gareth and the Round Table Army.
 
**Nemo:**
&mdash;Hostile draconic organism, approaching! This vessel will now proceed to fly parallel to the hostile craft at maximum speed!
 
**Nemo:**
Judging from the amount of fuel remaining, we only have one shot at this strategy!
 
**Nemo:**
Master, you will deploy all the firepower you can to the utmost with Artoria Caster at its center.
 
**Nemo:**
Ten seconds to contact!
 
**Nemo:**
&mdash;This marks our first battle against a Calamity, best of luck to everyone!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
The hostile draconic organism has withdrawn from the deck! We weren't able to defeat it...!
 
**Nemo:**
No, we cannot let it escape...! There won't be a next time if it retreats here!
 
**Nemo:**
We have to finish it off no matter what...! Engine, get us more speed!
 
**Nemo Engineer:**
That's fine and all, but the Border won't hold up, you know!? It's going to get all warped, starting with that exposed part on our starboard!
 
**Nemo Engineer:**
We're done for if the ship's keel gets warped, Captain Bastard!
 
**Nemo:**
Damn it all, what a disaster! We're letting it go&mdash;all because of my inadequacy...!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;No...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll settle this...
 

---

 
**Nemo:**
Huh? But we no longer possess the means.
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Not to worry, Captain. Please maintain our current speed.
 
**Mash:**
She will fall here. Because Britain's strongest knight stands on the bow of this ship.
 
**Percival:**
Should Queen Morgan fall, you would be free...
 
**Percival:**
The role of a Fairy Knight binds you.
 
**Percival:**
I once thought as much. For that reason alone, I established the Round Table Army.
 
**Percival:**
That's right, I&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Who even swings a sword around while crying? Come on and take a break, Percival.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You're doing well. Far better than those fairies lounging about.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
I'm so proud of you. As expected of the child who persevered to the end of the selection process&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Jeez, why are you crying even harder!? Ah... I see, that wasn't very nice of me...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Sorry for being such an insensitive sister... You see, I don't have a good grasp on human emotions...
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Of course you wouldn't. After all, you were the only one chosen.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
You were so close with the rest of them. You had no choice but to get stronger, even if it brought you pain.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Alright, in that case, I also have something I can teach you.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
It's fine even if you feel an obligation towards your friends, even if you can't come to love yourself.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Someday you will find something you deem even more precious than yourself. After all, it was the same for me!
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
Don't forget this, Percival.
 
**Fairy Knight Lancelot:**
No matter how horrible a world this Britain may be, if you can find even one thing you can love, then&mdash;
 
**Percival:**
Yeah...
 
**Percival:**
And for that, I have deceived many. I shall accept my punishment here.
 
**Percival:**
&mdash;Holy Lance, call to order.
 
**Percival:**
O Spear of Selection, if you will, deliver unto me righteous judgement for my deeds.
 
**Narration:**
The Spear of Selection pierces through the heart of the dragon carcass.
 
**Narration:**
The dragon carcass loses its strength and falls. The knight's body shatters, unable to endure the ensuing deterioration.
 
**Narration:**
His end is reflected in the eyes of the falling dragon.
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
&mdash;a&mdash;aa, a&mdash;a&mdash;
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
&mdash;Percival&mdash;Percival&mdash;
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
&mdash;Perci&mdash;val&mdash;
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
&mdash;my&mdash;
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
&mdash;little brother&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
Pain shoots through its hollow heart. The sound of the rushing wind being engulfed in flames, in that moment, resembled the sound of tears.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Gordolf:**
Well done, all of Chaldea. The same goes to you, Artoria Caster of Britain!
 
**Gordolf:**
But we cannot afford to pat ourselves on the back just yet! Technical Advisor, I want a report on our current situation!
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Storm Border has sustained extensive damage on its starboard side. Furthermore, significant loss of fuel has occurred due to our battle just now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We'll need to keep the Border stationary in midair while we refuel and repair the armor.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Assuming we can extract the atmospheric mana,
 
**Da Vinci:**
it will take at least 20 minutes to repair the ship. I'd like to have 30, if at all possible.
 
**Gordolf:**
O-oh, that long!? Please do something about that!
 
**Gordolf:**
Administrative Advisor, how are we looking!? What do you make of this time loss!?
 
**Holmes:**
20 minutes have passed since we engaged the Flame Calamity.
 
**Holmes:**
30 minutes to go until the Storm Border is once again ready for combat.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Cernunnos surfaces in 10 minutes...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And in an hour, the curses will overflow, so...
 

---

 
**Holmes:**
That's correct. We won't be present when Cernunnos surfaces. However, we do have a grace period of 40 minutes until the terminal catastrophe.
 
**Holmes:**
Our prospects are looking good, provided it's only about defeating Cernunnos. However&mdash;
 
**Holmes:**
The problem is the other Calamity, Barghest.
 
**Holmes:**
She's razed Oxford to the ground and should soon arrive at Norwich, with a pack of Black Dogs in tow.
 
**Holmes:**
The Storm Border is not capable of simultaneously taking them both out. If we wish to eliminate them, we will have no choice but to split up.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Truth be told, I think it'd be wise to give up on that one. As they say, we've got bigger fish to fry.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The Great Pit brings a Calamity of global proportions, while the Black Dog is one that razes cities.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The world won't end even if we let her be.
 
**Holmes:**
I am of the same opinion, Grimm the Wise...
 
**Holmes:**
Once she heads out to sea from Norwich, Barghest will be perceived as a Calamity by pan-human history.
 
**Holmes:**
Of course, the fairy Barghest from English fairy folklore will be treated differently as a result of that, but...
 
**Holmes:**
We can deal with that Calamity in the future. It is not our current priority by any means.
 
**Mash:**
No, please wait! I request a separate deployment!
 
**Mash:**
I understand our priorities. That all our resources should be focused on Cernunnos.
 
**Mash:**
Even so...even so, I beg you! Please, let me head out!
 
**Mash:**
I can't allow Barghest to become an enemy of pan-human history!
 
**Mash:**
Besides...besides, Norwich is Boggart and Barghest's hometown.
 
**Mash:**
To have her destroy it with her own hands is far too&mdash;
 
**Gordolf:**
Kyrielight&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, I guess you have a point.
 

---

 
**Gordolf:**
Are you up for it, Fujimaru...?
 
**Gordolf:**
Mash Kyrielight is your personal Servant. If you decide you're up for it, I shall grant permission.
 
**Gordolf:**
We still don't know the sort of Calamity that Barghest has turned into...
 
**Gordolf:**
The battle will be a fierce one. You are aware of that, I presume?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Naturally.|
 

---

 
**Gordolf:**
Very well! Holmes, devise a strategy! I don't care how reckless it is!
 
**Gordolf:**
Within the time it takes for the Storm Border to depart for the Great Pit, that is!
 
**Gordolf:**
Furthermore, Artoria Caster will remain on the Border!
 
**Gordolf:**
Should you fail to return, she will be our trump card against Cernunnos.
 
**Gordolf:**
Rather...Artoria Caster and Grimm, as well as the Storm Border.
 
**Gordolf:**
As long as these three are present, it should be possible to eliminate Cernunnos.
 
**Gordolf:**
If you fail to make it in time for our take-off, we'll leave you behind without a second thought.
 
**Gordolf:**
Listen up, be sure to return immediately should it turn out to be a lost cause! And you must be sure to be punctual!
 
**Gordolf:**
For the first time, I will not abide any rule-flouting on this matter. Consider yourselves stuck in a cell all week long should you break that rule!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Yes, sir!|
 

---

 
**Holmes:**
&mdash;Goodness gracious. The bar has been raised on the difficulty of this mission.
 
**Holmes:**
Nevertheless, I do prefer difficult cases over simple ones. I will respect the choice you've made.
 
**Holmes:**
I figured this would be the case, so I finished the Shadow Border's maintenance while you were descending down the Spirit Cave.
 
**Holmes:**
As for its driver...
 
**Holmes:**
Mister Meunière, may I request you drive again?
 
**Meunière:**
S-sure, leave it to me! I've gotten used to being airdropped, anyways!
 
**Holmes:**
Then it's decided. The ones who will purge the Calamity at Norwich will be our elite force,
 
**Holmes:**
{(M)Mister/(F)Miss} Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight.
 
**Holmes:**
The operation time will be 30 minutes. We cannot afford to spare more time than that.
 
**Holmes:**
We will catapult the Shadow Border and have it land close to Norwich.
 
**Holmes:**
Once you have eliminated Barghest, the two of you will make your way to the rendezvous point via the Shadow Border.
 
**Holmes:**
The Storm Border will retrieve the Shadow along with its personnel and make its way to the Great Pit.
 
**Holmes:**
Is there any problem, Da Vinci?
 
**Da Vinci:**
No, that's perfect. I wanted some extra time too on a separate matter.
 
**Da Vinci:**
After a scan, I've found a reason to go to Salisbury regardless.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I have to go and get something I forgot. I left Tifone behind at Mike's tavern.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Recorded in it are a bunch of memories of our trip. I'd like to retrieve it if possible.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Speaking of Mike's inn, Habetrot's also there!|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, of course...she's been made to play a difficult role.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Once it has launched the Shadow Border, the Storm Border will head for Salisbury.
 
**Da Vinci:**
We'll have the ship stand by above Salisbury while I personally head down to pick Habetrot up at the tavern.
 
**Da Vinci:**
After that, the Border will head for Norwich's vicinity where we will await your arrival.
 
**Nemo:**
Looks like that settles it. Then let's commence the operation.
 
**Nemo:**
The Marines will work with Engineer and Nurse to repair the starboard armor!
 
**Nemo:**
As for the separate detachment, hurry up and board the Shadow Border! The ship will continue to head in Norwich's direction until launch preparations are complete!
 
**Nemo:**
Once the Shadow Border has been launched, we will steer towards Salisbury and send Da Vinci down!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger that! Please stay safe, Da Vinci!|
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
No need to worry, I know Mike's tavern like the back of my hand!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Let's meet up later, Fujimaru! I believe you'll stay safe!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
Curse you. Curse you. Curse the Fang Clan.
 
**Narration:**
One day, a beast will be born among you. A Black Dog, stronger than all others, born in the shape of a person.
 
**Narration:**
“Oh, it's your reward for exorcising the Mors King. Accept it gratefully.”
 
**Narration:**
One who harbors the Wild Rule. One who lives by the law of the jungle.
 
**Narration:**
A disgusting, otherworldly fairy who lives off of that which they love.
 
**Barghest:**
Uuurgh...aaah...aaaaaaaa...
 
**Barghest:**
Uuurgh...Aaaaah, ah&mdash;Uuuaaaaaah...!
 
**Narration:**
She sobbed as she devoured the flesh of the fairy she loved.
 
**Narration:**
This time it was a new one, not of her clan, but derived from the young of the forest.
 
**Narration:**
It was a rugged, splendid fairy, one stronger than she was. She recognized it with a single glance, became infatuated, and made love to him.
 
**Narration:**
She loved him truly, from the bottom of her heart. That's why, she thought, this time it wouldn't happen.
 
**Barghest:**
Aaah...Aaah...Haah...Aaaaaah&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
Her appetite was relentless.
 
**Narration:**
She vomited it back up many times in self-loathing, but her mouth, throat, and gullet were slick with rapture.
 
**Narration:**
Delicious. Pitiful. Despicable. Because she truly loved it, the meat was especially delectable.
 
**Narration:**
It had been 400 years since she was born into Britain.
 
**Narration:**
Her mind had long since collapsed, her predation a mixture of love and joy, of grief and pain.
 
**Narration:**
Every time she lost a lover, she pondered commiting suicide, but abandoned the idea.
 
**Narration:**
Dying would be easy. But then, everything she had ever done, every act she had taken, would be boiled down to her appetite.
 
**Narration:**
Her first prey. The citadel lord Foul Weather. It was only to save Britain that she ■ ■ ■ ■-ed him.
 
**Narration:**
She took that superior Mystery into her own flesh, and waged war on the Calamity.
 
**Narration:**
It was her nature to love the strong. To make it her flesh and blood in order to do so.
 
**Narration:**
That is the law of the jungle.
 
**Narration:**
So long as she lived eating that which she loved, dying merely because she wanted to was unacceptable.
 
**Narration:**
As long as she was born strong and brought up as a daughter of her Clan, she had to take responsibility for snatching them away.
 
**Narration:**
As long as there were those who believed in the Child of Calamity, she had to exemplify justice more than anyone else.
 
**Narration:**
That pride was the only thing that held together her shattered heart.
 
**Barghest:**
Aaah...Aaaah...Aaaaaaah...!
 
**Narration:**
Even so, she had reached her limit here.
 
**Narration:**
There was no way an abomination like her should be allowed to live.
 
**Narration:**
She sobbed while pulling out her blade, trying to end her own life&mdash;
 
**Boy with a Cane:**
Hello? Is there someone crying out here?
 
**Narration:**
In the year 2,000 of the Queen's Calendar, she met a sickly human child.
 
**Barghest:**
Haah...haah...haah...
 
**Barghest:**
Manchester...Manchester...I have to...hurry...
 
**Barghest:**
Manchester's fairies...to Chaldea&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
To get him...to give Adonis...a little more time&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
It had been 17 years since she met him that day...
 
**Narration:**
The days since then had been happy ones.
 
**Narration:**
For the first time, she knew peace and happiness.
 
**Narration:**
“Loving only the strong...” She was confused, yet happy to know love that ran against that rule.
 
**Narration:**
He was obviously weak. There was no way he would become her prey.
 
**Narration:**
For she who ate the strong in order to become stronger,
 
**Narration:**
that love was proof that she was no beast, and she took solace in that.
 
**Narration:**
And so she swore to protect him at all costs...
 
**Narration:**
She decided to fight for that beautiful heart.
 
**Narration:**
The coexistence of humans and fairies. An equal relationship.
 
**Narration:**
Even if it was difficult for the entirety of Britain, she thought it would be possible within her own territory.
 
**Narration:**
The fairies of Manchester agreed with her. They were all too happy to emigrate to pan-human history as well.
 
**Barghest:**
...Britain...is done for...
 
**Barghest:**
The Mors have overrun Camelot...and soon they will take the other cities...but...
 
**Barghest:**
I have to gather all the citizens of Manchester and make it to the shoreline where Chaldea is before that...
 
**Barghest:**
...I can't go with them...but at the very least&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
She went through the forest, arriving at the streets of Manchester.
 
**Narration:**
However...
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;What?
 
**Narration:**
What she beheld was the fairies of Manchester, laughing as they ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ the humans.
 
**Fairies:**
Clean them out, clean them out! We're moving soon, so let's clean out all the old playthings!
 
**Fairies:**
It's fun to pluck off all their limbs! It's fun to yank out their guts!
 
**Fairies:**
That first scream is the best! None of the later ones measure up!
 
**Fairies:**
■ ■ ■ ■, ■ ■ ■ ■! Let's finish before Barghest comes back and finds out!
 
**Fairies:**
If she finds out we've been hiding them in the sheds, she'll get furious!
 
**Fairies:**
If she finds out we've been ■ ■ ■ ■-ing them in the shed every day, she'll swoon!
 
**Fairies:**
Loving Barghest! Gluttonous Barghest!
 
**Fairies:**
“Why didn't you let me in on it too?!” She'll beat us all!
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;What...the&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;What are you&mdash; &mdash;What are you all doing&mdash;?!
 
**Narration:**
She screamed at the citizens who had become monstrous fairies. They sneered back at her, laughing.
 
**Fairies:**
What? It's just like you and your plaything! We all know about it!
 
**Fairies:**
We saw what's in the mansion! We know what you were hiding!
 
**Fairies:**
What fun, playing house! What a lovely story!
 
**Fairies:**
Every day seemed so fun! We're just imitating you!
 
**Barghest:**
Killing humans? This is...imitating me...?
 
**Barghest:**
Killing humans&mdash;I...killed&mdash;
 
**Barghest:**
Ah. &mdash;Ah...ah&mdash;
 
**Fairies:**
You were so nice to him! You treasured him!
 
**Fairies:**
Barghest ate him! She ate him in the back of her mansion!
 
**Fairies:**
It was so, so funny! So we did it too!
 
**Fairies:**
Fun fun fun, more fun than watching! It's such fun to ■ ■ ■ ■ humans!
 
**Barghest:**
A&mdash;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
 
**Barghest:**
Uurgh...Urraaa...Uaaaaaaaaaah...!
 
**Narration:**
I dreamt of the “act” several times.
 
**Narration:**
I am crying. I am sobbing while that which is my lover is being ■ ■ ■ ■ ■.
 
**Boy on the Bed:**
You're crying again, ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■. Now now. Come here.
 
**Boy on the Bed:**
Just tell me what happened to you today. It's okay if you cry.
 
**Boy on the Bed:**
It's going to be fine. No matter how pitiful it was, I won't hate you.
 
**Narration:**
I ■ ■ ■ only the strong. So there is no way I would ■ ■ ■ him.
 
**Boy on the Bed:**
Hey, when you have a rough time, you should talk about something you like. How about your beloved Knights of the Round Table?
 
**Boy on the Bed:**
The flotsam that washed ashore in the Changeling. Showy, prideful, and rather lonesome.
 
**Boy on the Bed:**
The story of those gallant knights you so adore.
 
**Narration:**
But I had long since been broken. Strong or weak made no difference.
 
**Boy on the Bed:**
Look at the garden. The flowers you planted are coming in beautifully.
 
**Boy on the Bed:**
You put in a new one for me today, since I can't walk.
 
**Narration:**
A vile beast, wanting only to ■ ■ ■ that which I loved.
 
**???:**
Taking your life to atone for your sins? I know how you must feel, but take a step back.
 
**???:**
It would be lamentable if the most virtuous fairy of all forfeited her life.
 
**???:**
I'll make a contract with you, Barghest. It's still a little too early for you to succumb to the curse.
 
**???:**
I'll put a lid on this memory. He can live on in your heart as long as you like.
 
**???:**
Oh? If it gets to be too much, come back to this room. You can relive his final days in your dreams.
 
**Fairies:**
Now let's go, let's go! Let's jump over to the outside world, where there are a lot of humans!
 
**Fairies:**
Fun, fun! It's sure to be ten times as much fun!
 
**Fairies:**
Let's play, let's play! Let's have fun with the humans! We read all about them in the flotsam!
 
**Fairies:**
All about those things called demons!
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;, &mdash;
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;I had to kill them, I thought.
 
**Narration:**
I was mistaken. I was mistaken about what I had to protect. From the very beginning, there was no justice on this island.
 
**Barghest:**
&mdash;aah, Aah&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
“You must take responsibility. They must never leave this island.”
 
**Fairies:**
Look everyone, Barghest is laughing! That ever-hilarious drama is about to begin again!
 
**Fairies:**
Crybaby Barghest! So happy, she's crying!
 
**Fairies:**
What will your prey be this time? Don't be stingy, let us have some too!
 
**Narration:**
“Kill every single one of these evil creatures.”
 
**Spriggan's Guardsman A:**
Whoa, another tremor!? Even the Vault Fortress is no good! It's all over for Norwich!
 
**Spriggan's Guardsman B:**
Let's get out of here! If we stay here, we're dead! We'll be chewed up along with the city walls!
 
**Spriggan's Guardsman A:**
What about Lord Spriggan!? Shouldn't we take him with us!?
 
**Spriggan's Guardsman B:**
Who cares!? He's shut himself in the treasury! He's no lord of mine anymore!
 
**Spriggan's Guardsman B:**
Fine, I'm opening the doors! Once we get outside, we'll head for the harbor!
 
**Spriggan's Guardsman B:**
If we make it out to sea, at least we won't burn&mdash;
 
**Spriggan:**
Escaping? You fools, where exactly are you going to leave this work of art for?
 
**Spriggan:**
My Vault Fortress will not fall.
 
**Spriggan:**
Britain's strongest iron tower, built over 100 years of reinforcing the bell tower.
 
**Spriggan:**
I don't care how many Mors are outside, this tower alone will stand!
 
**Spriggan:**
Waah, stop, please! This is going too far!
 
**Spriggan:**
What if all the art I've collected is damaged!? Who's going to compensate me!?
 
**Spriggan:**
Nobody will! Yes, nobody! Even Morgan didn't understand the value of these items!
 
**Spriggan:**
Imitating these is unthinkable! True, 90% of it are empty and shallow fakes.
 
**Spriggan:**
But the remaining tenth&mdash;yes, miraculous works of art to be found in the mud!
 
**Spriggan:**
There was 'art' that could even be likened to truth! There was a magnum opus that could only have been born in this country!
 
**Spriggan:**
Yes. Yes, that's it!
 
**Spriggan:**
If you know not of its value, then that's fine. It's utterly ridiculous to converse with the mediocre over every little matter!
 
**Spriggan:**
Britain's works of art belong to me. That is all I have lived for!
 
**Spriggan:**
Ever since that day, ever since that night. Ever since that moment I strayed into this world!
 
**Spriggan:**
My very soul has grown fascinated with this world! To collect these treasures is my reason to live!
 
**Spriggan:**
I shall not let anyone else have it! I shall not hand it over to another soul!
 
**Spriggan:**
I would much rather have Britain be destroyed than give up on this vault!
 
**Spriggan:**
Damn it, that's enough! What am I, jinxed? What on earth is&mdash;
 
**Spriggan:**
&mdash;Dear me.
 
**Spriggan:**
Dear me...
 
**Spriggan:**
No...no. How volatile of me.
 
**Spriggan:**
I did say I'd rather have it be destroyed...but even madness will die down if one were to gaze upon that thing.
 
**Spriggan:**
Goodness gracious...Not only did I misjudge my business partner, but to think I'd even lose my momentum in breaking it off.
 
**Spriggan:**
Yes. I did want a moronic puppet. However, even that has its limits.
 
**Spriggan:**
There's nothing more unmanageable than a stuck-up snob. And that makes me the clown for looking down on it.
 
**Spriggan:**
However&mdash;
 
**Spriggan:**
To think that Britain's end would come not at the hands of Queen Morgan or Chaldea, but on the whims of a foolish woman.
 
**Spriggan:**
No matter how prosperous we may be, our starting foundations are small.
 
**Spriggan:**
And so we collapse all so easily from the bite of a small insect.
 
**Meunière:**
Alright, nice landing! Norwich is straight up ahead, let's floor it!
 
**Meunière:**
The temperature outside is the same as Manchester, over 1000℃! There are Black Dogs everywhere!
 
**Meunière:**
Fujimaru, I'll repeat the instructions Holmes gave!
 
**Meunière:**
Given our prior engagements with Barghest and our encounter at Manchester,
 
**Meunière:**
humans with low magic resistance will have their life sucked out just by approaching her!
 
**Meunière:**
In other words, you can't stand on the front lines! You will have to make do with remote summonings from inside the Shadow Border!
 
**Meunière:**
Barghest's magical energy devouring has a range of 1 km in radius! This is our first time summoning at this distance!
 
**Meunière:**
According to Nemo Professor's calculations, the summoning limit is one Servant! Two if you're pushing your limits!
 
**Meunière:**
Nemo Nurse also had something to say! 'Fighting by summoning two Servants earns you a ticket to the brig!'
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger that, I'll summon two Servants...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll do my best to support Mash.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...! Please do, Master!
 
**Meunière:**
Well, you won't listen anyway! I'll let Nurse scold me right alongside you then!
 
**Meunière:**
&mdash;Whoops, a high-grade magical signature has been confirmed! 6 km ahead, smack dab in the middle of Norwich!
 
**Meunière:**
I'll put the feed from our long-distance scope up on screen! That's Barghest right now&mdash;woaaaah!?
 
**Meunière:**
She's over 40 meters tall!? And eating thunder to boot!
 
**Meunière:**
We don't stand a chance against that monster without the Storm Border!
 
**Meunière:**
It's not too late, want to turn back!?
 
**Meunière:**
Holmes said so too, didn't he? In the worst case scenario, we don't have to deal with this one!
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;No. We'll go, please let us go!
 
**Mash:**
There is no need to fear that thing! Barghest seemed stronger before!
 
**Meunière:**
Seriously? Barghest's amazing! Damn it, Fujimaru, you're fine with this, right!?
 
**Meunière:**
If you won't hit the brakes, we have no choice but to go for it!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Keep going straight.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Be careful, Mash!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Understood! Opening hatch, starting magical energy reinforcement of the legs. Mash Kyrielight, here I go!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!|
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
Fujimaru, get a hold of yourself! This is why I told you not to push yourself!
 
**Meunière:**
I've been monitoring it too, but it's a lost cause! Not just its battle prowess, but the way it consumes magical energy is anathema to mages!
 
**Meunière:**
There's no way we can win with just Mash alone, let's withdraw! Contact Mash right away and&mdash;
 
**Meunière:**
&mdash;What's happening? Mash's shield is glowing...?
 
**Meunière:**
Hmm? There's a new Saint Graph signature?
 
**Meunière:**
I'll put the Saint Graph data up on the screen, Fujimaru. Do you recognize it?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No doubt about it...!
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
What are you suddenly standing up for&mdash;wait, did you just inject yourself with an active ampoule like an idiot!?
 
**Meunière:**
You're still pressing on!? Didn't they tell you the limit is two Servants!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, because&mdash;|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's Mash's fight!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
The flames scorching the city...the demonic hound that incinerates fairies and devours black smoke and lightning...
 
**Mash:**
You've completely turned into a different creature, haven't you...?
 
**Mash:**
Your eyes can no longer tell that this city is Norwich, nor do you remember your own name...
 
**Mash:**
An opponent I lack the means to defeat...Your average Heroic Spirit would only end up as its prey...
 
**Mash:**
Even so! I cannot afford to lose to you, not in this city!
 
**Mash:**
For those who held you in high regard! For those who wished to return to this city!
 
**Mash:**
Your&mdash;no, the shield of the Knight of Righteousness that you so admired is right here!
 
**Mash:**
Rob, Wag, Winky...
 
**Mash:**
The 'me' they believed in is, by no means, someone who would falter in a place like this...!
 
**Mash:**
I am the Knight of Sheffield, Mash Kyrielight!
 
**Mash:**
A member of the Round Table! The one who will purge the Calamities and save Britain!
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
A most excellent speech. Not one filled with rage against the enemy, but a cry meant to inspire oneself.
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
Having those words reach me, I could not possibly restrain myself.
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
It may be a nuisance to suddenly have me acting like your senior, but I beg your understanding in that regard.
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
May I join you on the battlefield, Dame Mash?
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
To think you would beat me to the punch, Sir. And here I thought protecting the beautiful damsel was my role.
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
&mdash;But it would appear I have made a hasty call in that regard as well. She has no need of an escort.
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
That fighting spirit, such bravery, truly she is like spring thunder. She stands out, even among our ranks.
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
I won't let you monopolize the privilege of fighting alongside her, Sir Gawain.
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
Even should she call me a doting parent for it.
 
**Mash:**
T-this feels like parents' day, Father!
 
**Mash:**
N-no, that's not what I meant. How did the two of you make it here!?
 
**Mash:**
Heroic Spirits of pan-human history are unable to be summoned to this Britain...!
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
That appears to be the case. However, we also appear to be exceptions.
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
There must have been individuals in this country who received our names.
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
If they've been using them freely, then it stands to reason that there'd be place for us as well.
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
Well, it's like trading existences, so to speak.
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
Hmm, I have no way of knowing who received my name, but&mdash;
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
I'm grateful for their foolhardiness, or rather, their great efforts. Thanks to them, I stand now on the greatest of proving grounds.
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
This Saint Graph won't last for more than a few minutes, but that will suffice. I'll leave the left foot to you, Gawain.
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
Our opponent is a demonic hound, much like Cath Palug. This is no time to be feuding.
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
Right back at you. Be sure not to fight rashly just because you're in front of Dame Mash.
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
There are three Knights of the Round Table present here. Defeat is out of the question.
 
**Knight of the Sun:**
Let's go, my fellow Round Table comrade! Let us carve open a path for the knight of the shield with our own hands!
 
**Knight of the Lake:**
On it! Lancelot shall hereby sally forth!
 
**Mash:**
Thank you, both of you!
 
**Mash:**
Please bestow upon me the power to defeat her... no, the chance to save her!
 
**Mash:**
Her name is Barghest, a most loyal knight who protected this Britain.
 
**Mash:**
One who fulfilled her duty as one of the powerful, one who wished for the survival of the weak.
 
**Mash:**
The Black Calamity. The head of the pack of fairy-eating beasts.
 
**Mash:**
As one of the Round Table&mdash;I will halt her advance here!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Meunière:**
High-grade magical signature...disappeared...
 
**Meunière:**
The flames shrouding Norwich have disappeared as well, as has the black smoke...
 
**Meunière:**
She did it, Mash did it, Fujimaru! She purged the Calamity! That's impressive!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hehe, my kouhai's amazing, isn't she?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah...she really did her best.
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
No, you were cutting it close too...! Two remote summonings, and back-to-back at that...!
 
**Meunière:**
That's enough from you, fasten your seatbelt and take a nap!
 
**Meunière:**
Ten minutes to go until we rendezvous with the Storm Border. Mash should be back soon...
 
**Meunière:**
Alright, we'll make it just in time! Relax and lie back!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In that...case...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This was...a little demanding...
 

---

 
**Peperoncino:**
I wonder why I always know what you're aiming for.
 
**Peperoncino:**
The both of us are fundamentally awful people. We thought more about the end than the journey.
 
**Peperoncino:**
Make sure you remember that. Don't let your guard down until it's all over, alright?
 
**Mash:**
Haa&mdash;aaa.
 
**Narration:**
The battle came to an end. The Calamity had been purged by the Knights of the Round Table.
 
**Narration:**
On the verge of death, what appeared to be tears could be seen in the red eyes of that titanic demon hound.
 
**Narration:**
Were they tears of suffering, or tears of gratitude? I hope they were tears of suffering, but we'll never know.
 
**Mash:**
Thank you, Sir Gawain and Sir Lancelot...
 
**Mash:**
I was able to display it at the very end, thanks to your efforts.
 
**Mash:**
Display righteousness by vanquishing evil... The figures of the Round Table Knights that she longed for.
 
**Narration:**
Nevertheless, the price of victory was far too great.
 
**Narration:**
The report of the night Sheffield fell mentioned signs of the Shield of the Round Table initiating consecutive summonings.
 
**Narration:**
The Fairy Kingdom imported the title 'Knight of the Round Table' and gave it recognition.
 
**Narration:**
Therefore, the existence of the Knights of the Round Table was permitted in this Lostworld.
 
**Narration:**
That was the greatest advantage possessed by Galahad—no, Mash Kyrielight.
 
**Narration:**
The summoning itself was performed by the Round Table and the Heroic Spirits that appeared were constrained by time limits.
 
**Narration:**
Even if there was no contractual price to pay, Mash's stamina and vitality would still be scraped off.
 
**Mash:**
Bodily functions, diminished by fatigue, but no lasting damage...no respiratory impediments either...
 
**Mash:**
Thank goodness...I'll be able to return to action after a short rest.
 
**Mash:**
Oh, I have to contact Meuniére.
 
**Mash:**
I will return to the Shadow Border in three... no, four minutes. Please stand by&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
In her current state, it would take around three minutes for Mash to recover her stamina and magical energy to a level where she could resume operations.
 
**Narration:**
She would be able to return to their vehicle—this so-called Shadow Border—sitting two kilometers away in less than a minute.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;However...
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;?
 
**Narration:**
Little Red Riding Hood, beware the big bad wolf.
 
**Narration:**
If you fall asleep now, the wolf will come and get you.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Look out, Mash&mdash;!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh no you don't, Beryl!!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Senpai...!? No, why are you here!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I had a bad feeling about this, so I dashed here!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't need a reason! End of story!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
No, you should be receiving treatment right now! Master, get behind me!
 
**Mash:**
Thanks to you, I've recovered my stamina at breakneck speed! Thank you for warning me!
 
**Beryl:**
Fuuuuuu&mdash;huuuuuu&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
Haaaaa&mdash;......AAah 
 
**Beryl:**
You can't possibly be this much of a killjoy. You actually rushed in from over there.
 
**Beryl:**
You're a lousy Master. Didn't they teach you to stick to the rear?
 
**Beryl:**
The tasting I've been saving for this moment's been ruined, all thanks to you. Haahaa&mdash;damn it all.
 
**Beryl:**
To think I'd screw up like this. Looks like I'm losing my touch, huh?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;(What a rancid smell...)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That body's already...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Beryl Gut...so you're still alive.
 
**Beryl:**
Oh, I couldn't possibly go and die on you. After all, I still have a reason to live.
 
**Beryl:**
Isn't that right, Mash?
 
**Beryl:**
I do apologize...I've been neglecting you for so long.
 
**Beryl:**
I haven't grown tired of you or anything like that. It's just there are a lot of things that keep getting in my way, you see.
 
**Beryl:**
Not only can we not be together, just like we used to back then,
 
**Beryl:**
you've also gotten so lively, moving around and all...
 
**Beryl:**
Just as the doctor expected. I do miss that infirmary at Chaldea.
 
**Beryl:**
You seemed so bored. So out of compassion, I gave you some stimulation.
 
**Beryl:**
Even if you don't have human emotions, pretty much everyone responds to pain.
 
**Beryl:**
The sound of fingers breaking, the sound of pain leaking out, they all reverberated so well.
 
**Beryl:**
Like a concert hall before a performance. It was just me and Mash, just the two of us in the whole world!
 
**Beryl:**
Haa...my head hurts. What the hell is happening?
 
**Beryl:**
Doesn't matter. The Doctor isn't here. There's another obstacle, though...
 
**Beryl:**
But whatever, I'll take care of that in no time... sorry for making you wait so long.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What the hell are you&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you saying...
 

---

 
**Beryl:**
What? I'm talking about love, you know, love.
 
**Beryl:**
I just want to love Mash. Not kill her. So please, get out of my way.
 
**Beryl:**
Hey Mash, won't you talk to me? We're just having a conversation.
 
**Beryl:**
This is an expression of my love.
 
**Mash:**
Yes...you never had any hostile intentions, no desire to kill me.
 
**Mash:**
In the infirmary, when you were breaking my fingers... you even tended to my body.
 
**Mash:**
You listened intently to my voice as I responded to the pain.
 
**Mash:**
You&mdash;said that was love.
 
**Mash:**
That the figure of someone suffering in pain, rather than rejoicing with happiness, is what strikes a chord in you.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Beryl, you're&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's not love you're feeling.
 

---

 
**Beryl:**
But of course. We're all only human. There aren't many people we can call kindred spirits.
 
**Beryl:**
The same goes for hobbies and tastes. To understand each other is&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
Ahh...damn it all. I wanted to spend more time, but...
 
**Beryl:**
My head's burning up here. The Mors curse is getting to me.
 
**Beryl:**
But that's fine. All it means is that I won't be able to act human anymore.
 
**Beryl:**
I'll have my bride before that happens. You can give me your blessings, kouhai.
 
**Beryl:**
Feel free to save the world. We all have our hobbies.
 
**Beryl:**
I don't get it myself, but I won't stop you. So&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
Don't get in my way.&mdash;Don't get in the way of someone's love.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Narration:**
Beryl Gut was a mage, but his primary occupation was that of a killer and his raison d'être alike was to kill.
 
**Narration:**
He learned black magic from his mother, who was one of the 'rejects' of the magical world&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
A creature known as a “witch”.
 
**Narration:**
For the Mage's Association, “female mages” are not classified as “witches”.
 
**Narration:**
“Witches” are inhuman beings.
 
**Narration:**
The founders of a faculty in the Mage's Association... the department of witchcraft and pharmaceuticals, Yumina.
 
**Narration:**
Supernatural beings involved in the establishment of the First Magic.
 
**Narration:**
However, “witches” are no longer involved with the Mage's Association.
 
**Narration:**
One after another, with the development of civilization, those women changed their forms and way of being.
 
**Narration:**
Beryl Gut's mother was one of them.
 
**Narration:**
There are many ways in which “witches” change themselves.
 
**Narration:**
There are those who returned to the earth, those who returned to the past, and those who joined the First.
 
**Narration:**
For mages, these changes were akin to miracles and are held in awe.
 
**Narration:**
On the other hand, there are also “witches” who immersed themselves in human society and became “human”.
 
**Narration:**
These fallen “witches” receive neither reverence nor pity.
 
**Narration:**
No matter what magecraft they possess, no matter how much Mystery they hold, no mage will acknowledge these women as people.
 
**Narration:**
An “unsightly reject”. That is the fate which awaits those witches who survived until the present day as humans.
 
**Beryl as a Boy:**
Hey, old hag. Why do witches die when they fall in love with humans?
 
**Narration:**
Beryl once asked the “witch” he called Mother this question.
 
**Narration:**
His mother, who in her robes could have been mistaken for a giant toad, said:
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
Kihihihihihi, that's simple, kihihihihihihihi!
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
Because it dilutes the blood. Because it rots the soul.
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
Kihihi, kihihihihihihihi! We are fairies, we do not birth children!
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
I am my own daughter! Kihihi, kihihihihihi! Kihihi...hi... hihi...
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
But I am a hopeless failure! I failed, I failed!
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
Aaa, aaaaaaa, aaaaaaaaaaa! How did I even end up like this!
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
Please take me back, please take me back! Please take me back to how I used to be!
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
I envy Meinster, I envy that girl! What should Yumina's direct line do!?
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
Even though I failed, even though I was deceived! Aah, if only I had never met a man like that!
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
If only I had never gotten involved with humans! I wouldn't have had to give birth to a child like you!
 
**Narration:**
After those words left her mouth, “Mother” hurriedly apologized to Beryl.
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
It was a slip of the tongue...it was a mistake. I'm sorry, Beryl. My dear, cherished boy.
 
**Beryl as a Boy:**
It's alright, old hag, I understand. I know you didn't mean it.
 
**Beryl as a Boy:**
If you cry that much, your starry eyes will go to waste, you know? That part of you alone is more beautiful than anyone else.
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
Beryl...! Thank you, thank you...!
 
**Witch Gathering Dust:**
You're the only one on my side...you're the only one I live for...
 
**Narration:**
Beryl Gut learned a variety of witchcraft from his “mother” who hid from human society.
 
**Narration:**
An insidious ritual. A witch's cauldron that crossbreeds organisms.
 
**Narration:**
It is not clear to what extent these techniques, which in essence use “life as an ingredient”, affected Beryl's personality.
 
**Narration:**
Hunting prey, concealment of oneself, lethal poison, malignancy of karma, amplification of pain, loan of misfortune.
 
**Narration:**
Beryl preferred magecraft oriented towards assassination and torture, and his mother was more than happy to teach him such things.
 
**Beryl:**
You have nothing left to teach me? I see. That's unfortunate, Mother.
 
**Narration:**
Beryl crushed his mother's eyes and left the forest behind.
 
**Narration:**
After that, he lived free. He enjoyed life as a mage specializing in murder.
 
**Narration:**
But he went way too far, and it became hard for him to live, even in the underbelly of society.
 
**Narration:**
While he was looking for a place to belong, he was scouted by the Director of Chaldea, Marisbury Animusphere.
 
**Narration:**
And then, he made Chaldea's Antarctic base his third home.
 
**Narration:**
There, he met a creature so unsightly he couldn't believe his eyes.
 
**Beryl:**
Oh man, are you for real? What the hell is that?
 
**Beryl:**
Isn't Chaldea supposed to be a humane organization for the preservation of the Human Order? Does stuff like that fly here, Doctor!?
 
**Narration:**
By unsightly, it was not in reference to one's appearance. By unsightly, it was in reference to one's way of life, one's way of being.
 
**Narration:**
She wasn't complete. She was as a premature baby. “She's just like a balut,” Beryl laughed.
 
**Narration:**
On top of that&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
Her name. What's that girl's name, Doctor?
 
**Beryl:**
That girl is special. I guarantee it because I've given her a thorough appraisal.
 
**Beryl:**
No matter how premature she may be now&mdash;in time, she will be more beautiful than anyone else.
 
**Narration:**
Beryl Gut had a talent for “growing flowers”, perhaps stemming from his mother's teachings.
 
**Narration:**
Even if it looked shabby now, in ten years time, it would blossom into a beautiful flower.
 
**Narration:**
Convinced of that, Beryl decided to watch over the flower's growth. His boring days became rather enjoyable.
 
**Beryl:**
But you know, to tell the truth, I'm not much of an artist&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
Whenever I visit a new country, I always drop by its art museums.
 
**Beryl:**
I've seen landscapes and paintings well-received by everyone, but none of them moved me in particular...
 
**Beryl:**
Of course, I knew they were well made. But that's the extent of it.
 
**Beryl:**
I “don't know what is beautiful”. I always thought of myself as being that kind of guy.
 
**Beryl:**
But&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;I've fallen in love, Mash. I was finally able to confront myself with that.
 
**Beryl:**
I won't hurt you because I hate you, or because it's fun.
 
**Beryl:**
I will hurt you because you are precious to me. Because I love you, I will hurt you to love you.
 
**Beryl:**
That is who I am.
 
**Beryl:**
You only realize something is beautiful after it has been tarnished.
 
**Beryl:**
I will protect you.
 
**Beryl:**
From everyone. From everything. From the Doctor, too. I won't let Marisbury have his way.
 
**Beryl:**
I won't let them carve a Sirius Light onto you. I made that a condition for becoming part of their cleanup crew.
 
**Beryl:**
Please...just remember this.
 
**Beryl:**
As long as you're here, I won't die. A world with you in it is one I enjoy.
 
**Beryl:**
You don't believe me, do you? I'm the same. I can hardly believe it.
 
**Beryl:**
You're the most important thing to me in the entire world.
 
**Beryl:**
That's why&mdash;
 
**Beryl:**
That's why...it's okay, right Mash? I really want to see you suffer, no matter what.
 
**Doctor:**
Beryl Gut&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
Beryl Gut was temporarily detained and his means of access to that facility confiscated.
 
**Narration:**
These events occurred a year before that fateful day, when the A-Team conducted their first Rayshift experiment.
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;Oh, that's odd.
 
**Beryl:**
Why am I being beaten, Doctor...? Are you going to take it away from me again?
 
**Beryl:**
Please wait, you can't do that. I haven't realized it yet.
 
**Beryl:**
It's because they said you'd be here that I agreed to something as stupidly tiresome as coming back to life.
 
**Beryl:**
It's all so I could see you&mdash; so I could see you&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If you get any closer...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
It's fine...please leave him be, Master. He can no longer do anything.
 
**Beryl:**
Yes...you have fine eyes. Your eyes, they're so beautiful...
 
**Beryl:**
You need to take good care of them...you only have two of them...take good care...
 
**Beryl:**
You don't have to run...I'll protect you...
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;I love you.
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;I love you, Mash.
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;I love you, Mash. From the bottom of my heart.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I'm sure that is truly the case. But&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
I do not understand your love.
 
**Mash:**
Perhaps no one ever will, Beryl Gut.
 
**Beryl:**
&mdash;
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Shadow Border is headed towards Norwich. I'm up next. I'll be back in twenty minutes.
 
**Gordolf:**
U-understood. I hear Salisbury is the most peaceful city in Britain.
 
**Gordolf:**
I doubt you'll run into any danger there, but... are you sure you don't want any escorts?
 
**Gordolf:**
Captain and the Marines have their hands full with the Storm Border's repairs, but...
 
**Gordolf:**
How about asking Grimmlainn or Artoria Caster to help?
 
**Gordolf:**
W-well, this is a tough call to make, but depending on the circumstances, Holmes or even I can accompany you.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You would, Gordolf? You hate Singularities, don't you?
 
**Gordolf:**
I hate both Singularities and Lostbelts! I don't even want to imagine getting off the Border!
 
**Gordolf:**
But I can't afford to say something like that this time. Let's just say I have a bad feeling about this...
 
**Da Vinci:**
You're such a worrywart. I'm glad you feel that way, but I'll get things done faster on my own.
 
**Da Vinci:**
They think I'm a fairy over in Salisbury. Besides, I know the place well.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Not to mention, there's only one jet backpack. I'll be down in a jiffy, head over to the tavern,
 
**Da Vinci:**
and I'll be back with Habetrot in tow.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'll be off, then. Captain, please take care of the Storm for a while.
 
**Nemo:**
Got it. I may be the captain, but you're the brains behind this ship. I pray for as swift a return as possible.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh c'mo~n, Professor can handle it just fine. Captain, you charmer.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But I'm glad you're counting on me! If you're going to go that far, I'll just have to come back right away!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
The city is burning...it's been burning for a long, long time now...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Lady Aurora's Voice of the Wind is nowhere to be heard...everyone in the city's changed...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Of course...I knew it...deep down inside, everyone envied each other.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Pretending to laugh while glaring daggers... secretly ridiculing while acting sad.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
That's the sort of creatures we are...so it's inevitable. This was inevitable.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
It's gotten so quiet in the tavern...even though everyone shared so much laughter here...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
No one's coming anymore...Britain is...coming to an end...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
But it's fine...things are just going back to how they used to be...after all, this is how my tavern used to be...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Gloomier than the shops on the main street... mediocre and boring...just like me...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
The last few days have been so fun, so special... almost like a lie.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Whew! Somehow, I managed to get here without being spotted!
 
**Da Vinci:**
That was a close shave, a close shave indeed. Gordolf was right! Salisbury is smack dab in the middle of civil war!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Ah! Dabinchi! Dabinchi, you're back!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Wooooo, hooooooo! Thank goodness, thank goodness! You're safe!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
There was this terrible incident at the cathedral, wasn't there? I was so, so worried...!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I'm back, Mike. I'm glad you're safe too.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, I wasn't that worried, though.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Your place is built well. And most importantly, you lean on the cautious side, Mike.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I knew you wouldn't go out and riot like the other fairies, or be led astray by rumors.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
O-oh, t-that's right, of course not! I was in the kitchen the whole time, thinking up a new menu!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Come and see, Dabinchi. This one's amazing!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
The buckwheat flour that arrived from Norwich lets you bake the bread dough just slightly!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Add in a bunch of ingredients to it, whip some cream onto it, a bit of ham&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Really, Mike? That's a galette!
 
**Da Vinci:**
This is something not even Norwich, which had freed itself from the Queen's yoke, discovered!
 
**Da Vinci:**
You've been going through trial and error on your own, haven't you? Speaking as a teacher, I couldn't be happier.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
&mdash;Yeah. Yeah, that's right. You're right. I did my best.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
It was hard, but fun. It was difficult, but fascinating.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
It's like an entirely different world compared to when I had nothing to do. I won't let them call me useless-Mike anymore.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Thanks to Dabinchi, I've become a full-fledged fairy.
 
**Da Vinci:**
You exaggerate. You were always a hard worker, Mike.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm sure you would've livened up the tavern eventually, even without me.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
&mdash;Dabinchi? Where are you going? Do you have business on the second floor?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I came here to pick up something I forgot.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I need to pick up Tifone and Habetrot, then immediately return to the ship.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
&mdash;Return?
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
...to where?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Our ship is parked in the sky above. After this, we're off to go exterminate the Calamity.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Speaking of which, Gordolf will scold me for this, but why don't you tag along, Mike?
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's no sign of the riots outside dying down, is there? If it's just you, it won't hinder the operation any.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
N-no...I'm good here. Here's fine.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
T-the tavern's got a basement. It's safe there, no matter what happens.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
It's safe...this place is as safe as it gets.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
There's no need to go out...you can just stay here forever.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Habetrot, are you awake!? She's still conscious!
 
**Habetrot:**
...hnn...aaa...
 
**Habetrot:**
Ah...that voice, you're Da Vinci, aren't you? I figured you'd come pick me up.
 
**Habetrot:**
I really wanted to head over there myself, though... well, no matter.
 
**Habetrot:**
I can tell by the look on your face. We can spare ourselves the explanation.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I suppose so...
 
**Da Vinci:**
How did it come to this? For what reason was this choice made? I can hardly tell.
 
**Da Vinci:**
But, after scanning the entirety of Britain with the Border, I can only come to that conclusion.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Will you help us...?
 
**Habetrot:**
Of course. After all, keeping myself awake the whole time is hard.
 
**Habetrot:**
I'm sorry, but you're going to have to take me with you. My body isn't listening to me.
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's the plan.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Thank you for everything, Habetrot. You truly are a guardian of brides.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
I know, Dabinchi...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
That while you're not a human, you aren't a fairy either.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Fujimaru and the others probably don't know...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
That you may be stronger than humans and fairies... but your lifespan is so, so short...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
That the end...is coming soon...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Alrighty, Tifone II has been retrieved! I took longer than expected, I need to hurry!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Then, you should just stay here forever.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
That's right, you should be able to live a little longer than if you go outside.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Sorry about the commotion, Mike! But you were a great help!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Not just today, but for everything up until now.
 
**Da Vinci:**
If I hadn't met you, our journey would've been a far more difficult one.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Thank you for listening to me that day. Tavern life was so much fun.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'll tell you this, because this may be the last time...
 
**Da Vinci:**
You're a far more wonderful person than you think you are, Mike.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Even happier days await you down the line.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Alright, take care then! I'm off to save the world!
 
**Narration:**
■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ turns on her heels, back towards the exit. Her defenseless back faces me.
 
**Narration:**
If I don't do anything here, ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ will leave. She will leave. She will leave.
 
**Narration:**
I'll go back to being that old, boring me once again.
 
**Narration:**
I don't want that. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm so, so scared. I'm so scared that I can't stand it.
 
**Narration:**
I need ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■. She should stay here.
 
**Narration:**
She'll live longer that way. So, so...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
&mdash;aaa&mdash;aaaaaa...!
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
aaaaa...aaaaaaa&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
The door opens. She's walking away.
 
**Narration:**
The kitchen knife I'd been hiding behind my back falls to the ground.
 
**Narration:**
Drenched in my own tears, I stare at her back as she walks away.
 
**Narration:**
That's right. ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ is...Dabinchi is only Dabinchi because she's free.
 
**Narration:**
She's Dabinchi because she dares to go anywhere.
 
**Narration:**
She shines so dazzlingly precisely because she broadens her horizons and chases her dreams the best she can in what little time she has.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Uuuuuuu...uuu...!
 
**Narration:**
So I have to see her off. I have to keep smiling to the very end.
 
**Narration:**
Up until now, I was able to get anything and everything in the Fairy Kingdom. I thought it was a world of dreams, but I was wrong.
 
**Narration:**
A true 'dream' is something you cannot obtain. That is what makes every day painful yet fulfilling.
 
**Narration:**
It's what makes you feel like giving it your best to go on living. Even in a world that's about to meet its end soon.
 
**Narration:**
Even for dreadful monsters like us fairies...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Yes...yes...
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Farewell, my friend from a faraway world.
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
Thank you for coming to Britain&mdash; Thank you for coming to my tavern&mdash;
 
**Fairy Tavernkeep:**
&mdash;Thank you for these wonderful, dreamlike days.
 
**Narration:**
The angel's wings go on forever and ever.
 
**Narration:**
Straight through that perilous city. Racing towards the other side.
 
**Nemo:**
Mash, Meunière and Fujimaru, who headed for Norwich.
 
**Nemo:**
Da Vinci, who headed for Salisbury.
 
**Nemo:**
Both detachments have completed their missions and have successfully regrouped.
 
**Nemo:**
We will hereby set a course for the Great Pit. However, before we do that&mdash;
 
**Nemo:**
Commander Gordolf, please sign off on the operation, if you will. We do have that much time.
 
**Gordolf:**
U-understood. After all, it's important to sign off! Thank you for your heartfelt attentiveness!
 
**Gordolf:**
To the Lostbelt Investigation Unit, pride of Chaldea. And to our local allies!
 
**Gordolf:**
I hereby announce the start of our campaign to eliminate Cernunnos at the Great Pit!
 
**Gordolf:**
It is expected that this shall be our final battle in Britain. There is no need to take any further combat into account.
 
**Gordolf:**
With all your might...your trump cards, so on and so forth...
 
**Gordolf:**
I'd like you to give it all you've got! Because you lot tend to have things like that up your sleeve!
 
**Gordolf:**
No surprises this time! We will certainly eliminate Cernunnos, as planned.
 
**Gordolf:**
After all, we have already been crushed once!
 
**Gordolf:**
Although we were saved by that mangy Koyanskaya...
 
**Gordolf:**
According to Da Vinci, her Saint Graph signature has not been detected.
 
**Gordolf:**
We believe she has already fled Lostworld Britain! Hmph, that's a load off my shoulders!
 
**Gordolf:**
Listen up, this is our second and last chance! I don't want to hear third time's the charm!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger that...!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll do my best!
 

---

 
**Gordolf:**
Good. Administrative Advisor, the details of our strategy, if you will.
 
**Holmes:**
Understood, Commander Gordolf.
 
**Holmes:**
We have completed repairs on the Storm Border. There will be no issues with cruising and combat.
 
**Holmes:**
On the other hand, 20 minutes have passed since Cernunnos surfaced in the Great Pit.
 
**Holmes:**
Although it'll take another 40 minutes for the Calamity Hands that assaulted us the last time to overflow from there...
 
**Holmes:**
It is expected that Cernunnos will undergo changes, just like the Flame Calamity that attacked the Storm Border.
 
**Holmes:**
To be more specific, I refer to the manifestation of its defensive mechanisms.
 
**Holmes:**
There is a high probability that the Calamity, having sensed that we possess the Divine Construct known as Artoria Caster in our midst, will intercept us.
 
**Holmes:**
It is impossible to evade a plethora of curses of that scale.
 
**Holmes:**
Therefore, we will focus everything on our anti-curse layer defense and take it head-on. Is this correct, Grimm the Wise?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah. On the deck I'll set up a meditative field—a “fountain”.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I am still the God of Wisdom, for the record, even if only as a proxy. If I really focus on it, I can consecrate the entire ship.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I can't block Albion's heat rays, but spiritual interference is another story.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I'll handle Cernunnos' wrath—his curses. We're from the same place, so I'll at least hear his complaints out.
 
**Holmes:**
With Grimm the Wise's assistance, the Storm Border will get as close as it can to Cernunnos.
 
**Holmes:**
Last time, Camelot was destroyed 50 minutes after Cernunnos surfaced. We will eliminate him before that happens.
 
**Holmes:**
Our combatants will be Fujimaru, Mash, and Artoria Caster.
 
**Holmes:**
Naturally, Grimm the Wise will be on the deck. If needed, we Chaldean Servants will also participate.
 
**Holmes:**
The battle can take no longer than 30 minutes, starting now. This is a battle with a time limit.
 
**Holmes:**
Master Fujimaru, be sure to keep that in mind.
 
**Nemo Marine:**
We've passed Oxford! Cernunnos will be in sight in 5 minuuutes!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
You sure we should keep going like this~!? Should we take a little detourrr!?
 
**Holmes:**
That won't be necessary, Marine. Get ready, Grimm the Wise.
 
**Holmes:**
We will hereby commence the purging of the final Calamity!
 
**--ARROW--:**

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(We're almost at the Great Pit...)
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Are you nervous?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I am...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Embarrassingly enough...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Me too! I mean, we're going to be fighting a god!
 
**Artoria:**
We're talking about a god, you know, a god! As far as unreasonable opponents go, that's the highest grade!
 
**Artoria:**
While I may say that, I'm just a neophyte who learned about pan-human history at the Site of Selection.
 
**Artoria:**
You're used to this sort of thing though, right? You must have seen this kind of scenery many times already.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's always like this.
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;I see.
 
**Artoria:**
Hearing that is a relief. It's okay to be nervous.
 
**Artoria:**
Well, I'm going to be the one dropping my staff or something, so when that happens, please coolly back me up.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Haha, that does sound like you, Artoria.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yep! It's not like you can do everything alone! Even if I fail, the people around me will definitely help me out!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, did you find your reason?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
No. That alone, I couldn't. It's frustrating, but I couldn't find a single, convincing reason.
 
**Artoria:**
But, that's okay. I don't know the reason why, but&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
There seems to be someone who knows the reason why 'I'm trying this hard'.
 
**Artoria:**
Oh, that's right, that's not what I wanted to talk about.
 
**Artoria:**
Fujimaru, I'd like to thank you while I have the chance.
 
**Artoria:**
We will be parting ways after we defeat Cernunnos. I'll be going back to Avalon.
 
**Artoria:**
I am the 'remnants' of the last work that Muramasa undertook.
 
**Artoria:**
Once I use up my magical energy, my role will end, and I will fall into a deep slumber.
 
**Artoria:**
Just like how your King Arthur slumbered on her journey to Avalon,
 
**Artoria:**
so too shall I return to Paradise after I have exorcised the Great Calamity.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
For a moment there, I thought you'd
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yes. It's clear where I must return to. It has been ever since I dedicated myself to the Site of Selection&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
No, ever since I drifted ashore.
 
**Artoria:**
However, it would be far too unfair to leave it at that.
 
**Artoria:**
I've been in your care for so long. Allow me to return the favor.
 
**Artoria:**
For us Fairies of Paradise...saving Britain meant denouncing the false Britain...and restoring it to how it should be.
 
**Artoria:**
But, that wasn't the case for you. You wanted to save Britain, even if it happened to be a fake.
 
**Artoria:**
That's why&mdash;I'd like to share the same goal as you, at least once.
 
**Artoria:**
As long as you persevere and hold onto hope, the 'Fairy of Paradise' will answer you.
 
**Artoria:**
Next time, not to save Britain, but to save the world...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah...surely one day.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
By the way, I have a question for you, Fujimaru.
 
**Artoria:**
What has been the most enjoyable part of our journey for you so far? Please leave Manchester out of your answer.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That came out of nowhere...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Umm, in that case...
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The revealing of the Child of Prophecy in Salisbury?|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The diving incident at the Dracae river?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That 'thing you should never have made' in Edinburgh?
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What about you, Artoria?|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Me? Let's see, as for me...
 
**Artoria:**
The chocolate making got me fired up, but Norwich shocked me...
 
**Artoria:**
As for my happiest moment, that would be fourteen days after we met, in the forest of Wales.
 
**Artoria:**
My third handshake with you!
 
**Artoria:**
“But on top of that, I want to help the Child of Prophecy too.” Whew, now that was smoooooth! Woo~hoo~!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash; (blushes)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You actually remember that!?
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yes. That's why, please accept this. This will be the last time.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Our fourth handshake...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you for everything, Artoria...
 

---

 
**Nemo:**
Distance to Cernunnos, 5000! We're dropping altitude and closing in now!
 
**Nemo:**
Two minutes to engage! Remain seated with your seatbelts fastened until then!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Alright then, see you later!|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Although...what I really enjoyed was the eleventh day, at Gloucester.
 
**Artoria:**
It might have been nothing special for you.
 
**Artoria:**
But for me, for the first time in my life, I could walk down the main street with someone I love.
 
**Nemo:**
Entering Cernunnos' estimated vantage point! &mdash;Lookout, report!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
There's movement at our destination! Multiple magical readings from the bottom of the Great Pit&mdash;
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Cursed Hand, incoming[[User:BlameLib
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
BlameLib]] ([[User talk:BlameLibtalk]])! Anti-curse layer, anti-misfortune barrier, deplooooy!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Woah, can this really block it!? It looks like the Niagara Fallllls!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Leave it to me, I'll push it all back in one go!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I hereby speak of life through death!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
O Well of Mimir, leyline of the mistletoe! Sever the past and be the branch that grows into the future!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Forbid all foolery for nine days! Surpass the twilight&mdash;Great God Altar: Gambanteinn Valhalla!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Amaaaazing! That hand turned into light and disappeared, right down to the stem!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
A second wave appears to be on its way, but we shouldn't be in any danger.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Guh...! Damn it, he sent a curse right back at me...!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Hey, as you can see, there won't be a next time! Finish it in one go, Chaldea, Fujimaru!
 
**Holmes:**
Of course we shall!
 
**Holmes:**
The armoring can protect us, but it cannot shield us from the magical pollution in the atmosphere.
 
**Holmes:**
Master Fujimaru will contribute to the battle by way of summoning from the bridge.
 
**Holmes:**
At the same time, he will continue to supply Mash Kyrielight with magical energy!
 
**Holmes:**
We will now launch the Servant offensive!
 
**Holmes:**
Our target is Cernunnos of the Great Pit! We shall completely eradicate Britain's Great Calamity here!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We should've beaten it, but...!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's not working...at all!?
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
Cernunnos has regenerated immediately following the termination of his magical signature! No external damage observed!
 
**Meunière:**
It didn't work, he's not stopping! We just peeled off a bit of his skin!
 
**Meunière:**
Mash! What's the reaction on your side!? Have you noticed anything!?
 
**Mash:**
Yes...!
 
**Mash:**
We've defeated Cernunnos several times, however, there appears to be no lasting damage!
 
**Mash:**
In all likelihood, it's propagating curses faster than we can damage it!
 
**Mash:**
What we're seeing now is a carcass bloated with curses...
 
**Mash:**
I don't think we can purge this Great Calamity unless we attack the source of the curses...!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Well...this about takes care of the first aid.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Whew. A god's still a god, even when he's rotting. No, it's even harder to get rid of him now that he's that way.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
He has a divine core, I realized that after fighting him.
 
**Mash:**
A divine core...are you talking about a Divine Spirit's soul? But, Cernunnos is already dead&mdash;
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Something must have entered the coffin that is his core. An extra special sacrifice. Something that cursed the fairies.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
With that sacrifice, Cernunnos was rebooted as a carcass and surfaced.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
No point in chipping away at the skin, we have to blow that whole thing away along with its core.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But, we don't have that sort of firepower&mdash;|
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
We do, actually. It's been there for a long time now.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The 12 Holy Lances mounted at the gate of Camelot. If we can activate them, we can defeat Cernunnos.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
This is what we must fight for.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's not enough to just prevent Camelot's destruction.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Our role is to hold the line here against Cernunnos and send the Keeper of the Holy Sword to the throne.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
And we've already done that. All that's left is to see this journey through to the end here.
 
**Mash:**
Eh&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Wait a minute.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, where's Artoria...?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
She's not here...Artoria isn't here!
 
**Mash:**
She was gone from the deck by the time I realized&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;So that's...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So that's why earlier&mdash;|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, we're going on the defensive...!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! We'll do what we can&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Reengaging Cernunnos! I will block all of his attacks!
 
**Narration:**
Camelot has become a castle of death.
 
**Narration:**
There are no fairies. There are no humans. No corpses. No Mors.
 
**Narration:**
She dashes through corridors now devoid of all life and majesty.
 
**Artoria:**
Haa, haa, haa, haa&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
She had jumped off the Storm Border and landed on an intact part of Camelot's ramparts.
 
**Narration:**
And now, she was making her way towards the throne.
 
**Artoria:**
It's probably this way, it's got to be this way...!
 
**Artoria:**
I've been here with Fujimaru once, I've got to trust my gut, I can't stop&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
She runs to the point of losing her breath. The battle she had just been in had not tired her out as much.
 
**Narration:**
What hurries her is the giant beast outside the castle, separated by just a single layer of wall.
 
**Narration:**
The silent curses of the deity, Cernunnos, almost seem suffocating.
 
**Artoria:**
I can tell, it's coming, it's coming...! Crawling up from the bottom of the pit...!
 
**Narration:**
Camelot had fallen to the curse that had come crawling out of the Great Pit before the visit to the Spirit Cave.
 
**Narration:**
The curse has been there for an hour since Cernunnos appeared.
 
**Narration:**
There is little time left. Ten minutes at best, five at worst.
 
**Narration:**
She has to reach the throne and analyze the mechanism behind Morgan's throne before that.
 
**Narration:**
And then, readjust it for her own use.
 
**Artoria:**
Haa&mdash;haa, haa, haa&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
In the past, she would've tried to find a different way after dismissing this as 'impossible'.
 
**Narration:**
But now, she knows she can do it.
 
**Narration:**
After returning from the Site of Selection, she is no longer who she used to be.
 
**Narration:**
More than half of her is now an existence of fantasy.
 
**Narration:**
A king who will one day draw the Sword of Selection, and with the Holy Sword in hand, guide Britain into a new age.
 
**Narration:**
She can feel that she is now a part of that concept from pan-human history, that way of being.
 
**Artoria:**
I'm not at the center of the world, but rather, at its edge.
 
**Artoria:**
Like a lighthouse at the farthest reaches, even should time end&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
She remembers the words the mage had once said...
 
**Narration:**
A nostalgic fairy tale. The story of a nameless person, composed of countless hopes.
 
**Artoria:**
This is it, this crossroads, I remember it! Then, up ahead is&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
Morgan's throne.
 
**Narration:**
The masterpiece of Tonelico the Savior, holding the magical energy collected from fairies all throughout Britain, that which controls the Holy Lance.
 
**Artoria:**
Haa&mdash;aaa. Haa...haa...haa...
 
**Narration:**
Behind the throne is a terrace overlooking the Great Pit.
 
**Narration:**
And there lies a deity who 'simply exists'. A towering 14,000 year old carcass.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Haa.
 
**Narration:**
She chokes on her breath and recoils in the face of that sinister figure, at the meaning behind that 'silence'.
 
**Narration:**
The god is justified in its wrath. The god's curses are righteous.
 
**Narration:**
He was killed by the fairies. He reached out with good faith and was rewarded with deception.
 
**Narration:**
His beloved priestess was deprived of both her life and her sanctity. For 14,000 years, the sinners had prospered.
 
**Narration:**
The Calamities were not born of hatred. They were 'obligations' stemming from anger and grief.
 
**Narration:**
“These creatures must not be left to their own devices,”  he said.
 
**Narration:**
He tried to close the lid on the world, as one who once spared their lives.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Nonetheless, you are mistaken, after all.
 
**Artoria:**
If you think Britain is a land of sinners, if you think that's all it amounts to...
 
**Artoria:**
A system is needed to atone for sins, not just punishment. The time to allow for sinners to atone is long since due.
 
**Narration:**
She connects her consciousness to the throne. Becoming one with the 12 Holy Lances installed in front of her.
 
**Narration:**
Crawling. Crawling.
 
**Narration:**
Crawling up from the bowels of the earth with lightning speed.
 
**Narration:**
Foreseeing the end of the curse, its nullification, countless grudges crawl up. As if to say “we won't let you”.
 
**Narration:**
The deaths of fairies, accumulating for 14,000 years, emerge as a torrent.
 
**Artoria:**
Amazing...she really was a genius.
 
**Narration:**
However, rather than feel rushed, she instead feels awe towards Morgan.
 
**Narration:**
Not just for her power as a fairy, but also for her idea of turning the entirety of Camelot into a Mystic Code.
 
**Narration:**
Despite the scale of the formula, there is not the slightest mistake whatsoever in the magical circuit connections and magical energy circulation.
 
**Narration:**
Truly a genius on the level of the divine. The greatest of all the Fairies of Paradise.
 
**Narration:**
The issue being, this mechanism was developed on the premise that it would be used by that genius.
 
**Artoria:**
Uuu...ahh&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
An excess of magical energy runs throughout her body.
 
**Narration:**
She lacks the circuits required to make use of all 12 turrets, and so sparks of magical energy flow out from the throne.
 
**Narration:**
Her blood vessels expand, and it permeates her nerves, bones, and flesh from the inside.
 
**Narration:**
Her consciousness fractures. Her eyeballs rupture. Her respiratory tract burns and her knees are on the verge of giving out.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;But with this&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
She was convinced that she could do it. This time, she won't run.
 
**Artoria:**
Spirit Vein obstruction-type armament— Rhongomyniad: loading. Round Table Holy Lance, 12 units anchored in parallel.
 
**Artoria:**
Anti-Calamity Grand Ritual, open! O Spear of Salvation, be the rain of Orkney—of the farthest end—that washes away all sin!
 
**Artoria:**
Gah...!
 
**Narration:**
The firepower was plenty. It was powerful enough. It had enough power to reduce even the walls of Camelot to ash.
 
**Narration:**
But it still wasn't enough. It wasn't strong enough to purge the accumulated curses.
 
**Narration:**
If the fairies had been here, they would have probably laughed.
 
**Narration:**
Laughed at how the weapon Queen Morgan prepared had failed to kill the god.
 
**Artoria:**
That's not it...! I just haven't mastered it...!
 
**Narration:**
Squinting those eyes that no longer worked. Swallowing the blood that had welled up in her mouth.
 
**Narration:**
Her anger was not directed at the fairies, nor was it directed at Cernunnos.
 
**Narration:**
It was directed at herself, for being reluctant to pay the price. Even now, she had set aside enough power to return.
 
**Artoria:**
To hell with wanting to stay a little longer...! I've already had plenty of that...!
 
**Narration:**
She was supposed to have disappeared at the Site of Selection.
 
**Narration:**
The fact that she came this far was because one of her travelling companions offered his life to give her a little more time.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;All of it. The 'me' standing here, the 'me' who once stood here.
 
**Artoria:**
I will offer it all up. That's why I've come this far.
 
**Narration:**
The Holy Lance Rhongomyniad is Morgan's magecraft. It's only natural she could not fully use it.
 
**Narration:**
She cannot use the Holy Lance. But she can make use of its structure.
 
**Narration:**
If the Holy Lance is a turret, then all she has to do is load a different ammunition into it.
 
**Narration:**
Right now, she is the “concept of the Holy Sword”. In that case, the formula to load is&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Connect the circuit from the throne to this heart...
 
**Artoria:**
Switch the magical energy source from Camelot to the Avalon le Fae.
 
**Artoria:**
Switch from Spirit Vein obstruction-type armament— Rhongomyniad— to Dragon Vein incineration-type armament—Excalibur.
 
**Narration:**
Tens of trillions of cells burning in pain. Enough pain to scorch the universe.
 
**Narration:**
The Cursed Hand, its innumerable fingers, reach the throne room's terrace.
 
**Narration:**
For a moment, her thoughts, accelerated by the pain, stretch into eternity.
 
**Narration:**
And calmly, gently, they replayed the memories of what was once her.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;Morgan, my archenemy in a distant world.
 
**Narration:**
She recalls Norwich.
 
**Narration:**
“I should have done this. I should have done that.”
 
**Narration:**
Such regrets did not come to mind. Instead, she recalled a dazzling scenery.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;I couldn't beat you. I never did beat you.
 
**Artoria:**
I couldn't assert myself through power. I couldn't find the words to retort either.
 
**Narration:**
But she was bestowed with a chance. At the very end, the last bit of magical energy still left in that body.
 
**Narration:**
Using all of it, she had a chance to show who she is.
 
**Fujimaru:**
Did you find your reason?
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;No, I didn't become the ideal me.
 
**Narration:**
But here she stands. Not a ruthless Queen who continued to protect this throne.
 
**Narration:**
But rather, a great and respectable Savior. To reward that life.
 
**Artoria:**
I will do now what you should have done 2,000 years ago!
 
**Narration:**
She holds her head up high against the towering sin. The last of her power as the Fairy of Paradise.
 
**Narration:**
Including all the magical energy that gives her form.
 
**Artoria:**
Holy Sword, draw&mdash;!
 
**Artoria:**
O revered deity, forgive us our transgressions!
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;There was only one thing left behind.
 
**Narration:**
A staff of mistletoe, its purpose fulfilled, sat on the winter throne like a sword.
 
**Nemo Marine:**
12 supreme grade magecraft reactions detected in front of Camelot. 12 simultaneous shots confirmed! They've hit the target!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Cernunnos' Saint Graph signature has gone from negative to positive!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
90% of the external curse layer has evaporated and come off! Something's visible, something's visible!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
That's the divine core! You can really feel the divinity from it!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The core of Cernunnos...!
 

---

 
**Gordolf:**
Well done, Artoria Caster! But&mdash;
 
**Gordolf:**
Isn't the flesh around it writhing? Doesn't it look like it's trying to regenerate!?
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Yep, it's started regeneratiiinng (cries)! Even Rhongomyniad couldn't beat it!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
360 seconds until Cernunnos returns to its original state! What do we do, what we we do, Captain!?
 
**Nemo:**
If that is indeed the divine core, then it cannot be destroyed with this ship's weapons.
 
**Nemo:**
&mdash;Da Vinci, order the crew to abandon ship.
 
**Nemo:**
Use the Shadow Border. The Nemo Series and I will be the only ones staying behind on the bridge.
 
**Nemo:**
As soon as we confirm the departure of the crew, we will accelerate the Storm Border to maximum speed and ram into him as a kinetic weapon!
 
**Gordolf:**
A-a suicide attack!? Don't be stupid, I won't let you do that! What a waste!
 
**Nemo:**
There's no time for debate. Fujimaru, you need to hurry and&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
No, that won't be necessary.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Our mission ends once Cernunnos' divine core has been exposed.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hurry to the deck now, Fujimaru. Mash is waiting for you.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Your Command Spells will be needed for the slaying of a god&mdash;You understand what I mean, don't you?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ah... &mdash;Yes!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;The divine core of the target has been exposed, but at this rate it'll quickly&mdash;!
 
**Mash:**
The opening Artoria gave us...there was a way to make use of it...
 
**Mash:**
If only I&mdash;if only I hadn't been afraid back then...
 
**Mash:**
If only I hadn't run from my choices, from my responsibility, this wouldn't be...!
 
**???:**
It's so frustrating it makes you want to cry, doesn't it? I get it. You were running from the fight back then.
 
**???:**
No matter how gallant and courageous you try to be, you're a person who's fundamentally averse to conflict.
 
**???:**
That still hasn't changed, but&mdash;what lies beyond your gaze has changed.
 
**???:**
You've gained the will to fight, the heart to fight. So there's no longer any need for me to be safekeeping this.
 
**Mash:**
Eh&mdash;?
 
**Mash:**
You're&mdash;Habetrot?
 
**Habetrot:**
Yes. This is something that was once used at the castle of Sheffield. Something you turned your back on.
 
**Habetrot:**
Something that should not be in this Britain. Something precious that signifies who you will become.
 
**Habetrot:**
You call it the Black Barrel, right? Don't forget this time, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;
 
**Tonelico:**
We are simulations projected by the Fantasy Tree, in a 'what-if' world.
 
**Tonelico:**
Mash did not exist in the actual Fairy Calendar, only Galahad did. That is the premise we will work on.
 
**Tonelico:**
Both you and I must not remember anything regarding Mash.
 
**H：Totrot:**
No! I don't want to forget Mash!
 
**H：Totrot:**
Mash will be in danger again in the Queen's Calendar, won't she? I need to be there for her!
 
**H：Totrot:**
Tonelico, you'll be there in the Queen's Calendar too, won't you!? I'll do something about it too!
 
**H：Totrot:**
The coffin of ice! I'll ask Grimm to make me one just like Mash's!
 
**H：Totrot:**
Because I haven't kept our promise yet! I'm going to make an astounding wedding dress for Mash!
 
**Tonelico:**
All fluctuations will disappear with the advent of the Queen's Calendar...
 
**Tonelico:**
You cannot overcome time itself. Not with your memories intact.
 
**Tonelico:**
Even I cannot. It would end up causing a paradox.
 
**Tonelico:**
If this knowledge carries over to the 'me' from the Queen's Calendar, 'I' would cease to be me.
 
**Tonelico:**
We have no choice but to forget Mash.
 
**Tonelico:**
However...if you survive until the Queen's Calendar, and wish to remember her...
 
**Tonelico:**
Be prepared for that.
 
**Tonelico:**
As long as you possess memories of Mash, you will be someone who 'should not exist'.
 
**Tonelico:**
Your history will disappear the moment Mash is sent away from Norwich.
 
**Tonelico:**
The name of the first Fairy Knight will be lost to everyone.
 
**Tonelico:**
Do you understand? No one in the Queen's Calendar must know that you are the first Fairy Knight.
 
**Tonelico:**
If even one person recognizes you as Totrot, you will disappear from the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
You, who originated from a Lostbelt—a fantasy— cannot exist within a Singularity—a reality.
 
**Tonelico:**
That's why...I will erase all of Mash's memories of you.
 
**Tonelico:**
Memories starting from when she met you at the city of Sheffield in the year 2017 of the Queen's Calendar, to the moment she enters her coffin.
 
**Tonelico:**
If she has no knowledge of even that, you should be able to act even in the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
Do you understand? Once Mash is freed of the coffin, you mustn't interact with her under any circumstance.
 
**Tonelico:**
If she happens to remember you, you will disappear from the Queen's Calendar.
 
**Tonelico:**
Just like a Midsummer Night's Dream. When the morning lark cries, you will awaken from your dream.
 
**Mash:**
Totrot&mdash;no, Habetrot...!
 
**Mash:**
How could I have forgotten!? I'm sorry, I'm sorry...!
 
**Mash:**
But I'm happy, I'm glad! That I could see you again...
 
**Mash:**
No, you've been with me this whole time, you've been protecting me...!
 
**H：Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Well, a promise is a promise. I'll be giving this back to you, Mash.
 
**H：Fairy Knight Totrot:**
I put it inside the Spinning Wheel to hide it. You didn't notice, did you?
 
**Mash:**
The Black Barrel...! Could it be, that's why you fell so unsteadily from the sky back then!?
 
**H：Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Yep, I quickly stowed it away while Beryl Gut was busy dawdling! Aren't I amazing!?
 
**Mash:**
Yes! That was really swift of you! I didn't notice it at all either&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Habetrot...?
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
&mdash;The morning lark finally cried out. This is the end of my dream.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
I'm mostly done with the things I've been meaning to do, and my most important promise has already been fulfilled.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Habetrot will be taking her leave here. I didn't get to see the end of your journey, but I hope it'll be a happy one&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
You're in good hands, anyway! Your anniversary will surely be blessed with fine weather!
 
**Mash:**
Wait&mdash;aaa&mdash;aaa...!
 
**Mash:**
I-is it because I remembered? Is it because I remembered you, Totrot!?
 
**Mash:**
Why&mdash;why would you&mdash;you didn't have to go this far for me, I don't deserve it!
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Yes, you do. I don't really care about what you're worth or what you deserve and such things, though.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
I just want you to be happy. After all, everyone did the best they could, didn't they?
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Tonelico, Ector, Wryneck...even Grimm was a great guy.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
They're all gone now, though. We had a good journey.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Besides, I'm an ally of brides. I want you to be smiling into the future.
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Aaa&mdash;aaaaa&mdash;don't go&mdash; please don't go...!
 
**Mash:**
I take it back, I take it all back...! I won't remember you anymore, Habetrot...!
 
**Mash:**
So&mdash;please don't go&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
You...worked harder than anyone else...cried, and realized your dream...
 
**Mash:**
Even though you did all that&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Come on, don't be stupid now.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
But...let's see. In that case, don't forget about me.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
About me or Tonelico. About our journey through this beautiful Britain.
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;I won't. I won't&mdash;...!
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Well, time's up. Fujimaru's on {(M)his/(F)her} way here.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Please put Cernunnos to sleep. He looks like he's in a lot of pain.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
This is the reckoning of the dream that awaits you. A ray of light will shine through, no matter how painful the parting may be.
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Come on, cheer up!
 
**Fairy Knight Totrot:**
Show the Fairy Knight Totrot how awesome you are, Mash!
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Of course, I will! Please watch me, Totrot!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, with this Command Spell&mdash;!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I won't run anymore! As a knight who has completed her pilgrimage&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
I will use this power to annihilate the Calamity of Britain!
 
**Mash:**
Confirmed annihilation of the enemy&mdash;! Did you see that, Habetro&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
Uh...uuua...aaaa&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Thank you...so much.
 
**Mash:**
Fairy Knight Totrot. Habetrot the Seamstress.
 
**Mash:**
If I have become your dream, then there is no greater honor than this.
 
**Mash:**
Farewell...may blessings be upon you like flowers&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The sky is back to its usual twilight...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...(And now...)

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The sky is back to its usual twilight...|

---

 
**Nemo:**
Attention, Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight on deck.
 
**Nemo:**
The annihilation of the deity Cernunnos has been confirmed. The eruption of curses from the Great Pit has ceased.
 
**Nemo:**
The bottom of that seemingly bottomless pit is also observable now.
 
**Nemo:**
The Calamities that appeared in the British Lostbelt, the threats to pan-human history, have all been subdued.
 
**Nemo:**
The ship will now head for the western coast, make a water landing and resupply.
 
**Nemo:**
We will return to Novum Chaldea as soon as we confirm the British Lostbelt's safety.
 
**Nemo:**
Good work. We'll be cruising at low speed for a while, so take your time coming back.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
&mdash;Whew. We somehow did it.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I was panicking when even Rhongomyniad couldn't beat him.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
But you guys had one hell of a weapon up your sleeve! A trump card that beats Muramasa at his own god-killing game!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But...Artoria is...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Only because Habetrot took good care of it...
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Well...I suppose you're right. It was a pyrrhic victory.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
It's not common for everyone to make it out safely. There are casualties in most cases.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
This was no exception either...
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I think those two were happy, though. They did what they could to the best of their ability.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Because they believed you would win. Because they wanted to see you win, more than anyone else.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Trust...no, call it fraternity. Prioritize that over your sadness if you're going to carry this in your hearts.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Britain is not the end of your fight.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Because beyond this, the real enemy—the Alien God—awaits you.
 
**Mash:**
Yes...many thanks to the two of them. And to you too, Grimm the Wise.
 
**Mash:**
I wasn't able to ask you during the battle, but are your eyes alright!?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Yeah, it's what you'd call a mythical performance. You increase the performance of your magecraft by blinding an eye!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Grimm, your body...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see...because your role is over...
 

---

 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Looks like it.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
The role that the God of Wisdom gave me was to ensure Chaldea acquires the Holy Sword.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
As a Celtic Heroic Spirit, I was also able to see Cernunnos through to the end.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Now my battle in this Lostbelt has come to an end.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
For the record, I was able to save face as your only helper from pan-human history.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(The only one from pan-human history...)
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
?|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Thank you very much. But what happens now?
 
**Mash:**
Will Cu Chulainn be recorded as a Caster in Chaldea?
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Grimm! It's Grimm! Now that you know how it is, please call me Grimm from now on!
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
Still...I do owe you guys now. And not just me, the God of Wisdom feels the same way.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
If this Saint Graph is still allowed for me after I return to the Throne, I'll drop by your place as a Caster.
 
**Grimm the Wise:**
I'll see you then! &mdash;I have a feeling we'll meet again!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Grimm's gone too...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And now...
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Grimm's gone too...|

---

 
**Mash:**
We too will leave this Lostbelt...no, this Lostworld behind...
 
**Mash:**
The island has been devastated by the Calamity.
 
**Mash:**
There can't have been many survivors. Still, it's not as if they completely perished.
 
**Mash:**
I'd like to at least see Britain's reconstruction through before returning to Chaldea...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, let's see...hmm? The curses and flames have disappeared, but...
 
**Da Vinci:**
The discharge from the island's land hasn't stopped... no, on the contrary&mdash;
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Report, repooorrt! A gravitational shift has been confirmed all across Britain!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
The force generating gravity is no longer functioning, the ground, the land is rising&mdash;.
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Like it's going to crash down! What's happening? I don't get it, everything is falling!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Observation Lens SHEBA has detected a crisis of the highest grade!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
The cause is unknown, but at this rate, in one hour Earth will be in danger!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
It's the Collapse! The Collapse event has begun!
 
**Holmes & Da Vinci:**
...!

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's going on!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's going on!?|

---

 
**Mash:**
All the Calamities have been purged! There are no threats to Britain anymore!
 
**Mash:**
So why has the collapse begun!? There's no threat anywhere!
 
**???:**
Oh, but there is. You just did not register it as one, because it's been in plain sight from the beginning.
 
**???:**
Do you remember that mural in Londinium?
 
**???:**
That was a 'prophecy foretelling the destruction' that the priestess of Cernunnos left behind just before she was dismembered.
 
**???:**
“As the world grows anew, the roots grow tiresome. At long last, unbeknownst to all,”
 
**???:**
“from the bite of a meagre insect, shall it collapse.”
 
**???:**
It did not refer to Britain's future.
 
**???:**
If you gnaw away at the roots, this is the end result, no matter how solid human history's foundation.
 
**???:**
Everything will come to an end, including the planet.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon!?|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I knew it...so that's the score.
 
**???:**
Oh dear, did you know all along, Fujimaru?
 
**???:**
I'll be damned. Now you're making me feel embarrassed for trying to time this right, but...
 
**???:**
Well, so what? I wasn't hiding it from you in the first place.
 
**???:**
Because among all the insignificant pawns, you stood out as the least significant of all.
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon!?|
 

---

 
**???:**
Hmm? What happened to you, Blanca? That wonderful antenna of yours isn't twitching at all.
 
**???:**
Oh, so you died. Perhaps from the Mors' black stain...
 
**???:**
Did you catch all the poison of Britain directed my way in my stead?
 
**???:**
Thank you. I don't really care, though.
 
**Holmes:**
&mdash;Oberon. Is that Oberon?
 
**Holmes:**
He does feel like a Fairy King...what's going on here, Da Vinci?
 
**Holmes:**
According to your report, Oberon was a local ally... a Servant of pan-human history summoned to this land.
 
**Holmes:**
But his Saint Graph is not that of pan-human history.
 
**Holmes:**
No, he's neither human nor fairy. There is no category of life form he falls under!
 
**Holmes:**
Is that&mdash;really the Fairy King Oberon?
 
**Da Vinci:**
It is, I've already confirmed it many times over&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
...!? The Border's radar cannot pick up his magical signature!? No, it can pick it up, but...
 
**Da Vinci:**
The data isn't matching at all! His Saint Graph is fluctuating by the second!
 
**Da Vinci:**
The information on his Saint Graph has no credibility at all!
 
**Da Vinci:**
At this rate, he's no different from an invisible man who's both there and not there at once!
 
**Mash:**
T-then who on earth is that person?
 
**???:**
&mdash;
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Ah! A massive otherworldly space has been confirmed in northern Britain! No way, no way, when did this even appear!?
 
**Holmes:**
Excuse me, but otherworldly space doesn't cut it! I need more details!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Umm, umm, well, something strange is there! Are those...living...beings?
 
**Nemo Marine:**
It's inexplicable. I repeat, we cannot explain it!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
I've never seen a creature like that before anywhere on this planet!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
I've tried using sonar but there's no reactioooon~ (cries)!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
This is bad, SHEBA's pitch black! I don't believe it, but we're done for!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
“Return voyage impossible”, “perpetual state of non-arrival”, “currently on an endless voyage”. What's with these status reports!?
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Captain, I'm scared, this is scary! Have we been sunk!?
 
**Holmes:**
Indeed, there is something that can only be described as a hole in space flowing over northern Britain...
 
**Holmes:**
Can't you see it on the monitor?
 
**Holmes:**
{(M)Mister/(F)Miss} Fujimaru! Can you confirm it from the deck!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's been visible for a while now...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Master, what is that?
 
**Mash:**
Something like a black mist that's sucking up the ground...no, devouring the island.
 
**Mash:**
What&mdash;what exactly is that horrifying creature...!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's probably&mdash;|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;an insect.|
 

---

 
**???:**
That's right. It's an insect.
 
**???:**
Of course, as you can see, it's a conceptual insect. An infinite hole which will consume Britain and this planet from the inside out.
 
**???:**
Well, you can think of it as an endless void.
 
**???:**
Oh, and it is also me.
 
**???:**
I don't know which is the main body and which is the shadow, though.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who&mdash;are you!?|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Tell us your real name, Oberon.
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who&mdash;are you!?|
 

---

 
**???:**
&mdash;Very well. Since it's a request from you of all people, I'll answer.
 
**Mash:**
Senpai...Oberon's form is...no, his very Saint Graph itself is&mdash;
 
**???:**
My word, these fairies are truly incorrigible.
 
**???:**
They killed a god above the land they lost due to their own negligence, and built a small island.
 
**???:**
But not satisfied with just that, they reclaimed the sea with corpses and made land.
 
**???:**
The audacity of that and their disgusting way of life makes you want to puke. Doesn't it, Fujimaru?
 
**???:**
Even a human like you would find it questionable.
 
**???:**
From the perspective of the original British Island, which was lost, it is hopelessly sickening.
 
**???:**
To the point where it wants to be wiped out, even if it means spreading the Calamities around.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon&mdash;|
 

---

 
**???:**
But Cernunnos wasn't like that. He was a guardian of the fairies.
 
**???:**
Unless he disappeared, I wouldn't be able to surface.
 
**???:**
Morgan made sealing Cernunnos, rather than defeating him, a precondition of the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**???:**
That was a quandary, really. I had no way of defeating Morgan.
 
**???:**
And so, I waited for a someone who could.
 
**???:**
For someone who could remove the lid on Cernunnos, and defeat him.
 
**???:**
The foretelling of the Child of Prophecy was a godsend. To the point I thought things were getting interesting.
 
**???:**
That's why I even lent a hand.
 
**???:**
So that the Child of Prophecy would set out on her journey. So that the pilgrimage would be successful.
 
**???:**
&mdash;So that, by your hands, everything would be rendered meaningless.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Say your name, Oberon!|
 

---

 
**???:**
Fine.
 
**???:**
I am a fantasy born of your pan-human history, one who took the form of the Fairy King Oberon.
 
**???:**
The embodiment of the will of Britain, which yearned for its own destruction alongside the end of the Age of Mystery.
 
**???:**
&mdash;The name is Vortigern.
 
**???:**
Oberon-Vortigern.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
The Insect of the Abyss come to destroy the Fairy Kingdom of Britain alongside you.
 
## Section 30: A Midsummer Night's Dream 
 
**Narration:**
Britain is collapsing.
 
**Narration:**
Buildings made in imitation of human civilization.
 
**Narration:**
Corpses from the distant past. Corpses that lost their lives to the Calamity currently present.
 
**Narration:**
With each passing moment they ascend and are devoured by the insect.
 
**Narration:**
The land in the north melts like snow. The land in the south is swept away like ashes.
 
**Narration:**
Those who barely managed to survive held hands as they fell.
 
**Narration:**
As though it had all been a fleeting dream from the beginning.
 
**Nemo Marine:**
I can't narrow down that mysterious Servant's Saint Graph pattern (cries)!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
It doesn't fall under any of the seven classes a Saint Graph is normally applicable for, nor does it fall under the extra classes!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
I've never seen this kind of class before! What on earth is it, Hoooolmes!?
 
**Holmes:**
All I can say is that it's a hitherto unknown class...
 
**Holmes:**
Righteous 'heroes' are revered by the masses, great beings who were paragons of their time.
 
**Holmes:**
And 'anti-heroes' serve as counterparts to those heroes...obstacles necessary for the achievement of good.
 
**Holmes:**
Among them, there are those who lie&mdash;those who deceive others, achieving great acts through those lies.
 
**Holmes:**
A forgery and fake—no, 'someone' who gained more power and left behind feats and achievements greater than the real deal by deceiving even their own souls.
 
**Holmes:**
Not one who avenges, nor one who arbitrates. Not one from outside the domain, nor a distinct, detached personality.
 
**Holmes:**
&mdash;One who acts out a role—a Pretender. A fabricated Heroic Spirit whose enemy is neither man nor beast, but rather, the world itself.
 
**Holmes:**
Truly befitting the name Oberon...!
 
**Gordolf:**
D-d-don't&mdash;
 
**Gordolf:**
Don't be ridiculous, what's the meaning of this!?
 
**Gordolf:**
The {(M)boy/(F)girl} won. Kyrielight did it!
 
**Gordolf:**
We may be at odds with the Lostbelt&mdash;
 
**Gordolf:**
But, it's not like we want to destroy them either! We saved Britain!
 
**Gordolf:**
So why is this happening!?
 
**Gordolf:**
Answer me, Holmes! What in blazes is that monster!?
 
**Holmes:**
&mdash;In all likelihood, that is the concept of a void.
 
**Holmes:**
It may appear to be a living organism, but it lacks muscles, bones, and digestive organs.
 
**Holmes:**
Neither is that its mouth, as much as it is a 'hole'.
 
**Holmes:**
It may appear as though the earth is being sucked up, but in truth, it's 'falling in'.
 
**Holmes:**
Imagine, if you will, a bathtub full of water. Our world is the water in that bathtub.
 
**Holmes:**
That thing is the bathtub's 'stopper'. Now. what happens to the water once that stopper is removed?
 
**Gordolf:**
I mean, it's water, so it'll circle the drain and flow down the drainpipe...
 
**Gordolf:**
So...in other words, that thing isn't sucking anything up...
 
**Holmes:**
Yes. We are—no, space itself is falling towards that thing.
 
**Holmes:**
It would be pointless even if we managed to escape this place.
 
**Holmes:**
Now that the 'stopper' is removed, everything on the planet will fall down that 'hole'.
 
**Holmes:**
A 'pitfall' in the truest sense of the word.
 
**Holmes:**
I did not quite expect a 'hole' that swallows up the world itself.
 
**Mash:**
Vortigern...the vile king who killed Uther, the father of King Arthur...
 
**Mash:**
In other words&mdash;the enemy of King Arthur from this Lostbelt...!
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Not really, though. I couldn't care less about King Arthur.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
You need to think on a bigger scale, Mash. I am humanity's enemy.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Even in your world, Vortigern was the very fate of Britain, wasn't he?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Refusing to acknowledge the Age of Man,
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
wanting to end Britain while it was still in the Age of Mystery, before humans could trample on it.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Suicidal ideation, in other words.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Yes, I get it. I get it!
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
The spotlight going to that which you hate is just adding insult to injury!
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Well, it's all over once King Arthur defeats you, though.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
In pan-human history, good and evil are both as naïve.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
To destroy humanity is to destroy the planet.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
That Vortigern kicked the bucket because he couldn't bring himself to do that.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why? Why are you trying to destroy humanity?|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Because they disgust me.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I don't have any other reason. What of it?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
You would feel disgust too if you found vermin in the corner of your room, wouldn't you?
 
**Mash:**
This Britain...disgusts you? You say this Fairy Kingdom where fairies and humans live is disgusting...!?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Huh. You liked it, Mash? That's amazing. You have poor taste.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Still, I'm disgusted by just about everything I lay eyes on, though.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
It's not just the Fairy Kingdom. Your world looks like a shithole to me.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Oops...sorry about that, I slipped in some foul language there. I'd rather not use words unbecoming of a Fairy King.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I'll be more careful next time, so please let that one slide. You will, won't you? After all, it's just between us.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I'll even apologize for everything I've said so far if you want.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
If it displeases you, we can pretend this conversation never happened.
 
**Mash:**
Umm&mdash;Y-yes. U-umm...what?
 
**Mash:**
Master...just now, I felt pure trustworthiness from Oberon...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stop deceiving Mash...|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
How do you mean?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're full of lies.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Because you're Oberon, the Great Liar.
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're full of lies.|

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
&mdash;That's the spirit. I'm glad, Fujimaru.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I am indeed a liar. I've never once spoken the truth, I swear it!
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
But I was truly serious! I seriously endeavoured to destroy Britain.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
And above all else&mdash;I was counting on you the most.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
To that end, normally you'd be at a loss if someone told you to destroy Britain, wouldn't you?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Truth be told, that was the case for me too. Good grief.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Furthermore, if you think about it carefully, it wasn't as simple as just defeating Morgan.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
The destruction of the Fairy Kingdom required a variety of factors. I needed a variety of desires.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
It wasn't as simple as just having Morgan and Chaldea settle things.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I needed everything. And I only got one shot at it.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I couldn't afford to be careless with this. But&mdash;
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
When I saw you on that beach, I had a feeling.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
That this kid is a real moron. The best {(M)actor/(F)actress} I could imagine. {(M)He/(F)She} will surely live up to my expectations!
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
{(M)He/(F)She} will take care of everything once and for all as the worst, yet best audience. I believed that from the bottom of my heart!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gee, thanks...|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Am I supposed to be an actor or the audience?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Sorry, let me correct myself. You're an annoying critic. Are you happy now?
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Well&mdash;in any case, you've more than lived up to my expectations.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
So I would've been fine with letting you go&mdash;
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
But, I'd better get rid of Chaldea.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Vortigern's purpose is to destroy the false Britain that merrily continued existing even after his death, but...
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
My purpose is to eradicate your human history.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Chaldea's role is to protect pan-human history, isn't it? Then that makes us enemies.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I'll take care of you here. It'll be a bother if I get the tables turned on me later.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;The Abyssal Insect is falling towards us&mdash;|
 

---

 
**Meunière:**
What's going on? We can't shake it no matter how fast we go!
 
**Meunière:**
Captain! Da Vinci! Holmes! Even the old man will do at this point!
 
**Meunière:**
Get those two on the deck back inside the ship! No, they won't make it&mdash;!
 
**Meunière:**
The Collapse is approaching from right above the Storm Border! We can't evade, we'll get swallowed up...!
 
**Meunière:**
All our instruments have stopped functioning. We can't monitor the situation on the outside either!
 
**Meunière:**
I mean, it's pitch black! There's no sound or light!
 
**Meunière:**
What do we do, Captain? This is a hopeless&mdash;
 
**Nemo:**
Fix gravity values on the deck floor, raise the bow vertically, and keep the engine going steady at its second stage!
 
**Nemo:**
If we're falling, all we have to do is climb!
 
**Nemo:**
Even if we're in pitch black darkness, even if this is an endless void&mdash;
 
**Nemo:**
We're not giving up until the engines die! All hands, maintain battle positions!
 
**Nemo:**
Fujimaru and Mash are outside, along with the enemy life form responsible for the Collapse!
 
**Nemo:**
We're definitely&mdash;
 
**Nemo:**
We're definitely going to find a way out!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
When he was born, he could not even draw breath.
 
**Narration:**
There was not a single inch of his body that felt at ease.
 
**Narration:**
He was no more than a fluid inside a festering chrysalis.
 
**Narration:**
Under those circumstances,
 
**Narration:**
can you understand how it felt upon awakening under the light of dawn?
 
**Narration:**
In the autumn forest on the outskirts of the Fairy Kingdom.
 
**Narration:**
Fairies without a place to call their own, fairies who escaped abuse and suffered persecution gather...
 
**Narration:**
They all gathered in that autumn forest and were left with no choice but to die.
 
**Narration:**
Those who had nowhere left to go.
 
**Narration:**
Those who had no choice but to perish, hated and forgotten by all.
 
**Narration:**
In the midst of all that, a chrysalis emerged.
 
**Narration:**
The chrysalis looked identical to a fairy, although it was not one. In truth, it was a doomsday device birthed by Britain itself.
 
**Narration:**
“It's disgusting how a history that's long since dead has clung to life for over 10,000 years!”
 
**Narration:**
“I want to erase every last trace of this island, along with everything that lives on it!”
 
**Narration:**
He was little more than an insect birthed out of 'disgust towards living creatures', spewed forth by the island.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
&mdash;aaa&mdash;aaaaa&mdash;aaaaaaa&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
However, the birth of a maggot, spawned out of such excreta, was a miserable one.
 
**Narration:**
The chrysalis was a pitiful yet beautiful sight to behold. As such, they must have come to believe he was their king.
 
**Narration:**
The fairies of the autumn forest gathered around the chrysalis, and stood vigil around it until the chrysalis was able to stand on its own.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Aaa&mdash;haaaaa, that felt disgusting.
 
**Narration:**
By the time it stood up, that thing was no longer a chrysalis.
 
**Narration:**
The ideal king of fairy tales that the fairies of the autumn forest had been awaiting.
 
**Narration:**
It was born in the form of a Fairy King, one written by a famous, genius writer with a bit of a mean streak.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
First it was the Mors King, and now this?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Heh, so this is a Ghost Liner...what they call a Servant, huh?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
So as long as it's something born from the desires of people, it makes no difference whether the form is based on truth or a fabrication.
 
**Narration:**
The fairy known as Oberon existed in both pan-human history and this Fairyland Britain alike.
 
**Narration:**
But the 'Oberon' who the king became was a great liar, made up only of lies.
 
**Narration:**
A story 'with no truth to it whatsoever' told with the preamble that 'it was all a single night's lunacy'.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Amazing. Everything I say, everything I do, eventually becomes warped.
 
**Narration:**
I love you' means 'I don't love you'. 'I don't love you' means 'I don't even like you'.
 
**Narration:**
That is Oberon's idiosyncrasy.
 
**Narration:**
As that is how he is as a Heroic Spirit, even he himself cannot circumvent it.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Hmph, very well, not that it matters. I was planning on deceiving everyone anyway.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Still...this is just because you have flotsam drifting ashore to Britain.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Morgan loves pan-human history a tad too much, doesn't she? So much for her claims of hating it.
 
**Narration:**
Thus, the Fairy King was born.
 
**Narration:**
That was the fateful year when the song of the 'Child of Prophecy' caught the attention of the world.
 
**Narration:**
The king knew about pan-human history, to an extent. However, he was thorough in his research this time.
 
**Narration:**
The story of King Arthur, the archenemy of Morgan.
 
**Narration:**
All so that he could manipulate the Fairy of Paradise, who had appeared somewhere in Britain.
 
**Narration:**
When I was born, I could not even draw breath.
 
**Narration:**
There was not a single inch of my body that felt at ease.
 
**Narration:**
I was little more than a fluid inside a festering chrysalis.
 
**Narration:**
Under those circumstances...
 
**Narration:**
The sea of insects, writhing like garbage, was the entire world that unfolded before me.
 
**Narration:**
Oberon was born from Britain's death throes.
 
**Narration:**
He harbored no love for the creatures that live on the island.
 
**Narration:**
In the first place, even the heavy burden of destroying the Fairy Kingdom, as willed by the island,
 
**Narration:**
was something that depressed him. He asked himself, “do I really have to do that?”.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
That said...now that I'm born, I have no choice but to go through with it.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Oh, I still can't move my body...
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I feel like even taking a breath could kill me.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I feel like I would pass out just from moving my fingertips.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
And, above all else&mdash;
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Just being alive makes me want to puke.
 
**Narration:**
Oberon, as a chrysalis, did not have the ability to close his eyes.
 
**Narration:**
As such, he could not avert his eyes from them.
 
**Narration:**
Swarming. Swarming.
 
**Narration:**
Swarming. For half a year, Oberon continued to stare at them.
 
**Narration:**
Oberon was born of muddy filth.
 
**Narration:**
Even the inside of the chrysalis was filled with muddy fluids.
 
**Narration:**
The scenery that unfolded before his eyes was likewise a muddy one.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
The sight of weaklings, going with the flow, clinging to hope without any prospects, was a disgusting one.
 
**Narration:**
Being depended on by weaklings who had withered away after continuously falling victim to the deceptions of others, felt disgusting.
 
**Narration:**
It felt disgusting to be crowned king by creatures that could only writhe and swarm around.
 
**Narration:**
And above all else, he was disgusted at himself, the lowest of the low—the one they flocked to.
 
**Narration:**
Just like the corpse of a butterfly being swarmed by ants. The lowest of the low, taking its place at the bottom of a garbage dump.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
The hatred and repulsion that arose in his heart was not directed at anyone in particular.
 
**Narration:**
Not at the insects that had gathered, nor towards himself, the one being swarmed.
 
**Narration:**
What Oberon felt was unnecessary was the 'structure of the world' itself that included all of those.
 
**Narration:**
In any case, leaving his story aside for the moment.
 
**Narration:**
Get ahold of yourself, Fujimaru. A little longer, just a little longer now.
 
**Narration:**
You're going to show me an amazing comeback at the very end, aren't you?

**Fujimaru 1:**
That star...|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Hmm? You're still alive? That's strange, we're in the abyss.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Have you by any chance overcome your 'dejections'?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
If so, your awakening would make sense. Although, I think it'll make for a more painful death.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where am I?|
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
On the deck of your ship. You were swallowed whole by the Abyssal Insect.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where's Mash!?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Mash is fast asleep right next to you. Though not in form, because she hasn't woken up.
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
But now that you have woken up, why don't we have a little chat?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I've just finished taking a walk around inside your ship. I found some food inside, you see.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I'm talking about those portable meals. You're tired, aren't you? Have some.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
You look like you want to ask why I'm being so courteous...it's written all over your face. Well, I'm not being courteous.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I took a walk in your ship while going around killing your comrades,
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I even went and killed Mash first. And you'll die soon enough too.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Right now, you're all falling down an endless void. The body of the Abyssal Insect is infinite.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
That which is swallowed by it will continue to fall endlessly. Without a destination. For eternity.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
It's infinite, so once you're swallowed, there are no 'entrances' or 'exits'. It's the end.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
No matter how strong the life form may be, no matter how superior they may be, they will never escape this void.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Unless they kill me.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
But there's no one awake here. Everyone's in the midst of a 'falling dream'.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
If they wake up, they will appear like you did. However, most people just keep falling.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I think they're happier that way, though. It'd just be hell for them if they were awake.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
In this darkness, you keep falling even after you die. It's horrible to think about, isn't it?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;In other words, help isn't coming?|
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Of course not. Would you like to try?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That would mean you're in hell too, Oberon...
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
That's right. But now that the Abyssal Insect has been formed, the world will perish on its own.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
It doesn't matter whether I'm in here or out there. Besides, I've been in hell from the start.
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Either way, there's nothing you can do. You can't even perform a simple summoning here.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
After all, this is a void that human history has never witnessed. Not a single Heroic Spirit is recorded here.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
You can't summon what isn't there.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Will you go mad, unable to endure the endless fall here?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Or will you close your eyes and dream of falling, like the others?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Choose whichever one you want. If you ever feel like sleeping, please give me a shout.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Of course, if you want to save the world, you don't have time to be thinking it over.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
The Lostworld Britain is no more. We're in a normal flow of time now.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Chaldea observed the end of the world in 24 hours, did it not?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
That's exactly right. There won't even be a single minute of a grace period.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
If you want to save the world, then fight me and you'll be killed. That in itself isn't such a good death either, is it?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Yeah.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're exactly right!
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Wow, you really took a swing at me. You're very easily provoked, aren't you?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Well, if you want to die, I'll be happy to oblige. Fighting with no chance of victory can also be fun!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;There is a chance of victory.|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Huh? How, exactly?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;It will be here soon.|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Like I said, help isn't&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
After all, we are bystanders, aren't we?|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come, Caster!!!!|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
&mdash;!
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
You're&mdash;you're...!
 
**Artoria:**
I have come in response to the Foreign Magus' summons, in accordance with our contract.
 
**Artoria:**
If it is a battle to save the world, and not to admonish Britain.
 
**Artoria:**
Then even at the end of time, this sword will be within {(M)his/(F)her} hands.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Narration:**
You hear the tolling of a bell. Not the bell of obligation you have heard countless times before.
 
**Narration:**
But the nostalgic toll of a bell that believes in and beckons you.
 
**Narration:**
You have always been running amidst this storm. This maelstrom of malevolence. This crucible of truth.
 
**Narration:**
Amidst cold, dark and deafening voices that are no different from sewage.
 
**Immature Self:**
No, no, no, no&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
You have lost count of how many times you had given up, of how many times you wished for death.
 
**Narration:**
The reason you were able to keep on going, without hesitation...
 
**Narration:**
It was because you had that light. That distant, small, blue star shining in solitude beyond the storm.
 
**Immature Self:**
Haa, haa, haa, haa&mdash;!
 
**Narration:**
Whenever you fell, you would stand up crying. Whenever you were tired, you would boldly hold your head high.
 
**Narration:**
That star always shone bright in the distance.
 
**Narration:**
“A handful of good intentions amidst the malice.”
 
**Narration:**
“A bright future that would be bestowed upon you one day.”
 
**Immature Self:**
No way. There's no way that'll happen. No, I couldn't care less about that.
 
**Narration:**
For you, that star is nothing more than a light shining bright.
 
**Narration:**
That alone was enough to make it your goal.
 
**Narration:**
The fact that somewhere out there, someone else is also gazing at that star.
 
**Narration:**
That was your only hope. Through any and all storms, that fact alone never changed.
 
**Immature Self:**
Yes&mdash;that's right. That was all I had.
 
**Immature Self:**
I was afraid of a great many things. I couldn't believe in a great many things.
 
**Narration:**
But the light of that star was always there to cheer you up.
 
**Narration:**
That star has nothing to do with you whatsoever.
 
**Narration:**
That star will never turn your way, nor will it ever come down for your sake.
 
**Immature Self:**
Yes...I couldn't care less about Britain, I couldn't care less about the future.
 
**Immature Self:**
But as long as that star continues to shine.
 
**Narration:**
No matter what storm sweeps across the world of man. Even if the suffering outweighs the reward.
 
**Narration:**
That light which has always kept watch over you since you were but a child.
 
**Narration:**
That lone light that shone amidst the storm.
 
**Narration:**
Not for the sake of society, not for the sake of peace, not for your sake.
 
**Immature Self:**
I don't want to betray the light of that little star that always shone bright.
 
**Disappointment in You:**
Oh&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
However, there is nothing past this point.
 
**Narration:**
Embracing the sound of that bell. Ending your journey.
 
**Narration:**
There is no life for you beyond this. Just as she, in her chalk white castle, never found happiness.
 
**Narration:**
If you, the one who chants the name of the king, go any further, you will disappear. You will no longer be needed.
 
**Narration:**
Can you do it? For the sake of that small, lone star?
 
**Narration:**
Can you say simply say “I don't want to betray that beautiful star”,
 
**Narration:**
for a reason as meaningless, insignificant, and trivial as that?
 
**Disappointment in You:**
Hiii&mdash;aaaaa, guh, aaaaa&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
A voice curses me, the one who ended Britain. A voice resents me, the one who fulfilled the duty of Paradise.
 
**Narration:**
Tens of thousands of complaints. Hundreds of millions of voices accusing me.
 
**Narration:**
This is simply the face of malice. In reality, there is no star shining amidst the storm.
 
**Narration:**
With a reason like that, I could not possibly save someone other than myself.
 
**Disappointment in You:**
Haa&mdash;aaa&mdash;aaa...aaa&mdash;aaa?
 
**Disappointment in You:**
Who...? Someone is shielding me&mdash;
 
**Disappointment in You:**
No, they're not shielding me at all. They're desperately reaching out a hand to me&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
Someone who lost their life at your whim.
 
**Narration:**
Someone from the furthest end, no different from you, that you have long since forgotten.
 
**Narration:**
Her name was...
 
**D：Mash:**
I understand. Not having a name must be miserable.
 
**D：Mash:**
Then, how about something like this? Really, it's just an idea I had just now...
 
**D：Mash:**
Please use my name. Artoria Caster.
 
**D：Mash:**
Either Artoria, or Caster. Whichever you prefer!
 
**D：Mash:**
Hmph, it's not like I'll be using it anymore. Feel free to call yourself that!
 
**Fairy Girl:**
&mdash;Thank you. I'll cherish&mdash;I'll cherish it.
 
**Fairy Girl:**
Not just this name, but also your heart. Forever and ever.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;aaaaa&mdash;aaa&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
Her name was Hope, one who found the light of the star at the very end.
 
**Narration:**
One who had grown tired of her role, that of giving hope to everyone, and lamented. Yet she did not lose her smile.
 
**Narration:**
She protected me all this time, over a mere random act.
 
**Narration:**
She believed in me, even now, over something as insignificant as that.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;It wasn't anything special or noble.
 
**Narration:**
And it may seem like a trivial reason for others.
 
**Artoria:**
No...thank you for cherishing it.
 
**Narration:**
That's right, I never had some exemplary reason either.
 
**Narration:**
I'm no different from her.
 
**Narration:**
I have nothing I can be proud of, even the talent I was praised for is surely just for show.
 
**Narration:**
Surely, I will never find a reason that everyone will be envious of me.
 
**Narration:**
But...yes, but&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
What about it? I'm fine with that.
 
**Narration:**
I just don't want to betray that star. I just don't want to discard this feeling.
 
**Narration:**
For such an insignificant reason, we...you&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Always! I always have to do my best...!
 
**Narration:**
Even if it's false courage, even if it's just self-complacency. Even if I lack confidence to the very end, not knowing the answer.
 
**Narration:**
Even if it appears to be a meaningless, insignificant reason to others.
 
**Narration:**
I believe in that alone. I can only believe in that.
 
**Narration:**
That alone keeps me running, even now.
 
**Narration:**
Goodbye, dear child. Now, from now on, forevermore.
 
**Narration:**
The pulse of the star within your heart. The tolling of the bell will, in time, resonate within you.
 
**Artoria:**
I have come in response to the Foreign Magus' summons, in accordance with our contract.
 
**Artoria:**
If it is a battle to save the world, and not to admonish Britain.
 
**Artoria:**
Then even at the end of time, this sword will be within {(M)his/(F)her} hands.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
&mdash;You've got to be kidding me. No, I suppose this is what I told you to become.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
But the Fairy of Paradise becoming a Heroic Spirit? Now that's a surprise. How kingly can you even get?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Still though, isn't this a bit indecorous of you? You've already left the stage, haven't you?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I don't know if this is your future self or a guardian categorized as such, but Britain has perished.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
You've lost. Your time in the spotlight has long since passed.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
An actor who has departed the stage, lacking in strength, has no business coming back.
 
**Artoria:**
I suppose you're right...that which I protect is no longer here.
 
**Artoria:**
However&mdash;Fairy King Oberon. The one who desired the end of Britain.
 
**Artoria:**
It is indeed unsightly to see that which is dead continue to cling to life.
 
**Artoria:**
Your act of ending it was a righteous one.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I know, right?
 
**Artoria:**
But I cannot allow you to propagate this elsewhere.
 
**Artoria:**
Even if the fairies are beyond salvation, even if there is no longer any hope in our future,
 
**Artoria:**
it is wrong to rob the present of those who still have a future.
 
**Artoria:**
It is more unsightly than staving off destruction.
 
**Artoria:**
Isn't that right, Oberon? Your actions are well and truly disgraceful.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(She fired back twofold...!)|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(This Artoria's super harsh...!)
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Guh&mdash;where am...my body is&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Oh dear, what a surprise.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank goodness, you woke up!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes, I was in an inexpressible, endlessly falling dream&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Wait, Senpai? Artoria!?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Even Mash woke up. Ah, so it's your doing, Artoria.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Then I suppose even the ones on the bridge are awake. How bothersome.
 
**Artoria:**
Mash, Fujimaru will explain later.
 
**Artoria:**
Right now, I need your strength.
 
**Artoria:**
We will destroy the source of the Abyssal Insect here, before it can propagate beyond Britain.
 
**Mash:**
Roger! Please leave it to me!
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
As usual, you change gears quickly. Still, it doesn't matter.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
After all, Chaldea's motto is to always defeat the enemy, isn't it? Very well, I'll play along.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I was just about tired of talking anyway. I've fully explained who I am.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
In terms of theatre, this is the climax. Though the fly in the ointment would be that we lack an audience.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Well, it is a third-rate performance, so I suppose a squalid theatre is fitting.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Very well, bring them out, Fujimaru. Now's the time to summon away to your heart's content.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Go ahead and raise the curtain on the fight to protect the Human Order with that self-satisfied look of yours!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bring it on!|
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll ask again one last time...
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bring it on!|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Hah? What is it?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What are you after?|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Oh, I just want to wipe the slate clean.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I've already spoken plenty about it, have I not? That I found both humans and fairies equally and hopelessly disgusting.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
That's why I'll get rid of them all. That's why I used you.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Were you perhaps thinking that it was a fun journey? My condolences, if so.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Everything I say is a lie. Not worth a mite of trust.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I couldn't care less about Britain's peace, Artoria's mission, or just about anything else.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That may be true...|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But what about that shining star, Titania?|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Oh, I really hate it when you do that.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
The calamity of collapse. The remains of twilight. They are all but a midsummer night's dream.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I am Oberon. Oberon Vortigern.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
A Threat to Humanity who will always oppose you, no matter what. A doomsday device of deception.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Unlike the Beasts, I will never harbor any love. This battle shall prove that.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Now, let the curtain rise on this tragedy! The pilgrimage ends here!
 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Oberon Vortigern:**
Hey everyone, I'm back. Did you manage to somehow survive another day?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Oh, you all burned to death? I see. A fitting ending. It would've happened sooner or later!
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Then let's leave the story about the outsiders for another time. To be honest, I don't have anything to talk about anyway.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Oh dear, you're&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey there.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sorry, did I doze off for a bit there?
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
&mdash;Are you serious? Just how impudent are you, you {(M)bastard/(F)bitch}?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Oops, no swearing here. No swearing.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Is my mind playing tricks on me? Did you really fall asleep in the middle of a battle?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
No matter. Either way, this is a dream. Why don't we have some tea one last time?
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Though I have nothing left to say. I've said all that can be said about my goal, my character, and my story.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I don't think there's any reason for you to be here any longer.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's still something you haven't told me.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If this is it, at least tell me how you really feel.
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Huh? Is your brain rotten? Even worse than mine? Is your memory worse than that of an insect?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I mean, you are a liar, Oberon.|
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
&mdash;Exactly. If you point that out, then it's my loss.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Sure, I do have my own true feelings. Yes. Quite a bit.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Vortigern was Britain's fate and I was born as his alter ego, but...
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
You see, at the same time, I'm also Oberon.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Didn't we talk about this before? About what the Fairy Kingdom is.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
You see, this whole place is a fairy tale. It's all one big story.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
A 14,000 year old picture book crafted by Morgan, who had no place besides a fictional history to call her own.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
As usual, you lot denied it. Called it wrong. Called it meaningless.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I hated that. I was beside myself with disgust.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
After envisioning a convenient existence, a story everyone dreams of.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Even after having your lives changed by that story.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
You trample on it and mock it because it's a 'fantasy that does not exist in reality'. You people disgust me.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Is that&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Resentment towards the story...?
 

---

 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Yes. No matter how hackneyed the kingdom may be, the unsung side characters still have meaning.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Even a story that will be forgotten once its last page has been turned, left behind by the speed of reality&mdash;
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
It should have the right to continue existing.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Well, there's no point in telling this to a human like you. You'll just end up forgetting once something new comes up, anyway.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Growth and renewal, are these not the tenets of pan-human history? There is no eternity. It will go on forever.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I find that tiresome.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I was just pissed off at it all, I wanted it all to end.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Are you satisfied now? Then time to wake up.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Neither the morning lark nor the curtain of night have a need of you yet.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Cheers, you Chaldean bastard! It was a dull journey, but one full of twists!
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Good luck with the next one! I will pray for your good fortune from the bottom of my heart!

**B：Oberon Vortigern:**
Aaaaaaaaaaaa!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oberon&mdash;!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
The enemy Servant has fallen from the deck &mdash;down towards the void...!
 
**Artoria:**
Severe damage has been confirmed on Oberon Vortigern's spiritual core.
 
**Artoria:**
For the Insect of the Abyss—for Vortigern, the Holy Sword is both food and poison, a double-edged sword.
 
**Artoria:**
He'll never crawl back up again, not with that wound.
 
**Artoria:**
He will continue to fall for all eternity, down towards that nonexistent abyss.
 
**Mash:**
Down the pit, for all eternity&mdash;that's&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, this is fine...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's fine...
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Oops, I don't have time to be savoring the aftertaste either.
 
**Artoria:**
Just like that, the time has come for me to leave.
 
**Artoria:**
Well, it's only expected seeing how I came here of my own will, similar to the Merlin of pan-human history.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see. (So you came here on foot)|
 
**Artoria:**
I didn't walk here. More like I transcended space and time and swung by.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah...thank you.
 
**Artoria:**
&mdash;It's my pleasure. I heard your voice, you see.
 
**Artoria:**
I hope I've been useful to you.
 

---

 
**Nemo:**
Storm Border bridge to Fujimaru, do you copy?
 
**Nemo:**
I have not been able to confirm the facts, but I have a grasp on the situation at hand!
 
**Nemo:**
Just now, the collapse of this conceptual space... no, its occlusion process has been confirmed!
 
**Nemo:**
Right now, the abyssal hole is losing all connection to the outside world!
 
**Nemo:**
If we can't escape before the occlusion process is complete, we will also continue to fall eternally.
 
**Nemo:**
As such, we will be performing a full speed vertical takeoff&mdash;and head for the sky!
 
**Nemo:**
Fujimaru, Mash Kyrielight, take shelter in the Border immediately!
 
**Mash:**
We have our instructions, Master! Umm...what should we do!?
 
**Artoria:**
Please evacuate, don't mind me. I've already said my goodbyes.
 
**Artoria:**
The girl who travelled with the two of you, Artoria Caster.
 
**Artoria:**
Her existence is unique to this Lostbelt. She will return to the Inner Sea of the Planet, along with the shadow of Paradise.
 
**Artoria:**
However&mdash;
 
**Artoria:**
Her actions and the answers she found are engraved in me.
 
**Artoria:**
I am not King Arthur, but rather the keeper of the Holy Sword&mdash;the conceptual manifestation of the 'Knight of the Holy Sword'.
 
**Artoria:**
Only those chosen by the Holy Sword—only those who wield it—shall be entrusted with it.
 
**Artoria:**
So think of this as a special service. Just because of a precious contract I couldn't break.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;It's a one-off thing, after all.|
 

---

 
**Artoria:**
Yes. Just as you wished for it, that other 'me' also wished to be your strength.
 
**Artoria:**
Please hurry, you mustn't get caught up in the Abyssal Insect's collapse.
 
**Artoria:**
Goodbye, Fujimaru, Mash.
 
**Artoria:**
Go without fear, for the light of the stargazers of Chaldea illuminates the path you walk.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Goodbye, my dear friend from Britain.|
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Goodbye to the ordinary girl who was my kindred spirit...|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Senpai...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come on, let's go!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Fujimaru and Mash are confirmed to be onboard! Captain, hit it!
 
**Nemo:**
Alright! Commence parallel operation of all four Triton Engines!
 
**Nemo:**
Target speed, 10,000 km/h! Storm Border, advance towards the mouth of the void!
 
**Nemo:**
Professor, how long until the occlusion process completes!? Can we make it at this speed!?
 
**Nemo Professor:**
Report coming up~. It will take an estimated five minutes for complete occlusion of the Abyssal Hole to occur.
 
**Nemo Professor:**
On the other hand, the computer room was down for twenty minutes, so assuming our ship has fallen further during that window,
 
**Nemo Professor:**
calculations indicate we have fallen roughly 420 km.
 
**Nemo Professor:**
Even taking accelerations and decelerations into account, we should be able to make it out with time to spare if we go at Mach 8.5!
 
**Da Vinci:**
No wait, there's no point in calculating our time falling to the distance of the exit!
 
**Da Vinci:**
This pit is infinite! There are no exits or entrances once you're in!
 
**Da Vinci:**
No matter how fast we go, we won't reach the entrance we fell in from!
 
**Holmes:**
Which means we'll need to 'make' an exit...!
 
**Holmes:**
Captain, do you think you can make a hole in the side with the Storm Border's shelling?
 
**Holmes:**
If we cannot reach the exit no matter how high we climb, we have no choice but to overturn the concept of a 'void'.
 
**Holmes:**
It'll be a gamble as to where we actually exit, but in five minutes, even that won't be an option for us anymore!
 
**Nemo:**
I'm sorry, we don't have that many resources left after all our battles so far!
 
**Nemo:**
It's taking us all we have just to fly this ship!
 
**Nemo:**
Even if we shut one engine down, there's not enough time to generate a Spiritron Warhead!
 
**Gordolf:**
In other words&mdash;you're saying we can't get out of here as long as there's no exit?
 
**Holmes:**
Yes...and then we will no longer be able to go anywhere.
 
**Holmes:**
If the connection to the outside world is lost, this void will be worse than a black hole.
 
**Holmes:**
Black holes are gravity wells that even light cannot escape from, but even then, an exit still exists.
 
**Holmes:**
There is still a chance for escape if we could navigate like a leapfrog.
 
**Holmes:**
But here in this void, even an exit itself doesn't exist.
 
**Holmes:**
No matter how advanced humanity's means of transportation get, there is no escape from this space&mdash;
 
**Holmes:**
A 'pit' in the truest sense of the word. We are falling towards the abyss even as we climb.
 
**Gordolf:**
This is no time to be impressed&mdash;! Blast it, is there nothing we can do!?
 
**Gordolf:**
It's not like we're under attack by the enemy. It's not like the ship is in any danger of exploding!
 
**Gordolf:**
I will not accept being defeated just because we couldn't find an exit.
 
**Nemo Marine:**
Report, repoorrrt!!!! A mysterious explosion has been confirmed 3000 km away!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
The void is being torn asunder and you can see the outside!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
That heat ray, no doubt about it. It's Albion! Albion's mana emission!
 
**Nemo Marine:**
I don't know why, but for some reason, Albion attacked the Abyssal Insect!
 
**Narration:**
Having used up all her power, she fell.
 
**Narration:**
The sky of the end. Longing for that distant boundary, she spiralled down towards the ground.
 
**Narration:**
Neither reason nor memories no longer existed. All that made her who she was had crumbled.
 
**Narration:**
What remained was a lump of flesh that had fallen off the dead dragon.
 
**Narration:**
No purpose, no wish. A falling star, meant only to crumble away now.
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
However, she felt pain shooting through her hollow heart. She knew there was something she had to remember.
 
**Narration:**
“&mdash;Searching&mdash;Searching. Searching&mdash;”
 
**Narration:**
Scenery that crumbled each time it was recalled. Each time she viewed those records that could never be replayed,
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
&mdash;, &mdash;aaa&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
Vivid sparks scattered across her cells.
 
**Narration:**
Who am I? Who was I?
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;As if to answer those questions of why she had been soaring across this land.
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
&mdash;Aaaaa&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
And among them, she saw it.
 
**Narration:**
That which destroys the Fairy Kingdom. That which guided the Fairy Kingdom to this conclusion.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;The White Dragon of Britain.
 
**Narration:**
That which devours the world her loved ones lived in, that which she shares the same cause with. That apocalyptic figure.
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
Aaa&mdash;aaa. Aaaaaaaaaaa......!!!!
 
**Narration:**
Spreading those broken wings. Shouting from that crushed throat.
 
**Narration:**
Those scales falling off from her flight. That flesh falling off, unable to endure the restart.
 
**Narration:**
Accepting all of them, the dragon soared.
 
**Fairy Knight Mélusine:**
&mdash;That's right. I have to fly. I have to fly.
 
**Fairy Knight Mélusine:**
Even if I cannot be proud of anything as a fairy. Even if I cannot be praised for anything as a knight.
 
**Fairy Knight Mélusine:**
Even if I'm just an outsider who, from the beginning, only ever imitated people...!
 
**Narration:**
She was not a fairy of Britain.
 
**Narration:**
She was a misfit who belonged with neither fairies nor humans, because she was a superior life form.
 
**Narration:**
The Dragon of the Boundary was treated as a being of pan-human history, even in the Lostbelt.
 
**Narration:**
From the start, she was a foreign life form.
 
**Narration:**
From the start, she never had a place to belong in this Britain.
 
**Fairy Knight Mélusine:**
I never had any land or peace. I cannot&mdash;
 
**Fairy Knight Mélusine:**
I must not desire them. All I have is this scenery.
 
**Fairy Knight Mélusine:**
This boundary that divides the heavens and the earth, the planet and the universe.
 
**Narration:**
But there was something she had gained.
 
**Narration:**
She had something, even if it was false, even if it was something she had let go of.
 
**Narration:**
She could no longer remember anything, but this void in her memory circuits showed that it did exist.
 
**Fairy Knight Mélusine:**
The name of this craft is...the label attached to this record is...
 
**Narration:**
The atmosphere scraped away at the craft. The faster it went, the more the flying object lost its appearance as a dragon.
 
**Narration:**
At the rate it was going, it would self-destruct. What little life remaining in it would burn out.
 
**Narration:**
Disqualified as a weapon and paradoxical as a life form. The dragon's own thoughts pointed out its mistakes.
 
**Narration:**
Despite this.
 
**Narration:**
“Reason: unnecessary. Objective: subdue all that threatens Britain.”
 
**Narration:**
The flames that lit in her eyes accelerated that iron body.
 
**Fairy Knight Mélusine:**
I am Mélusine&mdash;Fairy Knight Mélusine!
 
**Fairy Knight Mélusine:**
Fly...! Even if you're just broken remains...!
 
**Narration:**
She cut through the winds and confronted the enemy. She soared, beyond that apocalyptic scenery.
 
**Narration:**
As one of the lives saved by this Britain, the crumbling dragon's final roar resounded.
 
**Aurora:**
...aaa...that sound just now.
 
**Narration:**
She felt as though she heard a strangely irritating sound, and stirred.
 
**Narration:**
It was moments after she had been pierced by the Fairy Knight's blade. Lying on her back, she opened her eyes in a daze.
 
**Aurora:**
How very quiet...I wonder if the tumult from the city has subsided.
 
**Aurora:**
Hehe. I suppose that must be the case. They were making a ruckus for so long, they must surely be tired by now.
 
**Aurora:**
Didn't I say so? You only need to wait for it to subside. Someone else will take care of all your worries.
 
**Aurora:**
That's how it has always been with me. Surely the same must have happened this time too, right?
 
**Narration:**
The sound of coughing.
 
**Narration:**
She spoke with her usual grace, with a gentle smile.
 
**Narration:**
There was no longer anyone in the room. There were no longer any survivors in the city.
 
**Narration:**
Only memories of the past continued to echo.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
“To shine the brightest”. That is the only love you harbor.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
You've never thought of cultivating yourself. You've never thought of growing or making an effort.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Because you were born complete.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
There is no need to toil like the Earth Clan. No need to scar like the Fang Clan.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
No need to learn like the Wing Clan. No need to serve like the Mirror Clan.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Fairies whose worth lies in just being there. That is the conclusion drawn by the Wind Clan.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
&mdash;You are the embodiment of that, Aurora.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
You love no one, and in return, you need no one. All you need are ornaments to adorn yourself with.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Truly a fascinating way of being. I like it. Yes. I love it.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
But, you're no good when someone more popular than you shows up.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
It's not like you to do it yourself. Let your followers handle it.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Just like you did with Londinium. Or just like you did with Ainsel.
 
**Aurora:**
What are you talking about, Oberon? They brought their own demise on themselves, you know?
 
**Aurora:**
I was sad, too...but there must have been some kind of grudge...
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
I see. That's a relief.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Then you knowing Gawain would be there at the human farm in the west,
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
and you sending along a capable fairy horse as a watcher, are all just me imagining things as well.
 
**Aurora:**
I did know of Gawain's schedule, but...
 
**Aurora:**
Is there a problem with her running into the Child of Prophecy?
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
None at all. Thanks to that, my schedule's moved up. It is a shame that we lost an actor, though.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Well then, I'll be counting on you from now on. Play nice with Spriggan.
 
**Aurora:**
Are you leaving already?
 
**Aurora:**
I'd have liked to hear more interesting stories from you...what a pity.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
You already know the whole story, more or less, even without me needing to tell you.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
As a matter of fact, I'm no match for the Wind Clan when it comes to espionage. There has never been a scarier means of doctoring information than the 'Voice of the Wind'.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Oh, but&mdash;
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Will you kindly refrain from laying a hand on Artoria and Fujimaru?
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
They're both important pawns of mine. For defeating Morgan, that is.
 
**Aurora:**
Oh dear, you're making a face I've never seen you make before. I'm almost jealous of them.
 
**Aurora:**
Tell me, Oberon. You said your purpose is Morgan's downfall, but...
 
**Aurora:**
I can trust you on that, right? You're not a pest meddling with my Britain, are you?
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Of course. I act to secure the future of Britain.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
We're sitting here like this precisely because I believe you to be the most suitable ruler for Britain.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
But it is true that you should not trust me too much. After all, my words are all lies.
 
**Aurora:**
Hm? What do you mean?
 
**Aurora:**
If everything you say is a lie, then your words 'don't trust me too much' would also be a lie...
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
That's the kind of Heroic Spirit I am.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
I do not hide the truth, neither do I spread lies.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
From the very beginning, the words of Fairy King Oberon are 'not worth placing trust in'.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Whether it be a truth or a falsehood, the moment I speak of it will make it a lie.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
I'm your polar opposite, Aurora. Everything becomes the truth with you.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
No matter what dark thoughts you harbor. No matter how much you pretend to be someone you're not.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
The moment you put them into words, the fairies, the world and even you yourself, will come to believe there is not a shred of lie in those words.
 
**Aurora:**
Hehe. Oberon, you eccentric. Always saying something incomprehensible.
 
**Aurora:**
Umm, in other words...you're calling me a liar? Something like, it takes one to know one?
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
Of course not. You don't even realize you're lying yourself.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
You're both perpetrator and bystander. That's how you've survived this far.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
You're not the most beautiful fairy in Britain.
 
**Bug sitting on the Desk:**
You're the most innocent usurper in Britain.
 
**Aurora:**
My word, he was a cute one. I should have captured him and killed him.
 
**Narration:**
The most beautiful fairy in Britain. The most glamorous fairy in Britain.
 
**Narration:**
To be such was her 'purpose'. For 3,000 years, she strove to be like that.
 
**Narration:**
Neither lies nor violence were sins. They were just the price to pay to be like that.
 
**Narration:**
She had no awareness of evil. No awareness of good. Everything was but a tool for her to 'shine'.
 
**Narration:**
However&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
&mdash;Long ago, just once&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
Just once, she did something that did not benefit herself.
 
**Narration:**
In the year 1600 of the Queen's Calendar, in the Lake District. When she paid a visit to the hometown of the Mirror Clan with her attendants.
 
**Narration:**
In a dark lake, she found that creature.
 
**Narration:**
A writhing lump of meat. A repulsive being, immersed in rotting filth.
 
**Aurora:**
Oh dear&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
All she had was a scheme. She just wanted to look good in front of her attendants.
 
**Narration:**
“The most beautiful fairy in Britain saving the most repulsive thing in Britain.”
 
**Narration:**
An act meant to show how being able to do this made her more wonderful than anyone else.
 
**Aurora:**
I am Aurora. Do you have a name?
 
**Dragon Corpse:**
&mdash;, &mdash;..., &mdash;...
 
**Narration:**
The one thing that surprised her was that the lump of meat she had embraced wept like a person.
 
**Narration:**
She had never seen tears as tragic, as warm, or as sincere before.
 
**Narration:**
It was not envy that followed after that&mdash; what she felt about her own actions was&mdash;
 
**Aurora:**
&mdash;My word, I never wanted to touch a thing like that.
 
**Narration:**
“I want to be like you”. With those words, the lump of meat became a beautiful fairy.
 
**Narration:**
She may have been immortal, but she aged all the same. The brilliance of her wings had diminished since the Queen's Calendar began.
 
**Narration:**
Unless she amused herself every day with new and unusual matters, that brilliance would certainly fade.
 
**Aurora:**
&mdash;Aah, and yet that girl.
 
**Narration:**
Strong, beautiful, and unfading above all else.
 
**Narration:**
As she did not realize that she was a repulsive creature, there was no need for even innocence.
 
**Aurora:**
See? Even now, in a place like that.
 
**Narration:**
A dragon fairy soaring in a sky of solitude. How annoying. How hateful. How unpleasant.
 
**Narration:**
While she lied there, covered in mud, on the ground. That fairy remained more beautiful than anyone else.
 
**Aurora:**
Foolish child...if you had killed me...
 
**Narration:**
The dragon fairy would become a lump of meat once more.
 
**Narration:**
She would never come to love the dragon. With her pride on the line, she would never allow the dragon to be rewarded.
 
**Narration:**
The dragon should continue to suffer forever, despairing at the false words of love.
 
**Narration:**
That longing, that despair, that is what made the dragon a fairy.
 
**Narration:**
Above all else, that dragon had to continue to protect her, the source of its suffering.
 
**Narration:**
But that dragon ended her life, not for itself but for her sake.
 
**Aurora:**
Yes, that's right. I am not afraid of death.
 
**Aurora:**
What I fear is losing my brilliance. Fading away and no longer being special.
 
**Aurora:**
That's why&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
Even if it meant the dragon would to return to being a repulsive lump of meat,
 
**Narration:**
it killed the one it loved the most in the world, the miracle that saved it, Aurora. For her sake, with its own hands.
 
**Aurora:**
I really do hate you...Fine then, I finally feel relieved now that we've parted ways.
 
**Aurora:**
Look, Oberon. A fool like that is what it means to be innocent.
 
**Narration:**
Something she embraced for appearances' sake. Reflecting her own ugliness, like the surface of a lake.
 
**Aurora:**
Go away. Go away...
 
**Narration:**
But what came afterwards truly was beautiful.
 
**Narration:**
For the first time, she smiled, knowing she had done something good.
 
**Aurora:**
Higher and higher...
 
**Aurora:**
Higher than anything...
 
**Narration:**
The wreckage of a crumbling dragon.
 
**Narration:**
While staring up at it like a child, her life ended, along with her brilliance.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's the exit&mdash;!|
 

---

 
**Gordolf:**
R-right, that is indeed the exit! But why would Albion do that!?
 
**Nemo:**
Worry about the details later! Da Vinci, how far away is our destination!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Distance to the tear in the void, 800 km! It's further than it looks, but we can definitely make it! Captain!
 
**Nemo:**
All hands, grab onto something, anything will do! Meunière, maximum output! Don't worry about anything else!
 
**Meunière:**
R-roger, leave it to me! Storm Border, full steam ahead!
 
**Meunière:**
Let's step on it, all the way to the sun!
 
**Narration:**
Oberon fell.
 
**Narration:**
Through bottomless cavities and never-ending tunnels, he fell endlessly.
 
**Narration:**
He no longer had the strength to take flight. No, after all&mdash;
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
The wings of my back are just for show. As if I could fly into the sky, you fool.
 
**Narration:**
He sneers hatefully. In truth, he must have been delighted.
 
**Narration:**
Although he had been bested, Oberon had accomplished his goal.
 
**Narration:**
The only thing that irked him was the fact that he couldn't take Chaldea down with him.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Go, go! Fly off wherever the hell you want! It's a relief knowing I won't have to see you anymore!
 
**Narration:**
Moving away further and further.
 
**Narration:**
The Foreign Magus and the other Child of Prophecy— his companions on that long journey—were flying off into that distant sky.
 
**Narration:**
And Oberon, the Great Liar, hatefully saw them off.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Well, it doesn't matter. My wish for Britain's destruction came true.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Ahh, but&mdash;
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
O fictitious you. Titania, who could love the twisted Oberon.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
My wish to destroy pan-human history for your sake could not come true.
 
**Narration:**
Born 'that way' and thrown aside as 'nothing' afterwards.
 
**Narration:**
His sacrificial love that could only exist within a tale.
 
**Narration:**
&mdash;or perhaps, even if he had encountered something similar to that,
 
**Narration:**
Oberon, the Great Liar, would not have acknowledged it.
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Ahh, but still, even though I got beaten to a pulp&mdash;
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Why am I this calm?
 
**Narration:**
The abyssal hole was disappearing. Falling endlessly.
 
**Narration:**
And in the midst of it all:
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
Hmph, so that's the sky of pan-human history...
 
**Oberon Vortigern:**
I'll be damned, if it isn't so beautiful it makes you want to puke&mdash;
 
**Narration:**
And so the lid closed on the infinite void. The Insect of the Abyss fell, never to reach anywhere.
 
## Epilogue: Finish 
 
**Nemo:**
We'll reach the boundary of normal space in 40, 30, 20...!
 
**Nemo:**
Stop Triton Engines two through four! Decelerate to standard cruising speed now!
 
**Nemo:**
Here it comes, everyone brace for impact! Up ahead lies the skies above the British Lostbelt&mdash;no...
 
**Nemo:**
The island of Britain!
 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Look out the window!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah&mdash;yeah!|
 
**Mash:**
Yes, it's a familiar sky! Shall we head for the deck!?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's head for the deck, Mash!
 

---

 
**Nemo:**
Attention all hands. Our vessel has made a safe return to the skies above the island of Britain.
 
**Nemo:**
State of alert has been lifted.
 
**Nemo:**
Return any self-defense armaments to the armory promptly and return to your assigned stations.
 
**Nemo:**
Furthermore, Commander Gordolf has an announcement to make. Here's the mic.
 
**Gordolf:**
H-hmm! You did well on this unprecedented, long-term operation.
 
**Gordolf:**
The surveyors who explored an unknown world, cooperated with the locals, and prevented the collapse of the world.
 
**Gordolf:**
The staff who stood by and maintained the ship in total darkness for 50 days.
 
**Gordolf:**
The Observation Lens SHEBA has returned to its normal state thanks to your efforts.
 
**Gordolf:**
The predicted Collapse that would've propagated from Britain has been thoroughly purged!
 
**Gordolf:**
Therefore, I consider our operation on the island of Britain&mdash;
 
**Gordolf:**
Our Lostbelt conquest, complete! Well done! Well done!
 
**Meunière:**
Snrk, what's with that? Hey, old man, you don't exactly have the most expansive vocabulary~!
 
**Gordolf:**
I-I simply voiced my honest feelings! How would you like to experience the ordeal of giving a speech for once!?
 
**Gordolf:**
It's no easy task to speak articulately and without any nervousness, I'll have you know!
 
**Nemo:**
Good grief...Da Vinci, hand me the mic.
 
**Nemo:**
Now then, onto business.
 
**Nemo:**
Our vessel is currently cruising at low speed for a systems check.
 
**Nemo:**
An airnet has been deployed at the edge of the deck. I hereby grant permission to head out onto the deck for 20 minutes.
 
**Nemo:**
&mdash;Go and have a look. It may be painful, but it's a way of getting closure.
 
**Nemo:**
A conclusion to your memories of Britain.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ah&mdash;|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(The color of the sky really is striking)
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;But, the island of Britain...
 
**Mash:**
The Fairy Kingdom of Britain...is no more...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It is, after all...a restored Singularity...
 

---

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But, it still existed. Just like the other Lostbelts.|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Yes. Yes...!
 
**Mash:**
The priceless memories of a journey that taught me a lot of precious lessons...!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Heeey! Fujimaru, Maaaash!
 
**Mash:**
Da Vinci! Did you also come here to have a look at Britain?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yep. I came here to say my goodbyes, as someone who travelled that land.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I got some booze from Bakery. Figured I'd pour one out for Mike.
 
**Da Vinci:**
This is my goodbye, Mike, and here's a parting gift. Even now, you're living it up at that tavern.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I believe and hope so. Even in a different world, once pruned and now corrected.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if the universe deems it unnecessary and halts any observation of it.
 
**Da Vinci:**
What once was will remain, even now, within the planet's memories.
 
**Da Vinci:**
&mdash;I'll cross that boundary and pay you a visit someday. To see how much progress you've made.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah...|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I suppose you will, Da Vinci...
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oops, speaking of which, I have other business too!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Mash, Fujimaru, hurry on over to my workshop!
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's this Saint Graph that's started glowing and going 'meow, meow'!
 
**Da Vinci:**
We'll check up on it. Tag along, summoner! There's no telling what'll pop up!
 
**Mash:**
Hmm. If that's the case, then please leave it to me. I won't lose, no matter what shows up.
 
**Mash:**
Because I'm Super Kyrielight, powered up from the Fairy Kingdom.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh...speaking of which, Mash...!|
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes! What's the matter, Master!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Your Saint Graph output's gone back to normal.|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Super forms tend to come with a time limit.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;!
 
**Mash:**
I-I figured as much, that's fine! I'll sulk alone later!
 
**Mash:**
Leaving that aside, let's head for Da Vinci's workshop!
 
**Mash:**
For some reason, my heart is throbbing. I have a feeling that a wonderful encounter awaits!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Is that so~~? I suppose I'll bet on Super Kyrielight's intuition.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Now then, farewell once more to Britain. Thank you for all the encounters.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Then&mdash;let's be off, Fujimaru.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Our journey has yet to end. Engrave these memories in your heart for now and let's go home.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Yes!|

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Got it. Goodbye, Britain!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I'm a little nervous, though.
 
**Mash:**
I wonder what sort of Heroic Spirit this newly summoned individual is?
 
**Sion:**
&mdash;TRISMEGISTUS II. Cessation of Catastrophe Defragmentation.
 
**Sion:**
Switching the situation over to Catastrophe Automation. Congratulations on locating the unexpected dead end and correcting it.
 
**Sion:**
Dear me, I expected nothing less of Chaldea! You prevented the future of the Collapse 23 hours and 58 minutes in!
 
**Sion:**
But no time to sit around here either. I suppose I'll start preparing for the next dead end.
 
**Sion:**
Let's see, the remaining special, dangerous cases are...
 
**Sion:**
The juvenile Beast that flew away from Britain and the possibility of the formation of the largest Singularity ever recorded...
 
**Sion:**
As for Kadoc's recovery...
 
**Sion:**
I was unable to extract the so-called Sirius Light, so we'll have to just give up on that front...
 
**Sion:**
Hmm, the hieroglyphic predictions say 'No problem. Rebel. Eyelids, eyelids'.
 
**Sion:**
I haven't the faintest clue. Might as well be in Arabic. Well, let's ignore this too.
 
**Sion:**
More importantly, what we ought to be paying attention to right now is our dear lady. I wonder what move she'll make.
 
**Sion:**
Oops, and here's this prediction...This is as obvious as it gets, but we don't have much time.
 
**Sion:**
Now then, I'll need to hurry with the preparations too.
 
**Sion:**
Chaldea has conquered six Lostbelts now. The Alien God must surely have finished her studying.
 
**Sion:**
Both sides have narrowed their targets down to one.
 
**Sion:**
This is as far as victories without casualties go. There's no assurance of safety from this point onwards, is there?
