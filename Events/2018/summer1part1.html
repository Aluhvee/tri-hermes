href="#prelude" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Prelude</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> —So, I&#39;m counting on you again, Fujimaru, Mash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I will prepare the Rayshift, so wait one moment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> [♂ Hey /♀ Oh], what&#39;s wrong, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you feeling sick?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, no, Senpai. It&#39;s nothing. Nothing, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How to put it... I&#39;m feeling uneasy in a way I have not experienced before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that I think about it, we&#39;ve really had a lot of unexpected Rayshifts so far.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But what is about to happen is incomparable. It looks like a wonderous, amazing experience...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Perhaps not so much a shift as it will be a drift?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Ah, I&#39;m sorry. That doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please don&#39;t worry about it, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, are you sick? Let me feel your forehead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...O-Oh! S-Senpai! What are you...!? I&#39;m, I&#39;m fine. My temperature is normal!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m the same as usual... No, I&#39;m better than usual!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> When you say that, all I can do is worry...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> —A bad premonition, huh? No need for concern, Master.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> This time, I will be accompanying you, too. We should assume one or two unexpected events will occur.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Meat tastes better when there&#39;s some tendon in it. Challenges are more fun when they&#39;re difficult.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Hmm. I don&#39;t think we should expect bad things to happen. However...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I agree with her. There&#39;s no need for concern. No matter what happens, we will be by your side.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, Altria... Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And we&#39;ll be backing you up as much as possible from the Command Room. Small miscalculations will be instantly fixed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes... That&#39;s right. Chaldea&#39;s staff are all intelligent people.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, everyone, for saying something strange. Let&#39;s do our best as always, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> YEAH!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Good answer! Fujimaru is getting used to the Celtic style!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sir, yes sir!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Yes, what is it?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Ah... You were just responding to Scáthach, were you? Sorry. I thought you said “sire.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, preparation complete. Systems are good to go!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So, let&#39;s go! I&#39;m counting on you as usual! Rayshift—start!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Huh!? What the hell is this!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Monitor malfunction here... too...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ugh, more trouble as usual! This is bad! What on earth&#39;s going on—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...and hurry up, to—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m trying, I&#39;m trying! But... this isn&#39;t a simple value fluctuation, it&#39;s a trap!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s a big hole in front of our usual Rayshift point! We can&#39;t fix it with simple trajectory correction!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Really? Then jump! Jump, Romani!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Like this?! Hmph, hah! ...Owwww!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The doctor goofed around at the wrong time, so I sent him away! Operator, send the anchor, hurry!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We have to at least pinpoint our destination! ...What, you already did? Nice!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Ah, but it&#39;s no use! We&#39;re... We&#39;re drifting!</p><h2 id="section-1-castaways" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-castaways" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: &quot;Castaways&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...pai... Senpai...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, Senpai, you&#39;re awake! Thank goodness!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where are we?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know. Looks like the Rayshift didn&#39;t execute correctly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At the very least, I don&#39;t think this is our intended destination.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No one seems to be injured–including Fou, who has tagged along once again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor... Doctor?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...As you can see, we&#39;ve lost all communications with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s why... we don&#39;t even know where we are...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Well, it&#39;s not Britain. Just look at these tropical-looking plants.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmm. Right now, our problem is... not where this is, but what lives here.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Master, behind you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, watch out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh no... I left myself wide open!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now is not the time for sarcasm! Watch out!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh... This is an unknown enemy type! It&#39;s quite violent, but we have to fight back, Master!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Heh heh. Unknown enemies on an unknown land... Now this is getting very convenient for me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Phew. It seems we&#39;re safe for now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s get back to assessing our situation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, let&#39;s. Does anyone know anything about this place?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who here knows where we are?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hmm. Unfortunately, I have no recollection of this place.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Same here. To tell you the truth, I have no idea where this is. At the very least we are not in Japan.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I&#39;m not sure either, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s France.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;ve seen many places... but this doesn&#39;t seem to be one of them. It&#39;s a nice beach, though...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I agree. Definitely relaxing. ...I just can&#39;t pinpoint the location.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t ask me, the hell would I know? But anyway, more importantly... (Sideways glance)</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> As I said earlier, this does not appear to be Britain. Apologies for not being able to help more.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> This should be where we pirates demonstrate our worth... But it&#39;s rather difficult since there&#39;s no identifying trait anywhere that I can see.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> What do you make of it, Mary?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Hmm, can&#39;t really say. I&#39;ve seen countless beaches like this.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...But those crabs we just fought? They were a first for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So many Servants!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s so lively...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master. I do feel a little uneasy because we can&#39;t get in touch with the doctor and Chaldea, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> With this many Servants around, I am sure nothing can stop—</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Hey! Hey, hey, heeeeey!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I&#39;ve been standing here forever, and you didn&#39;t even notice me!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> You went and broke-oro my fragile kokoro! Imma need someone to give me a hug!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Sheesh, even my tamed self is gonna go Caribbean Smash on you! A whole hour of waiting and all you&#39;re doing is staring at the girls...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Ah, wait. Actually, I guess anyone&#39;d do the same...and thus so would I.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...But still, don&#39;t ignore me! Notice me!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Hahaha, aren&#39;t you being a little hasty, Mr. Beard?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> In situations like this, we must not outshine others; we may glow, but only discreetly.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> After all, yes, there are too many attractive ladies gathered here!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> If we sparkle too much, all kinds of slightly troublesome incidents might occur!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Polygamy, swinging, and orgies, to name a few!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> ...Don&#39;t you think so, Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Yes. As expected from my liege... You really understand your...self well. Really keen observation.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> (Sigh) Does your Cycle always have to start with a skit?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...I apologize. Despite his behavior, he is rather excited about all of this.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Yeah, I understand how he feels. To be taken adrift and arrive at an unknown island is nothing short of dangerous.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> No, what my lord is happy about is not the adventure that awaits us, but being able to develop a deeper bond with all the heroes here...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hahaha. Well, when the time comes, things will happen. We should just enjoy the view, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> The beautiful sea, the gentle breeze, crabs you can&#39;t help but run your sword through... It&#39;s a curious little beach, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...Crabs have it rough, don&#39;t you think? I mean, only being able to walk sideways all the time and all that?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> Still, the way they always look their opponent dead in the eye, that strong spirit... It&#39;s something all martial artists should learn from.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> And what about those hermit crabs, eh? Carrying your house on your back, like a mobile shut-in... Jinako should learn from them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmm. It seems the men are all gathered over there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There were more people when we departed, but looks like we got separated. I hope they&#39;re safe.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I&#39;ll ask because we&#39;re both pirates. Blackbeard, do you know where we are?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Oi, I&#39;m talking to you!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Oh, please excuse me! It&#39;s just... it&#39;s been so long since I last spoke with you, Missy Mary! It&#39;s like we&#39;re... touching each other with our words... It just makes me so excited!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Your voice is so irresistible! How do I put it... I like the way it passes through my ears, all slippery yet sticky!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> That does it, I&#39;m going to murder him.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Yes, let&#39;s. We&#39;ll cut him into pieces.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Wait, wait, wait! You want to know about where we are, right!? To tell you the truth, I can&#39;t tell just by our current situation.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I knew it, he&#39;s useless. Now I won&#39;t feel bad when I slit his throat.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Don&#39;t jump to conclusions! You really can&#39;t judge porn by its thumbnail you know!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I was going to say we might get a better idea if we take a look from the sea!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Yes... You&#39;re right. We pirates remember continents and their shapes by how they look when viewed from a ship at sea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then... could you go and check?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re counting on you, Blackbeard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, that is probably the best option we have.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Whaaat? No way? You really going to tell me that, Master?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re telling the super kawaii Blackbeard to go into the unknown sea alone...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I don&#39;t even have a ship... I don&#39;t want to use my Noble Phantasm for this...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> What are you talking about? You do have a ship, see?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Isn&#39;t that just a plain ol&#39; log that drifted to the beach!? A lonely log!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Here you go. Now you have an oar, too. It&#39;s perfect!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...That&#39;s just a plank! A plain ol&#39; piece o&#39; wood!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> If I go out to sea with this... I&#39;ll die! Me, a Servant! I&#39;ll definitely die!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Ugh, shut up already. Why do you have to make such a big deal out of this?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...Fine. If you go, I&#39;ll give you a reward.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Say what!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He just did a complete 180! Look at that twinkle in his eye!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Hah... Hah... Hah... (Gulp) “Reward,” Missy Mary? What kind of reward?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Let&#39;s see... I&#39;ll let you touch my body one time. How about that?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Anywhere!?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Anywhere you want.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> YAS! It&#39;s finally my time to shine! Back in a jiffy, dohoho, hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, there he goes... Just straddled the log, grabbed the plank, and rowed right out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All it took is eight small words... I don&#39;t really know what to say. Is this really okay?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> I&#39;ll ask the same thing, but for slightly different reasons: is this really okay, Mary? For you?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Of course not, but I don&#39;t mind. It&#39;s just a hunch, but I can feel something abnormal about this sea.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I doubt he&#39;ll come back in one piece.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...! More enemies!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Hmph. Attacking us while we&#39;re busy looking at the sea, huh?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Looks like the island&#39;s inhabitants understand battle. Not by knowledge, but by instinct.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Master Fujimaru, what shall we do? We could always just abandon Mr. Beard and flee...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We have to annihilate them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Mash Kyrielight, going in!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s believe in Blacky and run!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, it&#39;s wonderful you have faith in Blackbeard&#39;s fighting spirit, but that won&#39;t do!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have to take them out! Just in case Blackbeard comes back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s really quiet here, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Feels like it&#39;s just the two of us here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Ah, and what a nice sky. All those stars, shining so bright...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It really is beautiful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s perfect, a sky full of stars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I looked up at the sky in other Rayshift destinations, too, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think this is the first time seeing so many stars without other light sources getting in the way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I feel a little strange.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Since I met you, Senpai, I&#39;ve experienced many things I never thought I would experience...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and seen many things I never thought I would see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> After all, until we met, Chaldea was all I ever knew.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now, everything is new and colorful...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Senpai. I... I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The stars are so beautiful, and silent, and I guess I spoke without thinking.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m glad I get to spend time like this with you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. I&#39;m really glad, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was an unexpected accident which brought us here. Honestly, there&#39;s no telling how things will pan out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At this very moment, however, I feel very lucky to have seen this starry sky with you, Senpai.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Hmm... I kind of expected Blackbeard to be back by now, too...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> My blood&#39;s pumping and I&#39;m ready for some action, but there&#39;s nothing to do. What to do, what to do...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Oh? Aching for some action, hmm? I&#39;ll go a round or two with you, if you want.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Look, if I try to kill time with you, the only thing getting killed... will be me!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I don&#39;t want to badmouth you, my mentor. But try to read the room a little, would ya?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> This ain&#39;t the Land of Shadows where violence rules, so try and adapt just a bit, kay?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Urk! Why you...! What a flippant disciple... Still, you have a point... Rrrrr...!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Good. Now that I shut her up, maybe I&#39;ll go fishing. It&#39;s been a while, but I&#39;m sure it will come back to me.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Heh... Martha. You don&#39;t need to hold back. You can&#39;t hide the truth from these eyes.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Huh!? Wh-What are you talking about!?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> We&#39;re by the sea, and it&#39;s summer. In a place where everyone lets themselves go, I can tell... You&#39;re getting really worked up, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hahaha, no need to keep it all inside. What do you say? Shall we go at it right now?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Worked up? Go at it!? Why you...! That&#39;s enough sexual harassment, thank you very much!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Alas, that&#39;s not what I was getting at. What I desire is the combination technique from you and Tarasque.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> There are no other saints around.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I thought you would be able to show me your forbidden technique if there&#39;s no one around to mock you. Was I mistaken?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh, there you go again, techniques and battle once more...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Still... It&#39;s pretty boring just waiting for the return of our one-man scout party.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I need something to keep myself preoccupied, too...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...Wait. All of your desires are about to come true. Look over there at that shore.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Mikon! Really!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, Tamamo. Something is definitely coming. I can see it, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s a large group of giant crabs!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...Umm, that&#39;s not what I desired...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...It is impressive how fast they scuttle along with their multiple legs. As a time-killer, they&#39;re really more than we deserve.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh, the gods! That&#39;s so typical of you, Karna, but still... Still...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The crabs aren&#39;t changing course! It seems we&#39;ll just have to fight them!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Sweet, merciful heaven, it&#39;s too hot for this business!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Agreed. But never mind the enemy and their numbers... I mean, look at me!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Tch. This ain&#39;t beach armor, that&#39;s for sure.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh well. Crustaceous monsters from the sea have appeared... Heh heh heh, this kind of feels like old times!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Ah. Is this what that hack samurai was referring to?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> What&#39;s that? Over there on the shore?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> As always, my liege has good eyes. It appears some seaweed washed ashore... or not.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> It&#39;s a dead body! The man must have drowned and quietly drifted ashore during that frenetic battle.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I suppose we should give him proper rites and bury him.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> YES to beautiful girls, HELL NO to burial. I&#39;m...still...alive... (twitch twitch)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s Blackbeard! He came back while we were fighting!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s ask him what he found out. While we still can...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Blackbeard, tell us what you know.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Ah, a girl&#39;s voice penetrates my dizzy head... Aye, that reminds me. The reward... Where&#39;s my reward?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> After we hear your report. Now spill!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Hahehue, you&#39;ll be squirming after that, Missy Mary. I bet your heart&#39;s already poundin&#39; with anxiety an&#39; anticipation!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I can hardly wait myself. But report first, then fun.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Based on my observation of this land from the sea, I don&#39;t have a single clue of where we are.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> The alignment of the stars in the sky makes no sense. It doesn&#39;t help pinpoint our location at all.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Any other information?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Ah, cripes, me vission is getting blurry... All the blood rushin&#39; elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...The open ocean... High, battering waves... Even the tide is complicated and mysterious. Impossible for any ship to make a decent journey.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> And then... (cough cough) ...Oh, it&#39;s my fav doujin! What&#39;s it doin&#39; here? I thought I lost it... Shiver me timbers!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Hey! Please don&#39;t voyage into the afterlife before you&#39;ve told us everything!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Reward... If I only had my reward... I could hang in there...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I guess we don&#39;t have a choice. ...Oh, Blackbeard. I&#39;m so impressed that you made it back here.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> (monotone) Nice recon. You&#39;re the greatest pirate that ever sailed. I&#39;m so in awe. Yay.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Uh... Y-Yay...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mary just reached out to the trembling Blackbeard... and he responded...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Like a high-five.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> There, you touched me. That&#39;s your one touch. I held my end of the bargain, now keep talking.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...Ooooh... Oooooh...!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Even while I&#39;m trembling in despair, you appeal to me with the touch of a wee, soft palm.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Despair... Aye, despair! I, the fearsome Blackbeard, will show you all the true meaning of despair!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s suddenly gone into serious mode!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> “Despair”?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Heh heh, heh heh heh. I figured it out after investigating this land from the sea. The final conclusion—</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> This is... a desert island!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Haha lololol. A desert island... Impossible to escape... A harem lifestyle&#39;s inevitable. Men&#39;ll be mobbed by the ladies!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...And yet... And yet, why...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I&#39;m the one who worked the hardest, yet I can&#39;t participate!? That&#39;s like, RNG luck!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> You&#39;ve trampled on my dearest wish! May my blood stain this woooorrrld! May the Holy G-Cup be cursed!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Strange... I suddenly feel a deep affinity to him...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...How unfortunate. He didn&#39;t make it after all.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Going by what he said, it doesn&#39;t sound like a normal ocean. And... a desert island...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Communications with Chaldea are down... and it&#39;s just us, on a desert island in the middle of who-knows-where.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Just... Just what are we supposed to do in a situation like this?</p><h2 id="section-2-life-is-beautiful" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-life-is-beautiful" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;</h2><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Uggghhh... Once I heard there was no one here, I think this island started to feel even hotter.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I think foxes shine brightest when there&#39;s snow and cold, don&#39;t you, Master?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> My poor tail is soaked with sweat. You know what I&#39;m talking about, right, Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> The food we took with us when we left is almost gone.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Even if we just use it to keep Master alive, who knows how much is left...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> The way you shiver when you realize there&#39;s a long time till you hit port, and you&#39;re almost out of food...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> It reminded me of that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I should&#39;ve studied how to get by when you arrive on a deserted island with nothing.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wh-What do we do?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s no need to think too much about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll work itself out.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> That&#39;s right. No need to think too much about it, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Scáthach... Do you have a plan?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I don&#39;t know if you could call it a plan, but we have to do what we must.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Our first priority needs to be to try and contact Chaldea. And then we can request help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes... That&#39;s right. But the problem is that we can&#39;t get through. I don&#39;t think the system is broken...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Is it possible that if we leave this island and go elsewhere, the system will come back online?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s... a possibility.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We lost the connection once we arrived on this island, so if we leave, it might be restored.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But if we can&#39;t leave the island...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We mustn&#39;t forget Blackbeard&#39;s noble sacrifice...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> I think a good way to start may be trying to find a way off this place.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Yeah. Blackbeard told us that an ordinary ship wouldn&#39;t be enough.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...Which means that a good, proper ship just might.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> But...this island is uninhabited, right? Surely we wouldn&#39;t be able to procure such a ship?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> We can make one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Come again?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I said we can make one, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is a ship something you can...make?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> We may be able to steer a ship... But we don&#39;t know how to make one.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I know a thing or two about it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> By combining my runes, I can make almost anything.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I need time, and materials, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> S-So dependable!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> As far as I can tell, this island should have what we need. It seems very bountiful.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Thus, we probably don&#39;t need to worry about resources.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...It&#39;s the monsters that surprise me. I didn&#39;t expect to see this many stomping around like they own the place.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> An island&#39;s supposed to have a ruler, see. Be it human, beast, or god.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> So either the ruler has abandoned his duties, or he has forgotten them... It&#39;s a sad thing, either way.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was... Fou&#39;s subtle warning that monsters are approaching!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, they&#39;re back! Stop talking and help! Damn it! It&#39;s so hot in this armor!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> That&#39;s what you get for wearing such heavy protection. It&#39;s foolish to try and dress up to intimidate an opponent.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> You should take this opportunity to pick armor that suits your frame. Of course, even if you do—</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> That still won&#39;t be enough to bring your grade as a knight above negative.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Grrrrrr...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Either way, we can talk more after we beat them into the ground... I mean, drive them off!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> All right, where were we?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> It&#39;s going to take time to build a ship. It&#39;s not something you can do in an afternoon.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Our goal—</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Needs to be to find a way to live on this island while we gather the materials we need.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Live here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I&#39;m a little worried about that too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Materials?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Wood, stone, iron... Other things as well. Don&#39;t worry. I can modify them once I have them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m more worried about living here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The climate and topography here are both completely different from that in Chaldea. Who knows what kind of natural phenomena we might encounter?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It is also unclear what we&#39;ll face with the environment. And there&#39;s the problem of food and water... Will we be okay?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I can make almost anything you need–including ships.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Some of the knowledge I&#39;ve acquired includes how to survive, even on an uninhabited island.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> If you need anything, you can count on me.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> It might be inconvenient at first, but as we make what we need, life will get easier.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Heh. It&#39;ll be a form of training. You&#39;ll need to give it your all.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...Now then. I have a suggestion for everyone—</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmm. Not bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean!? It&#39;s great!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What do you mean!? It&#39;s great!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-U-Um! Scáthach?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-Why... swimsuits?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Why? First, this island is hot. Even if you&#39;re not wearing armor like Mordred.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Too much heat dulls the body, even if you&#39;re a Servant. And the heat affects you in combat too.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> A master warrior must adjust their appearance to match their location and conditions.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I&#39;ve altered your Spirit Origins to accommodate our surroundings. It&#39;s not bad, is it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ya got that right. It&#39;s nice and cool, and easier to move around. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I can swing my sword around more than usual now. Without my armor, I may be stronger than King Arthur!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Hmm. I need to prepare appropriate weapons for this outfit.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I think I still have what I picked up that one time at Waku Waku. A knight must always have the most appropriate weapon.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (What is that!? She took out this weird gun like it was the most ordinary thing in the world!)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (And it looks really summery, too! That&#39;s not fair!)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, right. I need to change my weapon too! I&#39;ll bring out this special item I&#39;ve been saving!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (Yeah, it&#39;s gotta be this: the shield that also becomes King Arthur&#39;s ship... I&#39;m glad I swiped it!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Those two aren&#39;t talking to each other, but they are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not getting in between them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master. Their relationship is extremely complicated, and who knows what will happen if you get involved.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s best to just go with the flow and watch what happens.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Come take a look at me.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> If you can&#39;t endure the heat, enjoy the heat. If the sun is strong, then use the sunlight...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> That&#39;s the way of a proper lady. What do you think, Master?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I can use my parasol as a spear, and become Lancer Tamamo-chan! ♡</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Hehe! I&#39;m in a swimsuit! On a tropical island! With Master!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> We&#39;re not just stuck here. We&#39;re not just stranded on an empty island.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> For me and Master, this is...yes... This is our honeymoon...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Hehe...hehehe...hehehehehehe...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> It&#39;s a little embarrassing to show so much skin... But I can&#39;t help it.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Given the situation, I must forget my role as a saint, and deal with this trouble as just plain old Martha.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I&#39;ve never done anything like this. It&#39;s a little exciting, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I spend a lot of time on the water, but it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve dressed up to swim.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Master, do I look weird?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> It&#39;s very cute, and it looks great on you, Mary♪</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re all such free spirits...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. When she said swimsuits, I was thinking competition ones. You all look great!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Blush and look away)</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hey, Master. No one minds if you look at their swimsuit.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> If you weren&#39;t allowed to look at it, it would be no different than being naked.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Averting your gaze is no different than refusing to look someone in the eye when you speak. It&#39;s rude.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> And so I say to you: gaze upon it all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (That seems like an amazing thing to say...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree that a swimsuit is better suited for this environment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But my one concern—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I understand. It&#39;s whether we can fight in these outfits or not, right?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> No need to worry. Even in our tropical island versions, we&#39;re still powerful Servants.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> This is true even if our classes have changed due to our unfamiliarity with swimsuits.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Now then, Master, your orders! I shall show you the power of summer!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. To be honest I didn&#39;t really believe it, but... way to go, everyone!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> That battle was an offering I made to our future together... Did you see it, Master?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> It&#39;s fun to have a different role than usual.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> I agree, Mary. This isn&#39;t a bad change of pace.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> All right! I landed a nasty strike right on their body!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> The beach really does make things feel more exciting! Not having my staff does make me a little uneasy, though! (Fwoosh fwoosh)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Even as she said that, Martha was shadowboxing...)</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> ...Heh. Fate must truly love me.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Everything&#39;s going my way... That&#39;s just how things work out for me.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Don&#39;t you think so, Diarmuid? By the way, which one is your type?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I hope you don&#39;t like the same one I do. Like what happened with Gráinne. Or what happened with Gráinne.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Um, well... that&#39;s kind of a hard question to answer... I couldn&#39;t say, really...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Also, I don&#39;t know why you had to say that twice.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Hahah! Don&#39;t worry. It was just a joke.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> The thing with Gráinne was just something the people around me set up. To be honest, I was surprised too.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> But this time, conditions are the same for both of us. It&#39;s a fair fight, I guess you could say.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> No, that&#39;s not right. It&#39;s not fair. You&#39;ve got that Love Spot!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> You&#39;re going to show it off by winking at all of them, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Wink! Wink!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I&#39;ll do nothing of the sort! Moreover, I would ask that you, my liege, keep your thumb out of your mouth!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s right, the guys are here, too...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Um, where are your swimsuits?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. Diarmuid&#39;s basically wearing a swimsuit already.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Even if the girls&#39; outfits have changed, our position hasn&#39;t. You just focus on the girls.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. I agree. We men will do our best not to stand out.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> ...Sheesh. My mentor&#39;s pretending to be calm, but she&#39;s more excited than anyone.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> She didn&#39;t need to change too... That combat outfit was water-resistant anyway.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> That settles it. I&#39;m staying as far away from her as possible. I&#39;m not getting close. Forget about the beach.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I&#39;m going to the mountains. Maybe I&#39;ll plant a field or something...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What happens now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This is going to be thrilling in a lot of ways...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. But I think the basic plan is just as Scáthach said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Our goal needs to be to get resources to escape. And to survive until we do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> For that to happen, I think we&#39;re going to need to build some new facilities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At first, it&#39;s going to be hard, I think— But I&#39;ll support you with everything I have.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll help you make the escape ship, and I&#39;ll help you make our life here better.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s search this island and gather materials and supplies!</p><h2 id="section-3-food-fighter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-food-fighter" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: &quot;Food Fighter&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We built a place to live, and a place for water. I thought we were doing well, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is the biggest mistake I&#39;ve ever made. How could I have not noticed?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We&#39;re almost out of food.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Servants don&#39;t need to eat. If anything, food is like a mood stabilizer for us.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> However, that&#39;s not the case for Master... This is a big problem. How did you guys get by so far?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve been eating the rations we brought from Chaldea, but they&#39;re about to run out as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We tried to conserve them, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess they had to run out eventually...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> That just means... we&#39;ll have to procure food ourselves.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> A lack of food is a serious issue. It doesn&#39;t just affect our Master, but it lowers our morale as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I thought Scáthach might be able to help, but I haven&#39;t seen her for a while...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So for now, we&#39;ll have to rely on ourselves. Let&#39;s see if we can find something to eat!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Hmm... all the plants are so different from the ones in Bethany. I&#39;m not sure which ones are safe to eat...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> But alas, it is best to remain calm in situations like this. Nothing will go wrong if we stick to our instincts.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I&#39;m nervous...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Humph. Master, why do you look so nervous?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I have a bad feeling about this...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Humph. Master, why do you look like you have a bad feeling about this?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> There&#39;s no need to worry. I used to feed all kinds of weird things to my little brothers, and they were mostly fine.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> In fact, they prayed even harder after they ate. They even had tears in their eyes when they did.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> The look on all those tough little boys&#39; faces reminded me of how He prayed over the suffering and sins of mankind.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> So don&#39;t worry. And don&#39;t disobey me. My gut feeling is pretty good at times like this, you know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (I don&#39;t know what their tears really meant, but I do know that whenever that happened, Martha didn&#39;t eat any of those things herself!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> F-For now, I&#39;ll get going! Please wait for me, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry, Master. I should&#39;ve read up on how to survive outdoors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I could barely find anything... All I managed to do was bring Fou back with me. He was wandering around over there.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...? Fo... Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like Fou just realized something!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, th-that&#39;s not what I meant, Fou! I brought you back here because you&#39;re fluffy and fun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I didn&#39;t bring you back here for your calories!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I can&#39;t say I found much either... Just a few different kinds of fruit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ooh... Well done! What are they? I&#39;ve never seen these shapes and colors before.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ... (Grin)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh no! I don&#39;t trust your instincts!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> You&#39;ve got a problem with my instincts!? It&#39;s never been wrong! It&#39;s fine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They all look like coconuts... but upon closer inspection, one has thorns, one is fluorescent pink...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And one smells terrible... I&#39;m getting kind of worried.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> At the very least, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll die instantly from eating them. Just spit it out if your tongue feels numb, got that?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Do the same if your stomach feels strange after you swallow.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> If you&#39;re having trouble regurgitating it, let me know. I&#39;ll use a special method to, um, knock it right out of you.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foooou!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Ahem. Anyway, that will tell us whether it&#39;s something ominous and deadly, at least.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> As a saint, I can swear that to you. Trust me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Okay, looks like you have no objections, so let&#39;s get started. Go ahead, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (So I really have to eat these on my own...?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-Of course, I&#39;ll try them with you, Senpai. We&#39;re in this together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, but wait. These look like coconuts, so their shells must be made like coconuts too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll go get something to cut this open—</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Haiiee-yaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She chopped the top off... with... just her hand!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Okay, you should be able to drink from it now. No need to thank me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Okay... here I go... GWAH!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-This is... It&#39;s spicy! Just as you&#39;d expect from something covered in thorns! It&#39;s spicier than a habanero!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> My whole body started to sweat instantly!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Well that&#39;s a shame. Still, I suppose it&#39;ll make some good seasoning... Anyway, let&#39;s try the pink one next.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> MATTHEW!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> H-Here I go... Uwagh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s tasteless. It&#39;s completely tasteless! And the texture is all weird and dry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If I had to compare it to something... It&#39;s like eating an eraser.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s probably okay if it&#39;s nutritious... but it&#39;s not something I&#39;d eat on my own... ever...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Huh? That&#39;s strange. Normally, at least one thing I find turns out to be edible.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Maybe my intuition&#39;s grown dull... Well, on to the last one.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> MOSES!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> O-Okay, let&#39;s try this... Mgaaghh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Hey, why aren&#39;t you saying anything!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m pretending not to notice the horrible stench that came after I opened it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is... It&#39;s edible. I... guess.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> What? Then it&#39;s fine, right? What&#39;s with that look on your face?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess the best way to describe the taste is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Spicy salted squid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Fermented soybeans.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It really doesn&#39;t taste like something... that you&#39;d expect from a fruit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I suppose you could eat it... if you forced yourself to. But that actually just makes it all the more disgusting.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> But it IS edible, right? That means more choice in an emergency. Good.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I have to say, Fujimaru, Mash, you&#39;re both too picky anyway.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> People in the past ate things that tasted a lot worse, you know. Just be grateful to the Lord that your food tastes like anything at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (That didn&#39;t sound very convincing.)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> But to tell you the truth, it wasn&#39;t just instinct this time. There was a reason that I thought this last one might be safe to eat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I saw a crab eating one that fell on the ground. It wouldn&#39;t do that if it was poisonous, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doesn&#39;t that mean, though... that it&#39;s crab food?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And we&#39;re spreading this smell everywhere. Which means...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I knew it! There they are!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh, more hungry lost lambs over there, too. Maybe they&#39;re in the same situation we are...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But let&#39;s take them out before we get eaten, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t think Master&#39;s food shortage can be solved with those mysterious fruits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Considering the taste and the fact that enemies attack every time we bite into one... At most, we can use it as emergency rations.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As for other sources of food... well...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh no, I didn&#39;t know we were in that much trouble. I guess we don&#39;t even have any bread.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...? I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t help you even if you keep staring at me like that, Master. I wish I could be of some help...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Huh? You were all looking for some food?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I&#39;m just about to go freshwater fishing. Wanna come with me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Fishing, huh? That does sound like a solution. But I have no experience... Besides, what about the equipment...?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> What, are you afraid you won&#39;t be able to reel any in? Don&#39;t worry, the best thing about fishing is even a beginner can catch some.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I can make rods for you. One each for Mash and Fujimaru, right? Piece of cake!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> As expected of a member of The Backspears Boys!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Okay, everyone! We&#39;re all going fishing!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I&#39;ve never been fishing myself, but it sounds like so much fun!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Freshwater style? Oh, what refined taste! There&#39;s no way I can pass this up. It&#39;ll be like summer vacation in Japan all over again!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I was thinking to go find some wild grass for Master, but you changed my mind. I&#39;d like to come with you, too.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Wow, got a lot more people now... Gotta make four more rods, huh? Well, I don&#39;t mind. The more the merrier! That&#39;s fishing for ya!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh, I see. So this squirming thing is the bait...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Yep. Recommended for beginners, too. Once you get enough experience, you can do without it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you put it on yourself, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I&#39;ll try!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you want me to put it on for you, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ... N-No, I&#39;m fine. Thank you though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can manage something like this by myself. I don&#39;t want to cause you any trouble!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You put it on a hook like this... It&#39;s okay, Mash, just relax...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I did it! I did it, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good job! Headpats for you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, no... you don&#39;t have to... I only did what everyone else should be able to do... I was just too inexperienced...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Now let&#39;s go fishing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I&#39;ll try my best!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Fishing is a hit-or-miss business. Taking it easy is the right manner to enjoy it.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Sitting next to Master, looking out over the water together as time passes us by...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> For me, that alone is enough.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Fishing can be such an elegant, upscale pastime as well.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Oh, I see someone here gets it. I agree with you. I guess knowledge does come with age.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Twagh! I-I dare you to say that to Scáthach as well! And you know what? How about you DROP DEAD!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oops, well, pardon me☆ Today, Tamamo is elegant and classic☆</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> This is my first time... It&#39;s okay to try without bait, right? Maybe I&#39;ll go ahead and do just that.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I meant it&#39;s okay for experienced fishermen like myself, though... Well, anyway, up to you.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Like what Miss Fox there said, you should be fine as long as you give it a try and keep a line dropped.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Well, Master, let&#39;s sit back and enjoy ourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m quite serious here. We must catch some big fish so Senpai can get some proper nutrients!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t catch any at all...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Try to hide your presence, Shieldy.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Mmmm... It&#39;s soooo frustrating...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Though I said spending time with Master would be enough, the fact that it is taking so long to catch something is making me a little...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> What, are you giving up already? You&#39;re less patient than I thought you were.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> You haven&#39;t caught any yet, either!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I&#39;m fine because I&#39;m enjoying the process. Besides, I&#39;m not hungry yet.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...It might be a problem with the rod. Maybe I should get in the stream directly and try my luck at spearfishing like a true Lancer would...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh. That&#39;s not good. A sophisticated woman wouldn&#39;t do that, and to be frank, it&#39;s a job more suited for the Cat...!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I, as a fancy mannequin, cannot stoop to that level!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Also, it seems you haven&#39;t noticed yet, so I&#39;m gonna tell ya. The princess over there caught something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The princess over there...?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Here you go! Hehe, I&#39;ve just caught another one.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Oh, look at you, staring at me with those “Don&#39;t eat me!” eyes... All right, all right.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I&#39;ll let you go, so don&#39;t get caught ever again, okay?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> That&#39;s what she&#39;s been doing for the whole time. Looks as if fish come willingly to get caught. So being unselfish is the secret of fishing after all?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t think ANY fish have “Eat me!” eyes, Marie...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait, something is wrong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Look at that bend of the rod!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Eek! Wh-What is...this...?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> A big one!? Let me give you a hand! I&#39;m coming right now, so hang in there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> We should help her out, too! It looks kind of fun!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I feel I&#39;ll be dragged into the river if I lose my concentration...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All together now! One, two, three!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Good! I see it now! One more should do it! Here we go now!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> It&#39;s a whopper of a fish!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Hmm... Definitely not “Don&#39;t eat me!” eyes. Would you say this one looks like it wants to eat us?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> What on earth have you reeled in!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I guess I&#39;ll hang around and help you look for food. After inviting you all out on that unsuccessful fishing trip, it&#39;s the least I can do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, thank you, Cú Chulainn. Your help means a lot to us.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> ...You know, the normal way to “procure food” is to hunt. So, let&#39;s go hunting!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> I see, so that&#39;s why you asked us to tag along.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> This&#39;ll be a walk in the park. ...Oh, Your Majesty. Why are you here?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It&#39;s useless asking me that question. Hunting is a knight&#39;s hobby. Especially since I am an Archer now. I will not let any prey escape me.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It would be perfect if my trustworthy horses Llamrei and Dun Stallion were here. My hound Cavall too.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Well, well, let&#39;s see how good you are then. Oh, I just got a glimpse of a deer in the lee of the mountain right over there.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> What shall we do? Should I have Mary chase the deer so I can shoot at it when it jumps out—</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> No, let me try this time around. I would like to warm up since I have not been hunting for a while.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Now, watch me.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Ex—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> !?!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Stop! Stooooop!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Don&#39;t you “what” me! What the hell are you doing?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Well. When your game hides in the lee of a mountain or a dense forest...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...then completely eradicating the surroundings would be one way to get at it, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It&#39;s not something I always do, you know? ...There are times when I need to, though. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Child of Light, am I breaking Celtic hunting etiquette in some way?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> This goes way beyond simple etiquette! No one bothered to bring it up to you?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Are you saying this is an absurd thing to do?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> When Agravain came with me on hunts, he would say with his lifeless eyes, “Impressive, Your Majesty. You certainly gave it your all.”</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Are you saying that was all just lip service?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, not lip service per se... How should I put it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wow, so ex(tra), much calibur... Nothing, I said nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wow, the king thinks big.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> A-Anyway, we should ban the use of Noble Phantasms. Let us deal with that deer.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Come on, Anne. It&#39;s hunting time!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Yes, ma&#39;am♪ Let&#39;s show everyone how skilled we are!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As expected of Altria! Birds... rabbits... you caught a lot!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Well, I did pretty good for a class I&#39;m not used to. You did a good job, too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Anne is good at shooting birds, too. I mean, out on the open sea, that&#39;s the only target there is.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> For the time being, this game should be enough.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So Anne and Mary shot the deer... That&#39;s wonderful. This was a good hunt!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I think all this should temporarily solve our problem with food shortage...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Cú Chulainn. Is that spear of yours an ornament? You looked like you slept through the whole thing.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Hmph. I was thinking about lending a hand, but I sniffed something out, so I was thinking about that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sniffed something out?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> See, here comes a big one. Looks like this is its hunting field, too!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Seeing as how we snatched its prey, it&#39;s not like we can slip away quietly.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I&#39;ll pay the hunting fees with a thrust of this spear!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sign:</strong></p><ul><li>The First Ever Happy BBQ Fiesta for Master Fujimaru &amp; Servants -</li></ul><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not opposed to the idea of having a barbecue, considering all the extra meat we got...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But still, that sign seems very unnecessary...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> No, no! What&#39;s important is the feel of it, the atmosphere!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hm. Meat roasted over rune fire sure has a unique taste... (munch munch)</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> We were wondering where you went, but didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be off hunting alone... So much for us running around.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She did come back with a huge deer on her back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes, and now we have so much meat we can&#39;t even finish...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She already noticed that we were short on food... She&#39;s so amazing...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh, Master... I cannot believe I did not notice you were starving. Shame on me.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> The next time you cannot bear your hunger any longer, will you please let me know?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I am prepared to give up this body anytime for you... I recommend my tail first.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> W-Well, there&#39;s still a lot of meat left right now!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> That is quite true. Then, here, Master. Please have some deer meat that I slowly roasted with my fire.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Say, “aah”...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> “Rune fire” this, “my fire” that... Such unfamiliar terms flying around...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess starting a fire is a simple task for those two.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Well, they are indeed very talented individuals.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> However, does the flavor actually differ depending on the fire used?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I did try to compare them, but with my unsophisticated palate I could not tell.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I agree...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> M-Maybe it&#39;s just the feel of it...?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Well then, how about something like this? Karna? (whisper whisper)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...Understood. If that&#39;s what the Master desires... I shall be glad to help.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> !!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Eye beams!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A real hero will roast meat with just their eyes!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hahaha. This would be charred meat, not chargrilled meat.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I tried to add to the types of fires, but dear me. “More than enough is too much,” I suppose.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...I miscalculated the temperature. I apologize, Master.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Hey! Do not waste food!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Oh, Martha has finally put up her fists! That stance isn&#39;t jujitsu... It must be some form of street fighting!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Why are you so happy about it!? I&#39;m not going to hit you just because you over-roasted some meat!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Really? Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...I apologize.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Nom, nom. I have to say, all of the meat tastes great.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> But, as a cooking method, barbecue is simply a bit too sloppy. Surely there&#39;s no denying that now?</p><h2 id="section-4-catcher-in-the-farm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-catcher-in-the-farm" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: &quot;Catcher in the Farm&quot;</h2><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fooou♪</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou is in a good mood too. Maybe Fou knows that we&#39;re going to harvest the crops.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Harvest... is a good civilization.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Heh heh, are you copying Altera, Senpai? It does seem like something she would say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Isn&#39;t it exciting?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. It has a nice ring, “Harvest.”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It took us a while to make them, but now that we have some crops, our line of produce has become stable.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Yes. However, there&#39;s a lot more work ahead for us. First of all, in farming, what&#39;s important is the nitrogen in the soil—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Scáthach can really become absorbed in things...)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> (Fou...)</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Hahaha. Your words tend to slip from my ears, queen of the Land of Shadows.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Knights like us couldn&#39;t do anything even if you told us about our grandmother&#39;s secret in farming.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> We can swing swords, but we knights couldn&#39;t swing a hoe right even if we wanted to. The most we could do is help out with the harvesting where it requires power.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Humph. It sounds as if you&#39;re calling me a babbling nitpicky old lady...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Am I correct, the guardian of Erin? I hope it was me mishearing things... but how about it?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Of course not, I would never. However, if that was how you took it, I am to blame.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I was told that I was not good at reading the room... Isn&#39;t that right, Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Yes... No, um... Yes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (He&#39;s struggling over the fact he can&#39;t confirm nor deny the claim!)</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> But Fionn mac Cumhaill, you are a hero of the Celt. I hear you hold some superior wisdom, do you not?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> As I mentioned earlier, farming is not my specialty.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I&#39;m sure if I think hard enough, I could find a way to maintain the crops. However, I did not think of using my thumb for this.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> If we were facing a serious matter where my wisdom was required, then I would not mind using my thumb of course.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hm. Well, if that happens, I&#39;ll look forward to it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, the crops have become an important asset to us. We&#39;d like to take good care of them.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is... Our crops have been destroyed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A... Another “bad civilization” matter!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Calm down, Master, Altera is not on this island!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What kind of monster would do this!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please calm down, Senpai. This island have nothing but monsters!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s completely destroyed. But more than half for sure... What happened?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> There are monsters near by! Is it them!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmm... I cast runes around the field so no beasts could bring harm to it. It is a mystery indeed.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Anyway, we need to rid the enemies before us. Let us investigate after we have defeated them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I&#39;ve cut the beast&#39;s bowel open, but I did not find our crops. The true culprit lies elsewhere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then what happened?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know. If only we had some clues...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Well then, let&#39;s search for some. We&#39;ll use them to investigate the cause of the damage and, if possible, rid ourselves of it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hm. Oh, yes. I know just the man for the job...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> That look... Hah, so it&#39;s already time to put my wisdom into use!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Very well. It is not something I usually openly show, but I guess it was meant to be.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Now, behold the wisdom that flows from within me.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Ohh... It is coming! The Noble Phantasm, said to have come from the oil that flicked onto the thumb of my master from the Salmon of Knowledge!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Fintan Finegas!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That pose... It must be...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thumb-sucking... Like a baby...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (...Don&#39;t laugh, don&#39;t laugh...)</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> It&#39;s here... It has come. My mind is becoming very clear!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hm!? This is... Yes, I can feel it!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> This is an extremely high DHA response! It&#39;s an unbelievably condensed DHA reaction not possible on Earth!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying myself, but the analyzing skill obtained from the Wisdom of Dún Scáith is telling me that!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Phew... Good. Everyone, salmon is very good. Let us all eat salmon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Normally, blue-backed fish contain a higher percentage of DHA than salmon. But what on earth is this... Salmon of Wisdom...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-Anyway, Fionn. Did you find anything?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Yes. First of all... we have firm evidence that some kind of beast destroyed our crops.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> A clear mind is sensitive to smell as well. The faint smell of an animal can support my claim.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> There is no mistake. The culprit is a beast, not a human. From the footprints, it is likely a four-legged beast.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou!? Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s all right, Fou, nobody thinks you&#39;re the culprit here.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> And also... Yes, I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> After analyzing everything, we&#39;re only left with one option.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wow! And what might that be?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Salmon DHA is just awesome...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Diarmuid, we must stay up and watch over this crop field. What came before will come again.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Say that again? ...Yes, my liege.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mean... act as a lookout?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Wait. Did you find out who the culprit was?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> No. I did not.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> The culprit is a beast. But I do not know what kind or where it is right now.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> So we have to see it with our own eyes... That&#39;s the answer my wisdom has led me to.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> My wisdom can help me solve mysteries, but it can&#39;t unconditionally tell me something completely unknown.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> If that were the case, I would have already known about this island or how to get back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well... that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Now wait a minute. You&#39;re thinking that was just a normal conclusion and that I didn&#39;t need to use my Noble Phantasm, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> ...Wrong. I did need to.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> We must stay up and watch over the crop field... That was the conclusion I came to after analyzing all the clues. That&#39;s the important part.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? I&#39;m sorry, I still don&#39;t understand...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Good grief. Then let me whisper it into your ear.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> There are many attractive, scantily clad women on this island. It&#39;s not just you and Lady Scáthach here.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> To be honest, I was thinking it&#39;s probably about time for me to run into some kind of lady trouble at night.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Therefore, I am doing this to also keep us away from the ladies and cool down for a bit. I think.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hey. Do you need help with the lookout?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Oh, no, leave this to the glorious Knights of Fianna.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I see. Then that&#39;s what we shall do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t really understand... But it seems Fionn and Diarmuid have their own troubles to deal with... I mean, their own way of showing consideration.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> For now, let&#39;s leave it to them for tonight, and come back tomorrow to take a look at the crops, Master.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> The night is through. I wonder if the field is all right.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I see, so that happened. How sad.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It&#39;s absolutely reprehensible that someone would destroy a field. It&#39;s a felony in my country. Someone is going to have to pay for this.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Master and I gazed into each others&#39; eyes while we worked on the crops, watching as the pistils and stamens came together...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> In other words, they were like our children! So to assault them like that... Unforgivable!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You wanted anyone who had some free time to come along, but is it really necessary for me to be here?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I know you&#39;re probably going to say it&#39;s part of a knight&#39;s duties to patrol one&#39;s territory, but...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...But I thought we said just the two of us... Maybe not... Eh, who cares anyway.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yep, it doesn&#39;t matter!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> With these numbers, we can handle anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Lots of people for a simple field visit...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> To be fair, we let Fionn and Diarmuid, two people with extensive combat experience, watch over the field.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...As such, this isn&#39;t about bolstering defenses. I think everyone just wants to check on the field since they have a stake in it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re almost there. Let&#39;s ask those two how things went last night.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> H-He&#39;s dead!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...It&#39;s a mortal wound. There&#39;s nothing we can do.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Looks like he&#39;s barely hanging in there. ...Hey! He&#39;s trying to say something!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s you... I&#39;ve made a grave mistake... If they got to me first, no amount of water would...help...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh... Fionn...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...And what about this one?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Diarmuid! Diarmuid Ua Duibhne! Get a hold of yourself!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Argh...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What&#39;s wrong!? Who could&#39;ve done this to a great warrior like yourself!?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...B...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> B?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...A b-boar...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fionn... Diarmuid...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This island has taken yet another life!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve confirmed the departure of both Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Their Spirit Origins are still intact, so I think you can just resummon them when we&#39;re back in Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> We can grieve later. Did you hear what he said with his dying words?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> If I&#39;m not mistaken... I think he said “boar.”</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yep, he did.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> That&#39;s what I heard as well.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Boar... As in the animal?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Who knows? The pig-looking mammal... That&#39;s the only kind of boar that came to my mind...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Hm? Over there!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...Oink!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...It&#39;s a boar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That it is. Just a regular boar. Cute, in fact...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So maybe we should call it a boar piglet?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...A boar piglet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master. A cute baby boar... That&#39;d make it a piglet.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hm. Piglet or not, it&#39;s still a boar. There&#39;s no question about that.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...Don&#39;t tell me that Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne were killed by this thing?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> That just can&#39;t be, can it? Look at it... So tiny and adorable.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> No. Unfortunately, we have all the evidence we need here. First, this is a crime scene.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Second, the dying Diarmuid even said himself that the culprit was a boar.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> We have no choice but to suspect the animal. It is the most basic rule of combat to not get fooled by your enemy&#39;s appearance.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I think it goes without saying, but boars are typically harmful to crops. Their existence won&#39;t be beneficial to us either way.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> That&#39;s true. You often hear of farmers trying hard to drive them off their lands.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Just because something&#39;s small, doesn&#39;t make it weak. You don&#39;t know until you try.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ... (tremble)</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Hey! Your scary glaring is making this little one frightened!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> It&#39;s okay, here, I have some nuts for you. Come on, come on... There&#39;s a good boy.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...O-Oink...?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Don&#39;t do it, Marie! You mustn&#39;t underestimate the strength of a charging boar!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It might just be a child, but it&#39;s got meaty... Yes, it&#39;s got meaty legs with a nice layer of fat on top!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> You need to be careful. We should all surround it and finish it off.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I agree. If this piglet really did violate the product of love that is our crops, our children, then... Heh, heh.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> We can&#39;t just let it get away, now, can we? How should we cook it? Medium? Rare? Well-done?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Come on! Just take a look at its eyes. They&#39;re beautiful eyes. This little one hasn&#39;t done anything wrong!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> You think so too, right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You have to punish it for its crimes.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> You&#39;re going to go that far too, Master? Boo...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Boar piglets sure are cute...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Right? Aren&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Oh! Of course! If there was something to feel guilty about, it would have run far away from here by now!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> The fact that it&#39;s sitting here like this is all the proof you need that it&#39;s innocent—</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> O... Oink!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What were you saying? It&#39;s running off at full speed!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What acceleration! I&#39;m not going to underestimate you, piglet!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...Hmm? There must be a reason for its flight.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GURRR...!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Monsters at a time like this!? The piglet must have been driven away by their stench and murderous aura!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> In any event, we can&#39;t let it get away with destroying our field. We&#39;ll pursue it once we take care of these beasts!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...“Split up and look for it,” huh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> This is a pretty big island. If we lost sight of it during the battle then who knows how far it&#39;s gone...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Father–I mean King Arthur–seriously works other people too hard. I guess he really doesn&#39;t understand people&#39;s feelings... Yep yep.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ya know what, I am done! What&#39;s the point of looking this hard anyway? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m gonna get rewarded or anything!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;m just gonna go back and say I couldn&#39;t find anything... Hmm?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What&#39;s that in the bushes?</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink...!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Looky here! Got ya!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ... (tremble)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ... (tremble tremble)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ... (Glance)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, so what? You know me or something?</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hah! If you don&#39;t then make sure you remember this name. I am the Treacherous Knight, Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> A disgusting order from a disgusting king... Of course I&#39;m gonna rebel against it!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink... (hug)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re surprisingly soft...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right! Feels great to ignore the king&#39;s orders! Maybe I&#39;ll head to the beach and ride some waves!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh yeah, I got some nuts from Marie to help lure out the target, but I don&#39;t need them at all.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I guess I&#39;ll get rid of them here.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink... (Sniff, sniff)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Someone or something might just find these and eat them, but oh well, I don&#39;t care. I suppose doing so will fill them up a bit, though...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t come to the field again, got that? Well, I&#39;m just talking to myself. See ya.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I see, I see... So that&#39;s what happened while I was relaxing on the beach.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I suppose that means I have no choice but to help you watch the field.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I don&#39;t know a lot about how things work on land, but can&#39;t we just harvest the rest of the crops?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> We might be able to do that now, but if our next patch of crops also gets eaten then we&#39;ll be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> We either need to eliminate the root cause completely... Or come up with a solid defense.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> So we need to think about the future, huh? That makes sense, I guess.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> It&#39;s true, we can&#39;t ignore this issue. Although I do question your story about how those two got defeated by boars...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Exactly. I still don&#39;t believe these little ones are the culprits. I am here to prove that.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I&#39;ll tell you again: you shouldn&#39;t underestimate boars. I remember there was once a terrifying boar in Britain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I just remembered. The reason Diarmuid died in his legend was also...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Gored by a boar... So it&#39;s his second time, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He&#39;s famous for being a hero killed by boars...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...No. For the sake of Diarmuid&#39;s honor, let&#39;s not talk about things we can&#39;t be sure about.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s not certain that he really was killed by a boar, anyway.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Hmm... I was just thinking about Cú Chulainn&#39;s face when he said, “I&#39;m going to protect our base. You handle the field.”</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Did you see it?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Yeah. He had a sad look in his eyes.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> It&#39;s like they were saying, “If I, a fellow Celtic male, were to defeat that boar... it would cause him great shame...”</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> He may look violent, but he can be quite nice... And compared to him, that stupid samurai...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> “A boar? It doesn&#39;t clone itself, or go backwards in time, or split space or anything like that, right?”</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> “I&#39;m not interested in it at all.”</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> He doesn&#39;t care about his friends at all, does he!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...Everyone, enough talking. Something&#39;s getting closer.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...I&#39;m certain it&#39;s something that wants to destroy this symbol of the love between Master and me.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hmm. So it&#39;s here, huh?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Even a fancy lady like me can be a little bit of a wild animal at night!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> In other words... it&#39;s hunting time. Let&#39;s get rid of this pest!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I knew it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But I believed in you...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s wrong, Fou? I know you&#39;re excited to be around another small animal, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait? Huh?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> There&#39;s more than one!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh my! They&#39;re even cuter when there&#39;s more of them!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Yes! I smell blood in the water! ...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Wait. Something seems strange.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> They&#39;re all lining up on top of each other...It&#39;s as if they&#39;re protecting our field, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wait! Something else is here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Something jumped out and knocked down the wall of boar piglets!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Grwaaffhh!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Well, well... It&#39;s a demon boar. A regular boar with a demon inside.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...A demon boar?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that what attacked Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It&#39;s very likely, Master.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> From the looks of it, it has enough power to be a match for a Servant.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> If they were caught off guard, even the two Knights of Fianna could be defeated.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It looks like it wants to eat us!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Do you see now why I told you not to underestimate boars, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Demon boars... They don&#39;t show up as often as dragons, but they are common creatures in heroes&#39; stories.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Indeed. Demon boars are trials for a hero. Heroes who aren&#39;t strong enough are killed without mercy.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I used to send my own students up against them all the time.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> They&#39;re a very eco-friendly enemy, because you can eat them once they&#39;re dead.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> The one in front of us right now has a little too much fat to be a good opponent, though...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh... no! Stop bullying them, you meanie!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Marie went to fight it! We have to go, too!</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong> GRRRRAAAARGH...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Look at those scraps of food around its mouth. Those are from our field, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It seems the thing that ransacked our field just confessed.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And it looks like it wants to eat us, too!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Bring it on! If it wants a fight I&#39;ll smash it into the freaking sky! ...Uh, I mean... yeah.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Unfortunately, I must resist against your act of violence. The reward for sinning is death, haven&#39;t you heard?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Begone! If you will not, I will show you a new meaning to “Bible thumping”!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It&#39;s quite powerful, however...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Hahh!</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong> GRRRRAAAARGH... GRRRAAAARTHUR...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...? Did it just...? Did I imagine that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good work, everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s the end for that boar!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Hehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, nothing. I was just thinking how that&#39;s something the doctor would say...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It just reminded me... I haven&#39;t heard his voice in a long while.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, no. It isn&#39;t anything that serious. I mean, we will be off the island soon anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really, he just popped into my head somehow, that&#39;s all... In any event, we were able to protect the field, so we have no problems here.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Yes, Mash. It was pretty strong, but I&#39;m glad we won. To think there are boars like that on this island...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...I am sorry, Marie. You were correct.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I have to apologize too. We jumped to conclusions and assumed the boar piglets were the culprits.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Knowing you&#39;re wrong and not admitting to it is the same as lying. And I hate lying.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Hehehe. It doesn&#39;t bother me.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> And if you&#39;re going to apologize, apologize to the little ones you chased... Huh?</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink, oiiiink!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh my! Oh my! Hehehe!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s right... You were protecting our crops from the demon boar, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> You knew you couldn&#39;t win, and you still tried your hardest anyway... Why?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Probably because you gave them food yesterday, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That demon boar must&#39;ve been preventing them from getting any food. They would&#39;ve been starving.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So they felt like they owed you one... Hah. It&#39;s like they&#39;re knights or something, huh?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> They seem to like you, too.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wh-Whatever! I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about! Go on, get lost! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmm... Still, boar piglets are wild animals. They&#39;re a threat to our crops, too.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink oink!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> But look. It seems like they kind of understand human speech.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> We may not have to exterminate them after all; we can use them instead. Let me try this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s she doing, crouching down in front of them like that?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...The deal is made. The contract is sealed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Y-You can talk to them!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> All I&#39;m doing is imitating Animal Communication. The most I can do is get the general feeling.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> It&#39;s similar to what you do with that white creature.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, I kind of get the feeling that I can understand what Fou says... sometimes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What do you mean by “contract”?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> They will leave our field alone. And when we&#39;re not here, they&#39;ll watch over it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> If another threat like that demon boar shows up, they&#39;ll tell us immediately. They&#39;ll be a warning system.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> In exchange, we&#39;ll give them food. ...What do you say, Master? We can still call the whole thing off...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sounds good to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They&#39;re our new friends on this island.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh my! I think that&#39;s wonderful! That means I can pet them all I want, right?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I&#39;m all right with it too.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Giant boars who eat our crops are one thing, but little boar piglets? I&#39;m willing to leave them alone.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Me? I... I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s your decision, Master. Don&#39;t ask me.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink! Oink♪</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> So instead of watchdogs, we&#39;ve got watch-boars? I&#39;m okay with that.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> A ship without rowers isn&#39;t going anywhere, they say.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> If Anne and you are okay with it, Master, then so am I.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> (...It makes me feel so much safer to have a ready source of protein nearby...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes, we&#39;ve made some very cute friends.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> (He did say, after all, that there were no forbidden foods. If it comes down to it... I don&#39;t have a choice, do I...?)</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...Oink?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Of course, little Tamamo-chan wants whatever her Master wants! But...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. There&#39;s one thing I want to make clear...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...Foxes prey on boar piglets.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> At certain times, and in certain conditions... for example, if I was starving and one of them was defenselessly waddling right past me...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I might suddenly find my mouth filled with delicious meat juice! Mmm, so good... I&#39;d better share this with Master... (Gasp!)</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Something like that might happen, so do be careful, okay?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> You see, I&#39;m in summer mode right now, so I&#39;m even more elegant and more of a beast than usual!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> O-Oink...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. I should apologize to you.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Boar piglet, I apologize for chasing you for a crime you didn&#39;t commit.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Your courage when you fought that huge boar was real. You deserve praise.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Altria...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I hope we&#39;ll get along.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Don&#39;t be ashamed because the demon boar was oppressing you. You are wonderful.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Yes, even if your bodies are tiny, you&#39;re courageous, quick, wonderfully furry, and... and...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...And strangely enough, just looking at you makes me hungry.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...Oiiiiinkkkkk!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh, jeez! They ran away again... You mustn&#39;t scare them like that.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I just said what I was honestly thinking when I saw them, and...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Either way, our field is safe now. Let&#39;s get back to work.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is there a problem?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s eat when we get back.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> N-No, Master! I don&#39;t just think about food all the time.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I was just thinking that this island is huge. There may be more than one boar.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> This might not be the end.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I hope I&#39;m wrong, but please keep that in mind—</p><h2 id="section-5-island-detox" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-island-detox" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: &quot;Island Detox&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve got a small elite force today, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You said there was something we had to check... What did you mean, Scáthach?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s due to a report from that one over there.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Me?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...No, the one in your arms.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink, oink.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou. Foou. Foou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Fou sounds kind of sad...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Fou sounds kind of upset...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe he feels like he&#39;s been replaced...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmm. Don&#39;t worry, Fou. That&#39;ll never happen.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Here, come sit in my arms.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> What did this little one say?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> That something strange has been happening on this island. I couldn&#39;t just ignore that information.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Somehow I always manage to scare the piglets away just by looking at them.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> It&#39;d be quite troublesome to have my guide always run away from me, obviously. That&#39;s why I brought you here.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I see... You are very beautiful, but you always have this stern look on your face.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just how warriors and knights are, but you&#39;re wearing a swimsuit now. You should smile.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She said what we&#39;re all thinking!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was thinking the same thing... Somehow she still has a very intimidating look even though she&#39;s in a swimsuit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess Scáthach will be the same no matter where she goes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Also, I think she&#39;s still treating the boar piglets like some kind of vermin...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But I like it. I want her to glare at me.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Is that how it works?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...You&#39;re the Queen of the Land of Shadows.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> With the amount of responsibility you have, I think you&#39;d be much better off smiling more.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh... Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;ve never ruled a nation? Would I be more like you if I did?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> It&#39;s just who I am... There&#39;s nothing I can do. I was, after all, a gatekeeper.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> The Land of Shadows gets all kinds of nasty visitors. It was my job to drive them away.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Besides, there are different kinds of queens out there. Medb, for example, is more similar to you than me.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Medb looks like she&#39;s having fun every day. I actually quite like her.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> But all her talk about love... might just be a little too difficult for me to understand...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> By the way, what am I doing here? I mean, if I have a role to play, I don&#39;t mind, but still...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Oh, there may be something I want to ask you to do. You might be better suited for it than me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Better suited for it... Do you mean something that needs bare hands, not a spear?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I see... So someone you want to hurt, but not kill... Yes. We shall not commit murder.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Or maybe it&#39;s a holy oil death match, where you&#39;re not allowed to use weapons...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Hehe... I can&#39;t wait...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Looks like we&#39;re close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can smell something in the wind... A pungent, rotten odor. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink-oink!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I see. So that&#39;s it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A poisonous-looking... puddle?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s a damage zone...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s only about the size of a manhole... but it&#39;s causing all the plants in the area to wilt.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s where the stench is coming from, too.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Master, you&#39;ll probably be okay, but don&#39;t breathe too much in.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> That&#39;s poisonous ground. The miasma from it could rot a normal person&#39;s lungs.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> So this is what the boar piglets told us about, huh? But where did it come from?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh... There are enemies nearby. Think they&#39;re the cause?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> No, the miasma probably just brought them here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;re all ones we&#39;ve seen before anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I don&#39;t think any of them could have created this poison.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s the cause, you think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> For now, we need to get rid of them before we can look into this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s chase them off, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I see, so that&#39;s why you brought me here. You want me to purify this place.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I don&#39;t know if it can be done, but let me try. First I&#39;ll sprinkle a little holy water...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Hmm, how about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s amazing! The poisonous puddles are disappearing... The stench in the air is clearing up too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nice purification!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How much do you charge for your holy water, Martha?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I can give you as much as you want, but what&#39;s more important is faith.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Without faith, the water is meaningless.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouu!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Obviously, a withered plant could not be revived. Unfortunate as it is...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> But something else will take root again in this place now, and surely bloom.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> That poisonous ground was meant to molder the island&#39;s land. It was fortunate that we could purify it this early.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I feared that, if neglected, the island would have transformed into a land of death that could not grow a single weed in the end.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> At the very least, this island is rich in its natural resources. I cannot see them all gone to waste.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...I can&#39;t believe this. Not only are you asking others to take care of the monsters for you, you&#39;re even asking the same people to take care of your environment?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I don&#39;t know if the ruler has forgotten about this island or just abandoned it, but I just added one more entry to the list of items I want to complain about.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Huh? Where are you going, little one?</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Hoink, oink! ...Oi?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Selfish behavior will only lead to your own demise. What are you after? Tell me, look me in the eyes and spit everything out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Er, pointing your spear is a bit excessive, no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t be a hero that kills with your eyes!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...Ugh! How base of me. I still have the notion that boars are vermin. Well, they actually are, but...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oi...oi!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouu. Fou, Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no... Not you too, Fou! I&#39;ll go after them.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...? Oh, I see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Judging from Fou&#39;s behavior, it doesn&#39;t look like the boar piglet was trying to flee.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems there&#39;s another place the piglet wanted to take us to. In other words, another place plagued by the poison.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!? Fou... (Blech)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh... What&#39;s going on here!? The miasma has spread wider than the previous place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The entire area has been completely transformed into a poisonous swamp!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> How terrible! The air in the Palace of Versailles was considerably poisonous, but this is even worse.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> To accumulate this much poison... What!? Ya wanna mess with a holy maiden!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...Keep your voice down. Be cautious, we are not the only ones here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah. An eerie dripping sound...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I have another bad feeling about this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, take a look over there, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can see something rolling in the swamp. Could it be some animal that was affected by the miasma?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> No, that&#39;s not it...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> A demon boar! They&#39;re still around!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> That must be a mud bath. Something boars do to remove the dirt and parasites from their bodies.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> That place is called a marshy field. Those conditions are said to be the etymology for the expression “writhe in agony” in the Far East.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> S-So knowledgeable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Tell me more! Ms. Scáthach!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> If the poisonous swamp created the marshy field for that thing... Wait, it&#39;s the opposite. It was that rolling around on the ground that created the swamp.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> The puddle we ran into earlier was a mere coincidence.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> This is the real thing. That monster will come back here again and again. I guess you can call this place its favorite bathtub.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Either way, poison is produced from that thing&#39;s body right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In that case, the true culprit behind this land of poison, the one the boar piglets wanted to show us was...</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong> Grr... Grrrph!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It noticed me!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmm, a demon boar that releases poison from its body...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I won&#39;t say anything if you catch prey or do something else with that.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> However, I cannot overlook how you&#39;ve ruined and eroded this island, since that is an act that violates our lives here.</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong> Grr, grrrph!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong> Ghhhaa...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It could be problematic if there are more boars like that who can produce miasma and corrupt this island...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eventually we might have to do this all over again.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oinkkyy...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> All right then. First let&#39;s do something about this impure swamp first. Here&#39;s some holy water, then...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> What!? I can&#39;t purify it!? My prayers haven&#39;t been heard, hmm!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Ahem. Sorry you had to see that. It seems I didn&#39;t pray enough to prove my faith.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s because I was using the coastal rocks as punching bags to train myself...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And ended up changing the landscape a bit because I was going at it too hard... Please forgive me...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> In other words, you can&#39;t make this place beautiful again?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> The previous one was rather small in scale, but this one&#39;s corrosion is too severe... I can&#39;t get rid of it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If it&#39;s impossible for Martha...searching for a different way isn&#39;t going to help...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmm... Yes, it will be difficult, but it&#39;s better than doing nothing. Here, let me help.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I happen to have these ash tree seeds with me. I&#39;ll make it so that they grow by absorbing the poison in the ground.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Those seeds will clean up the surface, you say? How wonderful!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oiiink!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> The effects won&#39;t be immediate, though. As Martha said, the poison is deep.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Plants also take large amounts of time to grow strongly. If you rush things, they will lose to the miasma and quickly wither away.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> They need to carefully absorb each drop of poison, slowly but surely. It&#39;ll take a long, long time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Exactly how long is a “long, long time”?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Well, roughly 1,000 years?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s long!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> But, in that case, the land will eventually be able to return to its original state.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Only the next best strategy can be taken if nothing can be done immediately.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> If we combine her holy water with these seeds, we&#39;ll at least be able to prevent the poisonous swamp from expanding any more than now.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Right. It&#39;s better than doing nothing, surely. We may not be around anymore at that time though.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Since we&#39;re guests here, it would be a form of giving back to the island, no? To take back its future, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I think that&#39;s a wonderful prospect.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Then, let&#39;s get to work. It&#39;ll be our first job; one worth commemorating later.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmm. It would be safe to say that there are still demon boars around.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Fortunately, however, we still have a few ash tree seeds.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> If we find more poisonous swamps like this, or more other demon boars that produce them,</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> we&#39;ll need to deal with them in the future too. Try not to miss any, Master...!</p><h2 id="section-6-village" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-village" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: &quot;Village&quot;</h2><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Phew, playing with beach balls is fun, but I&#39;m a bit tired.

What is for dinner tonight?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Dammit, how am I supposed to behave? To think we&#39;d be in the same space... (glance)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Of course, I meant that person is such an eyesore. I totally mean it!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Arrgh, I&#39;m just gonna go clear up my head a little bit.

Heh heh...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...Hmm? What is with this feeling of excitement?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Perhaps it&#39;s the sea, the beach, and the shining sun. This is rare indeed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It appears that everyone is starting to get used to life on this island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At first, everything was inconvenient and everyone was feeling dissatisfied, but maybe now all the hard work has finally paid off.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> However... something strange has been happening. Would you listen to me, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Please grace us with your wise words!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I-I&#39;d rather you not be that formal with me all the time.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> If you ain&#39;t joking, then I&#39;ll really make you my lackey! ...Um, ahem, where was I?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> It seems the men are acting a bit strange. See, over there.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Did you see that? Those two whispering over there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The two of them disappear a lot lately... right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hmm. Not just those two. The other men tend to disappear a lot too.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I noticed that too, but I&#39;ve been letting it slide. After all, they&#39;ve all done their fair share of work.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> (Emphatically) I didn&#39;t notice anything at all! I was looking at my Master the whole time!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> In that case... what shall we do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s tail them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s ask them what they are doing. Right now.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Mmm, yeah... They might play stupid and pretend not to know anything... so let&#39;s just follow them for the time being.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Count me in. If they dare go against the teachings of God, I will punish them... despite the fact that they&#39;re also castaways.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> That&#39;s right, this is not about us being nosy. We&#39;re simply taking a peek into what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s a holy and sacred act of confirmation!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You know, that just makes you sound even more nosy...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re moving deeper and deeper into the island...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Looks like they&#39;re trying not to get noticed. That can only mean... they are trying to do something suspicious...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Let&#39;s be cautious. We can follow their trail even if we lose visual. More importantly, we don&#39;t want them to find out they&#39;re being stalked.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> There must be a reason for them to be this secretive...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I don&#39;t want to know what would happen if they found out that we are...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t scare me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re all allies... RIGHT!?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> You&#39;re too naive! Even more naive than a baby!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I&#39;ve been paying attention to see if there are any traps along the way and here you are, being naive.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Listen, Master. Don&#39;t you ever underestimate the lengths which men with a guilty conscience will go to.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You are exactly right. Yes, they will run away... lie to you... It truly is... terrible...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I&#39;m getting chills down my spine!)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Somehow I&#39;ve lost sight of them. It&#39;s not like we can&#39;t track them anymore, but there&#39;s one problem...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Even if there are no traps, it looks like there is a gatekeeper... You there! Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Come out, whoever you are! I know you are there!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I see... very impressive. Then allow me to show myself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-This voice is...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> This voice... It can&#39;t be...!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> My name is... Island Mask!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Oh. No. Who. Can. It. Be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What are you doing, Mr. Swallow Reversal?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> My name is Island Mask. I have no relationship with that refined swordsman and renowned gatekeeper.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Oh, um, okay. Look.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> You can call yourself whatever you want. I don&#39;t care.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> But that getup... It&#39;s basically a sign that I can punch your face in until your mask breaks, right?</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong> Hahaha. Only you, Lady Martha, would get that kind of impression upon seeing this mask!</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong> Unfortunately, it&#39;s something that I borrowed, so I must ask you not to break it. And while I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ll add that I&#39;d rather you not punch me with those gauntlets of yours.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I see. Well then I&#39;ll aim solely for your stomach. I&#39;ll punch it so hard you won&#39;t be able to digest anything for three days. Just think of it as fasting.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong> So it has come to this. I suppose you are a holy maiden who educates others with an iron fist.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong> Well, be that as it may, a gatekeeper must perform his duty.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong> You may only go through once you have defeated me... That is what I am trying to say.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong> I am the great forest incarnate. An enigma. My existence transcends good and evil, and so forth.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong> In short, do not hold back on me. Come, Lady Martha, come at me!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> So, seeing me in my swimsuit, all out of control, has made him lose control as well?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> What a sinful holy maiden you are! You must be kind of be happy to be that sought after?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Huh? Well, um... Maybe this bikini is a little too attractive?</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong> Oh no, I do not desire you in any way. What I truly desire is the armored dragon Tarasque, you know?</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong> Now, hurry! Bring that towering and intimidating Tarasque before me... HURRY! (Excited)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> That does it! I won&#39;t pull any punches! I will face you as if I am facing an angel!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> As you wish! The emptiness of conflict... I will hammer that concept into your bones with this iron fist!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong> Boss! Why are you getting all salty with me too!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh, sorry, Tarasque. I sorta lost my cool and kinda went with it. Sorry, tee hee☆</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No. Way. It&#39;s. Sasaki. Kojirou. (Deadpan)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Island Mask, defeated!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> ...Hah. Heh heh. Well well, I&#39;ve lost. I&#39;ve lost to you completely.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Satisfied? Now I&#39;ll ask you again... What were you trying to do?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> As the victor... I mean, as the one preaching God&#39;s words on the emptiness of conflict, I think I have the right to ask.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I... I...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I WANTED TO PLAY, TOO!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Huh!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Come again?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> It&#39;s summer! We&#39;re on a deserted island! As someone who appreciates elegance, of course I wanted to enjoy this occasion!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I was thinking it should be okay for me to go wild for a bit... But unlike you, my friends...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I was not given the privilege to go wild in a swimsuit!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Why, you ask? Because I am a mere 1-star Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I feel like I just heard something I shouldn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Therefore I was left with no other choice but to transform and add excitement to the occasion. That was the purpose of the mask... you know? YOU KNOW?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> By the way, where did that mask come from...?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Heh. You would know nothing about it, my Master... About the zealous union of us common Heroic Spirits! The 1 Star Alliance!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> This mask was handed to me by Lord Amadeus. He told me to use it “if something comes up.”</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Lady Martha&#39;s fist shattered it...but it was the symbol of our determination...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see... I&#39;m just glad it wasn&#39;t Spartacus&#39;s mask...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Fine. I do understand that you wanted to vent your frustration and regret...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> However, let me ask you one more time. Why did you get in our way?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> The men that went on ahead weren&#39;t common rarity, right? In that case, you didn&#39;t have the obligation to help them, now did you?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hmm. I asked them to hire me since I thought it&#39;d be a nice chance for Island Mask to play a part...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> But I think it would be easier for me to show you what I mean rather than tell you.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> A defeated gatekeeper has no choice. I will show you the way.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> ...We might run into some monsters along the way, but that won&#39;t pose any issue for you, now will it, Master?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Huh? Hey, bodyguard, what are you doing? Why the hell would you bring them here?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I apologize. I was having too much fun fighting and I lost.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Tch. Well, it was only a matter of time until they found out about this place...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-This is...!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> This place...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There are buildings...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> And a crop field...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right, Master. It&#39;s on a smaller scale... but it looks just like our village.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Well, the cat&#39;s out of the bag now. This is a village created just for the men.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> They got buildings and even a crop field. Although the direction they went in is slightly different than ours.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hmm... Hmmmmm... This place is more organized than I thought. Some structures are even built better than ours...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I do feel like we&#39;ve lost a game...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But why would you hide this place?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> It has to be hidden. You see, boys do like their little secret bases, right?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Although the place you guys got there is getting a lot more convenient than here.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Either way, Diarmuid, Fionn, and I talked about how building a village with our own hands would also serve as good training.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> And so, even with those guys gone, we&#39;ve decided to continue building this place in secret.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> How should I put it... Fionn said it best...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> It makes us feel nervous when there are girls in swimsuits around all the time.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Uncle Fergus, on the other hand, would&#39;ve loved that place. He&#39;d do as he pleased, without a care in the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see... Does this village have a name?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Hmm? Well, it&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Both Fionn and Diarmuid entrusted their dying wish to us.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> In order to honor the noble Lancers who built this place, we call it... “Backspear Village.”</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Heh heh. I am just a farmer with a hoe, a support member if you will.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...So a spin on your boy band name.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Hahaha, that&#39;s a funny joke you got there.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Still, if even the ever-calm Karna would go wild with the base, we might be able to create some good tunes there.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> I will shred the bassline like a wild beast–whatever that means–and tear into my Master&#39;s enemies.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> It&#39;s just a joke. Well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a version of me who&#39;s in a band somewhere.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> But that&#39;s a different me, and a different Backspear Boys.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> We are the summer edition of Backspear, and we&#39;ll be burning up the charts all summer long!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I feel like Cú Chulainn is just blurting nonsense right now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All I got is that the men here are really enjoying themselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This place is their haven, their paradise. Let&#39;s leave it alone for now.</p><h2 id="section-7-tusk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-tusk" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: &quot;Tusk&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve gathered a lot of materials.

Prayers and beliefs? That&#39;s where I come in! I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s obvious what kind of statue we want to build, right?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Well, Master will have the final decision.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> It&#39;s too embarrassing to see my own statue, so no thanks.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Although, if Master were to secretly carve a small wooden bust of me and sleep with it every night... Ehehehe, just thinking about it makes me excited.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That statue would serve the same purpose as a war god statue right? In that case, shouldn&#39;t we base it on the most powerful one here?

That should do it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We... we finished! We finally finished the escape ship, Master!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Foou!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It was a pretty long, hard journey. I have no other way to describe it.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I think it&#39;s a good ship. Although we really won&#39;t know how she handles the sea until we take her out.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about who&#39;ll take the helm either. You can leave that to us.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> This time I am going on a cruise with Master... Romance on the high seas... Hee hee hee...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh that reminds me! We have to do that at the bow! What was it...? Right, that Titanic thing!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Come on, let&#39;s do that together, dear! Oh, you don&#39;t have to embarrassed about it!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wouldn&#39;t it be cooler if we stuck some metal plates onto this thing? Some horns...or maybe spikes?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I guess our fun vacation is about to end.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh well, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m sure the image of my beautiful summer self has been seared into my Master&#39;s mind.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Once we&#39;re back in Chaldea, I will activate my secret move: Tamamo Subliminal Message! Master won&#39;t be able to rest again without seeing swimsuits!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Hmm? Hehe, the boar piglets seem to be happy for us.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink, oink, oink!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Well. It&#39;s almost as if they are all clapping. Thank you...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Say, Scáthach? Can&#39;t these little ones ride with us?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Impossible. I didn&#39;t design this ship with their numbers in mind.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> I&#39;ve cast runes on the ship&#39;s body so it may adapt to all kinds of situations. However, that means it also required very delicate magical adjustments.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> We won&#39;t be able to set sail with them onboard.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Is that so... Too bad...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...Oink...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> But that big demonic boar is still on this island, right? If we leave these little ones here...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They might be attacked.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They might not be able to live safely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. That possibility does exist. I would have liked to rid them of that problem, but... well...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmph. Would you look at that. The solution came to us.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> —Grrrrrrrrrrrrrfffffffffff!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Back for more?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> But look, the wound we inflicted earlier hasn&#39;t healed yet.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> We can do it now. We just might be able to kill it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If we jump aboard right now,we can finally leave this place...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...But...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We owe a lot to these boar piglets.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> ...Hah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s fight! For the peace of this island!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Heh... I expected nothing less from ya!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Well said, Master.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> The Knights of the Round Table are not assembled, my beloved hound Cavall is not here, there&#39;s no army under my command...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> But nevertheless, for the briefest of moments, this island was our kingdom... And those little ones behind us were its people.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> How can I call myself a king... without fighting for the people!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrfffffffff!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh... It&#39;s so strong!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GRRRR, GRRRRRRRRRRFFFF!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> My my, I&#39;m amazed at its stubbornness.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Ugh... I expected it to be strong, but... to think it would have such incredible stamina...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I thought I was used to exterminating monsters... Could I be getting weaker?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmm. It&#39;s quite a tough enemy. Its presence here... must mean that, yes, this—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GGGRRRR... GRR?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That glance... What&#39;s it looking at? ...Oh no! The escape ship!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GRRRR, GRRRRRRRRRRFFFF!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s charging! Damn it, this is bad!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s so fast...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ll never make it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That charge will destroy the ship on impact!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh no. We won&#39;t make it in time—</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> O...Oiiiinnnk!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The boar piglets... They&#39;re forming a wall!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...“Formed” a wall, you mean. The demonic boar bowled them all over, but at least now it&#39;s changed course!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> The ship&#39;s safe!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GRRRRRFFFFFFF!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> O-Oink!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;ve made another barricade!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh no... Over and over again...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Look at how many poor piglets have been knocked out cold... Still, thanks to them, at least we made it in time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re in position now! Leave it to us!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oi...nk...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Even with your combined strength, there was no way you could have defeated such a huge beast...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> You knew that, didn&#39;t you? ...And yet you still protected our ship.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Silly piglets... Had the boat been destroyed, we could have been together a little more.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Mr. Big Boar. Sorry— Most likely, there&#39;s no place here for you.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> This is their island.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GRRRRFFFF...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Yeah... I know. You&#39;re big and they&#39;re small.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> You both eat to survive, and then eventually you die. You&#39;re both the same animal.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> So why do they get the island, not you? You&#39;re thinking how unfair it is, right?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...I know how you feel, but I can tell you exactly why.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Because they&#39;re weak, they&#39;re short-lived. And because they surely can&#39;t oppose your strength.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> We are strong and have the power to protect them, so that is what we will do. Our purpose is to protect the weak.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Yes. In a word, I suppose that&#39;s just my selfishness.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> The weak die out, and those with power control the land. It&#39;s like that everywhere.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...But you know what? I&#39;m Marie Antoinette.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I&#39;m known as the most selfish girl in the world!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GR...GRRR... GRRRFFFF!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is the end, Master. Let&#39;s finish him off!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> Gugh... Oooooo!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-We did it! It stopped moving and it&#39;s sinking to the bottom of the ocean!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Counterattack successful! Nice work, Master.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Hmm. I guess even a big boar like that isn&#39;t enough to kill me. Not like death by boar is a common occurrence, anyway...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...O-Oink...oink.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Ah. Yes, that&#39;s right. Everything will be fine now. That big bully&#39;s gone.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink, oink.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouu.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Oh no. Fou&#39;s got that “Don&#39;t replace me!” look in his eyes again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-It&#39;s okay, Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m looking at you in celebration of our victory, just like always!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou? Foufou.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> At first I was thinking to myself, “How inconvenient. What kind of island is this?”</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Now it actually feels nostalgic. Who knew I&#39;d be this emotional...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re right...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ve grown quite attached to this island.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s amazing.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I guess that&#39;s because we all put in the effort to make this place easy for us to live in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Marie, it&#39;s time to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Yes, I understand. It is quite regrettable but...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t cry like that. Please live a happy life here.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> From your perspective, we may have very well ruined this island with all the things we built...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> However, please feel free to enjoy the food and all that in the field. If you feel like it, you can even do something new with all of it.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Oink...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...Oiiinnnk! Oii!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Farewell! It was fun!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> ...Oi...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s kind of sad with them not around, huh?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Is that so? I&#39;m... I&#39;m fine...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Here&#39;s hoping they have a happy life.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Yes. I pray that island becomes a tropical paradise for those little ones.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> However, it seems we still have a problem. The ship has been rocking really hard. Is it really going to be okay?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> It was the best ship I could build with the alloted time. It is properly protected by runes as well. No need to worry.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...Perhaps you were questioning our skills at the wheel? Just so you know, the ship&#39;s running fine.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> We haven&#39;t really decided what course it will take, though.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> No worries. I am sure we will reach somewhere if we just sail straight ahead.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You just say whatever you want, don&#39;t you? Is that compass even working? Lying is not good, you know?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> At any rate, we have plenty of food stored up. Since nothing is more important than food, I made sure of that personally.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I don&#39;t mind where we end up. Just as long as it allows us to contact Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right. Let me try right now. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we could already.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t even know when we&#39;ll be able to get in touch with them again? Man, now this is gonna be a long voyage...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Well, we&#39;ve had our relaxing island vacation, so why not an elegant ocean vacation next?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> You people are still gonna be in swimsuits, yeah? We know how to take a hint...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> It means we men are still supporting roles. We&#39;ll be good and sit on the sidelines.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I already had enough fun on that island in my own way.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Perhaps I will quietly stay in my cabin and play hanafuda.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> The Japanese card game? Hm, for some reason I remember playing it. Yeah, that&#39;ll help us kill some time.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> So there you have it. You probably won&#39;t see us again until we&#39;re back in Chaldea. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll behave.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hehe... Maybe Tamamo has the right attitude.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If there&#39;s no way of knowing when we&#39;ll reach land, why even worry about it at all?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As long as we just relax and enjoy ourselves on this ship, like we did on the island, then we may not have a problem.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, is there anything you want to do out in the open waters?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fish, I guess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, we did a lot of fishing back on the island... But you&#39;re right. Saltwater fishing would be a different experience entirely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I wonder what kind of fish we&#39;ll catch...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess... we can pretend we&#39;re pirates.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> What? Don&#39;t tell me, Master... You always wanted to be a pirate?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Why didn&#39;t you tell me earlier!? Very good, very good!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Hehe, I will teach you everything about being a pirate personally! Very personal, day and night!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hey you two, at least one of you, focus on steering the ship!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouu.</p><h2 id="brilliant-summer-going-out-with-tamamo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brilliant-summer-going-out-with-tamamo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Brilliant Summer - Going Out With Tamamo -</h2><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Lalala!

Ask away!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...Our destination? Oh, nowhere fancy... I think about here will do, even...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> All right.

This setup is...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fouuuu♪</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is a picnic...right?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Why yes, it is something like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Come to think of it, I&#39;m hungry.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> That&#39;s perfect! Now don&#39;t be shy. Come! Come!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> It&#39;s not every day you get to have a picnic, so I kind of went all out in the kitchen... Dig in!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wow... There are so many dishes here you normally wouldn&#39;t see back at the base!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You are good at this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Looks delicious!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hehehe, I figured you already know this but I&#39;ve been training night and day to become a good wife!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I&#39;ve been taking cooking lessons as well, so hopefully I&#39;ve properly displayed those skills.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> You see, my cooking teacher Uzume-chan and I have been friends since the events of the Kojiki, one of Japan&#39;s oldest legends.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> She thus possesses the necessary culinary knowledge to survive in the wild like this. And so, figuring a day like this would come...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...I asked her to teach me how to be self-sufficient and cook dishes that would win my dear Master&#39;s heart!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> When it comes to what can be eaten or not, Scáthach might know a thing or two, HOWEVER...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I am confident that I am better at turning those ingredients into a delicious dish.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Now come try these acorn cookies. There&#39;s bread made from acorn flour too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you eat acorns?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Not normally, no. Their high toxicity produces a bitter, astringent sensation.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> There ARE some kinds you can eat directly, though. As for the others... well, you can get by as long as you get rid of the astringency.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see... This is really educational.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> This here is tochi mochi, made with Japanese horse chestnut. Of course, it too needs to have its harsh taste removed.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh, and this is some tea made from a unique blend of medicinal herbs I gathered myself. It&#39;s delicious and healthy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is amazing... I think I&#39;ve gained a newfound respect for you, Tamamo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s never been this into cooking before...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Me too. I wonder what happened?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I was actually going to go for a “well-to-do fox at the beach” vibe at first, since we&#39;re on a tropical island and all...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> However, you&#39;ll just ignore me if I all I do is relax elegantly under a parasol. Nothing would change.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Even if that actually is the case, I thought you&#39;d forget about me if we don&#39;t have some sort of physical contact from time to time...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Well, at least that was the idea.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Besides, come to think of it, I never got the opportunity to explain my current style. That was also one of the reasons.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re Lancer now, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re Tamamo Summer Version, right?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Well, yes. But there&#39;s something more important than that.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Since we&#39;re on a summer vacation, I&#39;m rerouting all my magical energy to my body, strengthening it. I&#39;m a veritable beast of summer.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> This time I wouldn&#39;t be a close-minded and unattractive spellcaster, I thought. No, I&#39;d be an elegant socialite instead...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmm... I don&#39;t really understand how those things connect... but I understand why you&#39;ve been fighting at close quarters now...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> So anyway, since I am a summer beast, I thought I should let that wild side out from time to time.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> And as an added bonus, I decided to offer Master a picnic and some recreation like this. That&#39;s why I guided you here, you know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Recreation? All of a sudden I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Now that our tummies are full, let&#39;s head over there.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Sorry, but if we get any closer, this foul stench will totally ruin my appetite...</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong> Grrrrr...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A demon boar! ...And this is its poisonous swamp!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Obviously, my nose can pick up smell better than before.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> So I just happened to find this monster earlier than the boar piglets.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Now, Master. This is the end of our picnic.

Definitely not desperate... Yes, I can see it now! By the end of summer, you who failed to notice me...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...will realize for the first time that you&#39;ve actually been in love with me all along! Tee hee!

If there&#39;s no treachery, I can&#39;t go on...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mordred...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ah, no, it&#39;s just like you said. It&#39;s just lots of fun! It&#39;s the same as riding a wild horse.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> For a knight, whether it be horse, wave, or woman... The harder they are to handle, the greater the valor in taming them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m not so sure about the last one...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Is it about time to switch? Next is...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wait! Don&#39;t go in the river! I&#39;m coming out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This smell... Something is happening upstream. The water is getting muddy, there&#39;s dead fish floating around...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Let&#39;s move upstream. I&#39;m getting a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s those guys, probably. Those boars must be playing in the mud...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right. And the resulting poisonous swamp appears to have contaminated the river, on account of its proximity...</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong> Grrrr...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> In other words... Thanks to you guys, my splendid river surfing spot has been ruined. I&#39;ll kill you!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Poison swamp? Bring it on! It&#39;s only deadly if I fall in. Did you think I&#39;d be frightened by a wave that size!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Aww, damn. Not in the mood anymore. Let&#39;s go home, Master. We&#39;ll leave the rest to Scáthach and the others.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, uh, Mordred...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you for today. I had a good time.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...I-I didn&#39;t come here to show you guys a good time, you know.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I didn&#39;t like being watched, so I just educated you, that&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And now that I have, you&#39;d better remember what you learned for next time. If you don&#39;t... I&#39;ll kick your ass!</p><h2 id="brilliant-summer-a-date-with-kiyohime" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brilliant-summer-a-date-with-kiyohime" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Brilliant Summer - A Date With Kiyohime -</h2><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Now we finally have the chance to take a walk together alone. Let&#39;s have a good, long talk, okay?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> We&#39;ll talk about our plans for the future, and the place where we&#39;ll create our first memories, and...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s right! Why are you a Lancer?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...I see. Our future together is very important, so you&#39;d rather we talk about that later? You sure know how to leave a girl hanging, Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m overjoyed to know that you&#39;re interested in me for who I am.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> During my era, the naginata was a new weapon. But, fortunately, my home was well-off, so I learned to use it for self-protection.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Also, I&#39;m not dressed in my usual garments.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I thought that if I carried something different than normal, I could get your heart to race, Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> A swimsuit is graceful, and nothing says “graceful” more than a naginata. So, Master, your heart IS racing, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yep. (Because of the reach she has with that thing.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes. (Because of how deadly that thing seems.)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You know...what I hate, don&#39;t you? So are you telling the truth?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course. (Having her behind me makes my heart race.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes. (Catching her in my periphery makes my heart race.)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Hehehe. Being here with you, wearing a different outfit... It makes me so happy.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Makes my heart...beat fast...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh, look, a river. The current in the middle is fast, but here it&#39;s calm and beautiful.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Since we have swimsuits on, why don&#39;t we both go for a dip, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you good at swimming?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I never used to be. But, since our fateful meeting, I&#39;ve been—Huh?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Master. Do you see that on the other side of the river?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A demon boar!</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong> Grrrr... Growf...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> It doesn&#39;t appear to have noticed us yet.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> It looks... like it&#39;s on its way back to its den.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> We&#39;ve had to clean up several poisonous swamps already. Could this be another one?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> For the sake of the island&#39;s wildlife, we can&#39;t ignore it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> For the sake of the boar piglets, we can&#39;t ignore it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You are so considerate, Master... You are exactly right.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> But what should we do? It might disappear somewhere if we don&#39;t keep our eyes on it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> If we lose sight of it, we have no guarantee that the boar piglets will find it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> At any rate, let&#39;s follow it,</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> But...that means we have to cross this river.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> If we jump over, the boar will notice us. We must swim across it stealthily.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> The current becomes much faster in the middle. You&#39;re in danger of being washed away, Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you give me a hand?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;d like you to assist me.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh... Ooh! Of course! Of course!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> When we looked at each other just now, I understood. That confirmed it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You have faith in me!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Our hearts are bound together. There is nothing to fear with trust and love like ours.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Now... Hold my hand, Master, and don&#39;t ever let go.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I mean, naturally, I have no intention of letting go of you either...for all eternity... Hehehe. Just kidding.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> All right, let us begin...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The current is so swift! But...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re so strong...!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Are you all right? How was my swimming?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The way your body writhed...was like a snake.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The way your body writhed...was like a mermaid.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh my. Me, as beautiful as a mermaid? You&#39;re too generous...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> As I was saying earlier, I never used to be able to swim.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> But when I was fervently chasing after Anchin, I suddenly found myself slithering across the Hidaka River...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Somehow I was able to swim!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> N-Never mind that! Watch out for the demon boar!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s right. Let&#39;s go after it before we lose it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> We found it. Just as we suspected, it&#39;s relaxing in a poisonous swamp.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...We did it, Master. That demon boar doesn&#39;t look like it will be moving for a while.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Let&#39;s remember this location and hurry back to camp. If we grab everyone quickly, I think we can make it back in time.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Then... you&#39;ll have front-row seats to observe me as I gracefully put my naginata to use.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> The demonic boar has been defeated. Let the others handle any leftover business. All right, Master. Shall we have a swim together?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I... I think I&#39;m too tired for a swim right now...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh, really? But there&#39;s no need to worry, Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You see... In the end, while thinking of Anchin, I went to the bottom of the river.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> It was cold... and quiet... The water seemed to engulf my burning feelings for him.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> It was me, and Anchin within my heart... Just the two of us... at the bottom of the river.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...But what if it had been the real Anchin there with me? I have often wished it were so.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Therefore, Master, being alone with you at the bottom of the river might not be so bad either.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> If you ever tire of your life... feel free to let me know, all right?</p><h2 id="brilliant-summer-an-expedition-with-anne-and-mary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brilliant-summer-an-expedition-with-anne-and-mary" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Brilliant Summer - An Expedition With Anne and Mary -</h2><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouu!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This...is a big one!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Wow!

That&#39;s just unfair...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, I see... You&#39;re great pirates who have spent most of your lives at sea, so you&#39;re not used to the ground shaking like this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh! Another one! A big aftershock!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> All hands! Grab onto something!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> ... (Aha! That&#39;s it!)</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Eek!

Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Mary? What are you doing, throwing yourself on the ground and grabbing Fou&#39;s legs like that?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...What, me? I was only trying to keep him from running away in a panic...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You may be fine, Mary, but Anne is so afraid of earthquakes, I&#39;m beginning to wonder if she&#39;s going to be all right—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At any rate, that tremor just now was quite large. Let&#39;s go see if there&#39;s been any damage or anything.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> What? The earth split open in that last earthquake?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, right here. There&#39;s a large diagonal crack. And—</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> It continues way down deep into the earth.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> It looks like it connects to a cavity–a cave of some sort.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A new cave? How exciting...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s start exploring!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Yes. A cave means treasure.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> I don&#39;t plan on letting this chance escape us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, are you going in right this instant? Don&#39;t you think we should prepare a little—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;ve already gone inside!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Leave it to pirates to make quick decisions... Oh well. We may as well join them, Master.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Yes, I have a good feeling about this. The longer the cave, the better. The chances of finding treasure are increasing.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouuu?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s basically only one way to go, so there&#39;s no worry of getting lost. The problem is—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh! It appears there are still some light earthquakes. I don&#39;t think the cave will collapse, but—</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Eek! I&#39;m scared! (Squeeeeeze!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mnngff...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you serious?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Now that she&#39;s had a taste of it... Anne has found a legitimate way to hug Master&#39;s head...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> You&#39;re unusually aggressive, Anne...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I think I&#39;ll get up close too. But unlike Anne, I&#39;ll try to latch on when Master begins to stagger...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve gone pretty deep.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> The frequency of the earthquakes has really increased.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Yes, yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (It&#39;s like it&#39;s too much trouble for them to let go...

There&#39;s a wide open area ahead!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Have we finally reached the finish line? Tee hee hee! I wonder what the treasure is—</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Welcome! (Rage)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Blackbeard!? I thought you were eliminated!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> That&#39;s not the real thing.

I had nothing to do with those tremors! ...At least not directly! Indirectly, well... Maybe yes!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I am so incredibly bitter... Or, should I say, envious...!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> All I wanted to do on this deserted island... was have some huggy-huggy, kissy-kissy, squeezy-squeezy...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I knew it was...something like that...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Well, he was like that in his final moments too Those are the only regrets this guy has...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s all! Especially since you entered this cave! I saw you, you know! I saw you!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> What&#39;s with this classic “lucky pervert” stuff? Just a little swaying back and forth, and you&#39;re all squishy-squishy?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Oh, uh, I meant the earth was swaying, not your...! No, don&#39;t get me wrong! And besides, only one of you would sway anyway, right?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Kill. Him. Now.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> But she doesn&#39;t understand that I love her for that! How sad I am. How truly sad I am...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> So I have no choice but to kill you! I know you&#39;ll forgive a grudge.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I will huggy-huggy, kissy-kissy, squeezy-squeezy here with you for all eternity!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...And now that I think about it, that one-touch-only agreement we had is still unfulfilled.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Gyuh huh huh huh huh... Mary, be prepared! Wash your armpits and bellybutton and wait for me!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Ah. That&#39;s not right. No, that&#39;s not right, Blackbeard. Dear me, has becoming a ghost made me senile?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I take back my last statement. You don&#39;t need to wash at all.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I can&#39;t stand this guy any longer!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have no choice: for the peace of this island, we must destroy this grudge!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> How...unfortunate...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> But as long as you don&#39;t reform your HHKKSS desert island life, Blackbeard will be back a second and a third time...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I couldn&#39;t stand to see you again!

Why would he smile at the very end? Yech. That is so creepy.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> ...Well, if I loved Master or Mary so much that a jealous grudge kept me lingering on in this world after death...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> ...then a final killing blow from either of you...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> ...might very well make me smile too, you know!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...Quit saying such crazy things.

We can indeed use a fire of some sort...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I would like to help out, but I&#39;m in a complicated situation at the moment.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> It&#39;s a bit difficult to do right away. It is likely related to the fact that I am forced to be a Lancer.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, do you guys hear something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yep. From the back of the cave...something...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, like the sound of rustling leaves. What could it be?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Oh, the sound is getting closer! Please be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Something&#39;s coming from the back of the cave!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Look at that dark, creeping shadow spreading out across the ground...

I&#39;m sure everyone had the same idea.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> By the way, it has stopped raining. At least we&#39;re fortunate in that regard. Perhaps it&#39;s the will of God.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> However, such unstable weather conditions mean that another squall can happen anytime.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Never mind us. Master may have to continue facing drastic temperature changes.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hm. Which means–</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Mikon! I&#39;ve got an idea, Master! No matter what our situation, I think we need to create a home base!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I agree. I think it is necessary to find a place to rest. Luckily, it looks like we can easily obtain wood.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Yup yup, Kiyohime gets it! The smell of wood is really comforting, you know?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I don&#39;t mind how small it is, Master. They say home is where the heart is.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Rather, we may be forced to keep our bodies close...perhaps our shoulders may accidentally touch...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh my. If that is the case, should I be thinking of baby names...?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> How far ahead are you thinking...?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Please wait. I&#39;m afraid to bring this up, but...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> You speak of a simple wooden dwelling... Isn&#39;t that just going to be like a stable?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Hmph! What are you trying to say, huh? That wooden houses are for animals? Yeah, yeah, I&#39;m a fox, she&#39;s a snake... So what!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> No, um, I did not mean to say anything rude. I apologize.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I just wanted to point out that this is going to be Master&#39;s first base.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Considering this is going to be the new frontier for the pioneering of this island, a house made of wood seems to be a little austere.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I believe we should first use stones to build sturdy living quarters.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> The stability of a stone-made base is incomparable. Its defensive powers are also very strong.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Dammit, even if it&#39;s a coincidence, our opinions matched! Yep, defense is important!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey...what about iron? Why don&#39;t we use iron to build it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s strong, and we&#39;ll be safe from any enemy. Good idea, right? (Glance)</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> So in conclusion, Master, I recommend a stone base.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (...Dammit, Father is pretending not to hear me!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Everyone, you all have your opinions.

However, I&#39;m starting to think it&#39;s all a bit inefficient, so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve discussed the matter with Scáthach.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> Mm, she has indeed. For now, we&#39;ve decided to create a watering place somewhere.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> It&#39;ll be a place to preserve fresh water. My runes will help in the process too.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong> What we need Master to decide is its shape.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> A watering place...the obvious shape would be a well. It should be easy to make it with wood.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> A well is fine, but wouldn&#39;t the wood rot? I think it would be more durable if it were built with bricks.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And it would look nice too.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Water is important. I agree with Mash.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Of course. Water is your lifeline out at sea.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Once it runs out, all you can do is pray. Either wait till you die or it rains.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-You sound like you know what you&#39;re talking about...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> So here&#39;s my suggestion. A watering place needs to be practical. It needs to be in the most practical shape. Which means...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> A faucet would be good☆</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I&#39;ve been impressed by it ever since I&#39;ve been at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> If you turn on the faucet, water flows out.

Have you heard of a gentleman by the name of Ono-no-Takamura?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think I&#39;ve heard of him...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...Ah, oh no! What have I done? To have uttered the name of another gentleman in your presence!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Please do not misunderstand. I am neither unfaithful nor frivolous.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I swear upon my own life that I consider his existence less important to me than an ant and I merely referenced his name for the purpose of knowledge, and–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, who is he, exactly?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Ahem. Oh, yes. He was a court noble famous for his poetry and writing.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Legend has it that he descended into the realm of the dead every day and night via a well to help Lord Enma with his duties.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> My own father used to warn me, “Don&#39;t shout into a well. The dead will drag you down!”</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Perhaps wells really are linked to the netherworld.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s scary.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Actually, I find it comforting.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> After all, even if I expire and am forced to return to the Throne of Heroes,</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I can still use this well to come back to you, Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You know what, I&#39;ll definitely come back.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You&#39;ve poured so much love for me into this well.

I was just reminiscing about days gone by and my mind wandered.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> How strange that a well on a desert island would conjure images of the past.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Perhaps because my past had nothing, just like this island.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Then again, it was 2,000 years ago. Of course there was nothing. No civilization, no machinery...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes...it brings back memories. I had nothing, but I was happy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Happy?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes, happy. Since I had nothing to begin with, I appreciated what was granted to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wasn&#39;t it inconvenient?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> There were some inconveniences, but I was happy.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And with nothing, I could realize the importance of the things that were granted to me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> –God&#39;s love and faith.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I am like this now because I lived through that time.

By the way, you mentioned something earlier, but how are corn and pirates connected?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Right. Mash, Master. Where do you think is famous for its corn?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Andes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No clue...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes... I feel like America would surpass other countries in amount of corn produced.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Right. Originally, corn was almost only found in the Americas.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> But, at some point it spread to Europe, where we lived at the time.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> One man brought it back to Europe from the American continent.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Yes. The man&#39;s name was Christopher Columbus.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ve heard of him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He crossed the Atlantic, right?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> It wasn&#39;t just corn, either.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Because of him, all kinds of things started to spread throughout Europe that were not formerly there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I have heard that his actions led to an unprecedented exchange of flora, fauna, and culture</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> between the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. They call this phenomenon the “Columbian Exchange.”</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Oh, I didn&#39;t know there was a term for it.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Well, label it however you like. But if you think about it, it&#39;s pretty amazing, right?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Things that people never knew existed...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> People from opposite parts of the world probably had no idea other things existed in other places.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Yet such unimaginable things began to spread into their culture one after the other until they were regarded as normal. What people took for granted was completely transformed.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> So, here&#39;s my thinking.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Columbus&#39;s long voyage robbed both continents of their so-called “common knowledge.”</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> In that sense, that would make Columbus the great forefather of pirates like us.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> So we&#39;re going to show our respect to our great founder with this cornfield.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Maybe someday we will be lucky enough to plunder some great treasure that will shock the whole world!</p><h2 id="project-7-let-s-build-a-ranch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#project-7-let-s-build-a-ranch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Project 7: Let&#39;s Build a Ranch</h2><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Anything is fine with me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Argh!

Even my village had a waterwheel.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I had no special feelings for it back then, but now that I hear it in a deserted tropical island like this...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I never expected it could be so refined.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Refined...huh?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I don&#39;t care if you think it&#39;s refined or elegant, but I was enjoying a moment of relaxation with Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> The more people disturb us, the less cozy I can get with Master. Hurry up, do your business, and go away.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I have no business. I simply came over attracted to this sound.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Mash and Master. I won&#39;t say it is a bad thing to admire the handiness of waterwheels or their history.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> But it is also good to simply close your eyes and lend your ears to the splashing sound of water and creaking lumber.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foufooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, Fou was itching to do something and finally jumped on top of the waterwheel, using it like an exercise machine!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouuu, fouuu♪</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He looks like he&#39;s enjoying it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This reminds me of something...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Is that elegant, too...?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Of course. I just came up with a haiku: At the bottom right / Continuously running / The creature sprints on.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Ah yes, how elegant. The first line “At the bottom right” seems meaningless, but it actually displays my remarkable poetic sense.

They look very pleased with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> For security purposes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe they have a fetish for lighthouses?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, Senpai.

It&#39;s rolling towards–</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And if someone steps into that room, take this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A ceiling trap!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ... (I managed to prop the ceiling up with my spear–but now I can&#39;t move.)</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Good grief, it&#39;s dangerous to aimlessly walk around here. Shall we sit here a moment and rest–</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And this button opens the trapdoor in the floor.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Whaaaaaaat?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-What an appalling fortress. You seem to have quite a variety of security systems built into the place.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> H-How reassuring...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Right? You know what they say: “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But, you know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe you went a little overboard?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey. Lemme ask you something. Do you know why I&#39;m so hung up on strong defenses?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s because I&#39;ve gotta protect you, at all costs.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mordred...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The island&#39;s pretty developed now, but we can&#39;t let our guard down. This place is huge. There may be enemies here that we don&#39;t know about yet.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And in war, if you lose your leader, you&#39;re more or less done for. You can&#39;t ever recover from that.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s why, see? How do I put this...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Unlike me, you&#39;re kind of a weakling. And if you got killed, it would be over for all of us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...indeed! I agree, Mordred! Keeping Master alive should be our top priority.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I feel the same way as you do. Until we can leave this island, we don&#39;t know what might happen. We mustn&#39;t lower our guard until the very end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s use this impenetrable fortress to establish an unsurpassed level of security!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Heh, heh! Well, either way you don&#39;t have to worry about enemies with invincible me here, but whatever.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! Fou&#39;s fur feels quite damp. A considerable amount of heat is building up here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Does this fortress have an air-conditioning system?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hm? &#39;Course not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> “No enemy shall ever enter! Whoever does will never leave here alive!” That&#39;s my concept, see? Can&#39;t beat &#39;em with AC.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, but what about the living conditions for Senpai and the others?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Okay, to the beach! Let&#39;s go to the beach! If you get hot, just ride the waves! That should solve everything!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why does it feel like the topic got drastically changed?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t sweat the small stuff! All you&#39;ve gotta do is put your faith in me and the waves!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s just forget everything and go to the beach!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Right on! That&#39;s the way you&#39;ve gotta roll, Master!</p><h2 id="project-15-plan-a-let-s-make-a-statue-of-mordred" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#project-15-plan-a-let-s-make-a-statue-of-mordred" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Project 15 Plan A: Let&#39;s Make a Statue of Mordred</h2><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I really don&#39;t say stuff like this often, so be grateful. Just this once, I&#39;m gonna go outta my way to say this.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You really did it, Master. I take my hat off to you.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> This is proof that you&#39;ve completed development of this island. The final monument...a statue of me!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Man! This is so freaking cool! It&#39;s really got a regal look to it, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yep, yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It leaves you speechless, huh? That&#39;s okay, I can tell how you feel just from your eyes, Master.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> A lot&#39;s happened since we reached this island, but I feel a sense of accomplishment when I look up at this thing.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right, Master. Both me and this big version of me are watching you.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So let&#39;s use this momentum to finish building our escape ship!</p><h2 id="project-15-plan-b-let-s-make-a-statue-of-tamamo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#project-15-plan-b-let-s-make-a-statue-of-tamamo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Project 15 Plan B: Let&#39;s Make a Statue of Tamamo</h2><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I will not say much, Master.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Because no words... Not even by using my ears and tail could I completely express my feelings.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> But, even so, allow me to say one thing. Just one obvious thing.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Thank you very much, Master. Tamamo is truly fortunate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m glad it made you happy.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Yes, of course! My tail and ears and have been quivering in delight this entire time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It looks like it gives good luck.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Ohh, this could compete with even the likes of the Fushimi Inari Shrine or the Ise Shrine.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> This statue is a direct reflection of your feelings for me, Master!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> That being the case, I feel I should bless you directly in return! I have always done so, but now even more so!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I have nothing to hold back! All of my energies and my attention are laser-focused!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Feel the loving blessing from this Tamamo Statue, Master! And with that, let us finish the construction of our escape ship!</p><h2 id="project-15-plan-c-let-s-make-a-statue-of-marie" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#project-15-plan-c-let-s-make-a-statue-of-marie" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Project 15 Plan C: Let&#39;s Make a Statue of Marie</h2><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Ohhh, this is quite moving. There are no large statues of me like this even in France.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Well, it&#39;s only natural. After all, I was only a queen. I was not a hero or anything of the sort.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> And yet, here on this island, you have chosen to build this statue of me. A statue of me, who was a nobody!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> A statue that reminds me that I was only a girl, only a queen, and yet affirms me...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> “You were fine just that way.” That&#39;s what this statue seems to say to me. That&#39;s how I feel.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Which is why I want to thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Though it hasn&#39;t been entirely easy along the way, I am glad that I was able to come to this island with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s been more fun than I expected.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We made a lot of memories here.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Yes, indeed. A lovely summer vacation that arrived unexpectedly.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> But I suppose this summer cannot last forever.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Because if things were always like this, we couldn&#39;t call it a vacation anymore.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Master. Now that this statue has made our mark upon this island, proving that we were here...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Let us put our best efforts into building a wonderful escape ship!</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Events/2018/summer1part1.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
