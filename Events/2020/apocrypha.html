tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prelude" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Prelude</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Seven against seven. Finally, at long last, they are all gathered.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No Ruler has been summoned here. This Great Holy Grail War will have no effect on the world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The “other” Ruler is not here either. He is already dead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He will never be sent here as a new Ruler now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In which case, this tiny, insignificant world that miraculously managed to remain...is mine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Yes, this is my world now. It belongs to no one else.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So I will repeat the cycle as many times as it takes. I will recreate the miracle, and this time I will ascend to glory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In the end, that is all I can do, all I can become. And so, I have no choice but to proceed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Oh. I&#39;m dreaming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh, we&#39;re doing this again, huh?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Answer me... Answer me... Hear my call...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Hear my call, and answer me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who is this...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Hear me, O feeble mortal... Thou art the one who clears the path for destiny... Hear my call, and answer me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I guess I&#39;m falling now? Or maybe just lost?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Either way, it definitely feels like I&#39;m falling from a huge height. I flail my arms and legs around...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...and end up sinking into a sea of darkness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Awaken, Master of Chaldea... The great Master who answered my call...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Great?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Er, yeah. You–I mean, you DID restore humanity, didn&#39;t you? That certainly seems great to me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Call?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Yup, that&#39;s wh–Er, rather... Forsooth, great Master who hath answered my call...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ... ...Master of Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Has thou regained thy sense? Canst thou see how many fingers I do hold before thee?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Welp, that settles it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh, yeah, so I AM dreaming!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Yea, thou art correct. This is but a dream. However, it is also quite real.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I summoned thee hither with this Holy Grail, while thou yet slumbered...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> It is a complicated matter to explain, but perhaps it would be best if thou thought of thyself as a sort of mental projection of thine own form.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Thy flesh and blood body...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...should yet slumber aboard the Shadow Border, continuing thy journey.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...This world is in great peril, and to survive, it will need your–er, thy help. It will need THY help. Forsooth.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you mean this is a job for Chaldea, huh?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Thou dost seem perhaps TOO accustomed to this sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Of course, that must be exactly why it was thee, among all, who was summoned here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, who are you again?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...My name is Fafnir. I am the evil dragon who once made off with the miracle of humankind.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> So, what sayest thou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, what if I say no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m guessing I can&#39;t leave until I solve this?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Nay, shouldst thou choo–ugh... Nope. You can refuse if you want. If you do, that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Yeah... I should&#39;ve known.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> It was incredibly arrogant of me to call you here out of nowhere and ask you to fight.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;ll figure something else out. I&#39;m terribly sorry to have bothered you like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s so considerate... Tell me what&#39;s going on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I want to know everything that&#39;s happening here.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...I see. Very well then, I shall start at the beginning.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...This is more complicated than I thought... Hold on, let me just get everything straight...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not going anywhere.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Uh, first off, let me explain where you are right now.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> This is the Reverse Side of the World. Hmm, or maybe a hidden place on “the other side,” so to speak, is more accurate?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Basically, you can think of it as a mythical land and the home of magical beasts.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Your world, the human world, is built on human laws.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...This world, however, is entirely removed from those laws.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> This may be difficult to understand, but your world came to exist once humanity had covered the entire planet, like a cloth.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> But before that could happen, beings called Phantasmals fled here.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Of course, I hear that Phantasmals have been showing up in your world again as well, now that humanity is in such disorder.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry to interrupt, but...you mean like wyverns?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Phantasmals? Like what?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Wyverns, bicorns, chimeras... Creatures like that.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> They&#39;re supposed to live here, in this world, though. They shouldn&#39;t be visiting yours as though it were some sort of café.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Now, this land is in grave danger, thanks to the Greater Grail I brought here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Greater Grail...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> As in, the one that was in Fuyuki...?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> You really DO know your stuff.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I don&#39;t know what happened in your world, but in mine, I had no choice but to bring the Greater Grail here to the Reverse Side.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Otherwise it would have caused all kinds of problems, you see.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> There was a problem, though. A certain Noble Phantasm partially destroyed the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Even so, things were fine until now...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...but then, even though I didn&#39;t do anything, it just kind of...broke. On its own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Suuure it did.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> No, really, I didn&#39;t do anything. I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I may have a few gaps in my memory, but I&#39;m fairly certain nothing happened during those gaps.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You expect me to believe that!?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...I mean...I don&#39;t think I did, anyway. I&#39;ll admit my memory is a little hazy, but even so...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> A-at any rate, the real problem...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...is that a Holy Grail War is taking place inside the damaged Greater Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you say...a Holy Grail War...?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Yup.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> A miniature war between Servants is being waged inside the very Greater Grail they want to control.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I haven&#39;t actually seen any of the battles myself, but I know how many there have been. Just looking at the numbers here, it&#39;s been over ten thousand now.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> At first there were only two Servants. By the 567th Holy Grail War, there were four, and by the 2313th, there were seven.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...That was when my control of the Greater Grail started to waver.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> That is to say, someone is trying to take over the Greater Grail and use it for themselves.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> If something isn&#39;t done, the Greater Grail will continue to spin out of control until it&#39;s completely destroyed.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> And that would be...a problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Problem?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Yes, a big problem. You see, this Greater Grail isn&#39;t mine. I&#39;m just holding on to it.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I don&#39;t have any right to use it myself, and I can&#39;t let anyone else use it either.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I have to take good care of it.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> If the Greater Grail went out of control, that would cause a great deal of trouble for all the Demonic Beasts who live here...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> It&#39;s even possible that an event like that, or its aftermath, could damage one of the anchors that holds the world together.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> If the cloth–or texture, if you like–is torn, the laws of physics will be turned on their heads, and the Age of Gods will end up mixing with modern times.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> And that...wouldn&#39;t end well for anybody. Humans and Demonic Beasts would only end up hurting each other.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> So I&#39;m asking you now: Will you help me save this world?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Okay, I&#39;ll give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Really...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If there&#39;s something I can do to help...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Thank you!!!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]][[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]][[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ? ???</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Are you okay? Is something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Gesture at your ears)</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...I&#39;m so sorry.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> It&#39;s been so long since I actually spoke that I&#39;ve forgotten how to do it at an appropriate volume.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Write on the ground)</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Oh, I see. I&#39;m sorry. I guess I got a little carried away...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Ahem. Very well then, Let me try that again: I want you to ride on my back.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> We&#39;ll need to dive into the domain within the Greater Grail itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So...I&#39;m gonna get to be a dragon rider!?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Yes. You may be the first to do so since humanity began using the Gregorian calendar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh man, I&#39;m gonna get to be a dragoon!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Ah, that is a popular misconception. A “dragoon,” I am afraid, is not one who rides a dragon.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Though I do admit, it has a very nice ring to it.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Anyway, just climb up and grab one of my scales. Now, hold on... This will be my first flight in over ten years!</p><h2 id="section-1-dive-inner-world" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-dive-inner-world" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Dive, Inner World</h2><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> As I thought, Trifas has been recreated...along with the Assassin of Red&#39;s Hanging Gardens.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I&#39;m surprised this world has been crafted with such detail, though... Who could have done this, and what could they be after?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, what&#39;s Trifas?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> A small city in Romania where a Great Holy Grail War took place. ...Hmm. I see there are a number of Dragon Tooth Warriors and golems roaming about.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> But those should be no trouble. I&#39;ll just go ahead and burn them all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That was amazing!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Why thank you.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I shouldn&#39;t be too proud; this isn&#39;t something I trained hard to be able do or anything like that. Still, it&#39;s nice being complimented.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeowch, that&#39;s hot!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Ah, sorry. I guess I got a little carried away...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> All right, let&#39;s just land here and then we&#39;ll–</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Uh oh...! There are Servants here...and they&#39;re wasting no time attacking us!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Khh...!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> This light... That&#39;s Vasavi Shakti!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Karna&#39;s Noble Phantasm!?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Ghh... Sorry! I&#39;m going down...!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Are you all right...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> More or less...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> My wings are pretty messed up. I won&#39;t be able to fly for a while.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I&#39;m afraid I misjudged the situation... I&#39;m so sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, those were Servants we just ran into?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Not exactly. At least, not in the true sense of the word.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> If we define Servants as pseudo-reproductions of people who have become Heroic Spirits, then the beings that attacked us don&#39;t quite qualify.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> If anything, they&#39;re more like... Well, zombies, or maybe mecha.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> They&#39;re about as strong as Servants, but they have no emotions, and can&#39;t think for themselves.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Still, as tiny as this world is, I never thought they&#39;d be able to reproduce their Noble Phantasms...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;re coming!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I&#39;ll stall them while you make your escape!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ve gotta get out of here!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> That could be difficult. I&#39;m not exactly nimble in this form...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Get to that fortress! You should be safe there. Then–</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Damn, looks like we&#39;re out of time! Why you...!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> They&#39;re still coming...! Now what are they–</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> They even managed to recreate Balmung...!? Khh...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fafnir!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Hurry, get out of here! If they get you too, it&#39;s all over!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Oh? It seems we have a special guest.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> What a surprise to see a real flesh-and-blood Master here.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Custodian, let me take [♂ him /♀ her] off your hands. I promise I shall get [♂ him /♀ her] to safety.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Thank you. I&#39;ll catch up with you later!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Okay, Master of Chaldea, get ready to run!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Looks like we&#39;ve got some Dragon Tooth Warriors to deal with. I will dispose of them.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, but first.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Would you tell me your name, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> All right, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, please listen to me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> First, we&#39;re going to head for that fortress.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My name is Chiron. I&#39;ll be happy to take care of any enemies we run into along the way.</p><p><strong>B：Chiron:</strong> But to do that, I&#39;ll need someone to give me commands.</p><p><strong>B：Chiron:</strong> And that someone will be you, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>B：Chiron:</strong> Now, let battle be joined!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That should do it. I&#39;m glad this rescue was successful.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Now, let&#39;s get out of here, shall we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What about Fafnir...?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Yes...he was just attacked with a number of Noble Phantasms...but he seems to be no worse for wear.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> No wonder he&#39;s been the one keeping care of the Holy Grail. He&#39;s certainly quite durable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He still needs our help!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Not to worry. Another Servant will be along soon to help him.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Rider! The rest is up to you!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All right, we&#39;d best be on our way.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It will be morning soon.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m not sure what you know about our current predicament...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...but I can explain that all once we are safe.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Come, let us hurry to the fortress.</p><h2 id="section-2-defense-millennia-fortress" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-defense-millennia-fortress" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Defense: Millennia Fortress</h2><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It won&#39;t be long now. Soon, the dawn will break, and they will leave.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That is, they will disappear.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> After that, we just have to hope that Rider did his job properly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who is this Rider?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;ll tell you his True Name once he returns. First, I need to bring you up to speed on what has been happening here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can you tell me what&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Gladly. Once the morning comes, I will tell you everything I know.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...It&#39;s morning now. Rider should return shortly.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> You must be tired. Why don&#39;t we take a short break?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Would you like something to drink? Perhaps some coffee?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That would be great, thank you.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It may perhaps be a bit sweeter than you prefer...but I promise it will do wonders for your exhaustion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, everything&#39;s fine now that it&#39;s morning?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That&#39;s right. They disappear each morning. ...Well, at six o&#39;clock in the morning, to be exact.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We only realized this around the 734th Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ooh, this is delicious.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m glad you think so.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> So, what did the Custodian tell you when you first arrived here?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I can fill in anything he may have left out.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I see, I see... Very well then, let me explain everything else.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> To begin, this is not like a typical Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It does not involve seven Masters trying to kill one another, nor even seven classes of Servants with which to do so.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...Ah, so you have no experience with that sort of Holy Grail War. Well, trust me when I say that that is usually how these things go.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Now I hope you&#39;re paying attention; this WILL be on the test.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Now, this Great Holy Grail War uses the Greater Grail&#39;s emergency system from Fuyuki to wage war with fourteen Servants rather than the customary seven.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That is to say, it is a battle between two teams of seven Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...However, that war had in fact already concluded, with Fafnir emerging as the apparent victor.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That is how he came into possession of the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> As for us, we are reproductions of the Servants who were summoned during that Great Holy Grail War.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Reproductions...?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> In this world, the only two places that exist are the city of Trifas, and of course the Hanging Gardens.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...I suppose you could call this a sort of simulation.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Aha. That seems to have helped you understand.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Indeed, this is all one enormous simulation field designed to recreate that Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We were originally imitation life-forms, going through the motions of battle without thought or emotion.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> However, as this seemingly endless simulation repeated itself, something unexpected happened.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Namely, we developed intelligence, reason, and even regained our memories as Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That being said, we do not remember anything about the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> You might say that I&#39;m starting over from scratch. At least as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It&#39;s only in this tiny world that we become something close to real Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Do you understand everything we&#39;ve covered so far? If you have any questions, I&#39;ll be happy to answer them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What sort of enemy are we up against?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who is that dragon, anyway?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> They are reproductions, just as we are. Unlike us, though, they have nothing in the way of intellect or reason...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...but what they do have are sheer numbers.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Of the fourteen Servants who were originally summoned to the Great Holy Grail War, we now face twelve.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That many!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Yes, that many.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> As we are all starting from scratch, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know any of their True Names other than the Rider on our side...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...but I believe the evil dragon does.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who is that dragon, anyway?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> His name is Fafnir. He seems to be this Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> There is not a shred of doubt that he was the Great Holy Grail War&#39;s victor.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Though I&#39;m afraid I have no idea how he secured his victory, or what he is doing in a place like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What sort of enemy are we up against?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> As the Custodian, he would like this Greater Grail to stop simulating this war.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> By rights, we should be helping him...but unfortunately, our enemies are just too strong.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> What&#39;s more, we have not a moment to waste.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> The other Servants have learned how to use their Noble Phantasms, despite still lacking consciousness.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And that brings us to the final stage of the tens of thousands of battles to the death we fourteen Servants have fought.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We have no choice but to repeat this battle.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And yet, the more we fight, the worse the situation becomes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How did you and Rider become conscious?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> A good question. We wondered about that ourselves for a time...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It is our belief now that the Custodian altered the simulation&#39;s parameters to make us into proper Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> As the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian, it should be well within his capabilities to recreate us in this world.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...Though it also seems he hesitated to do so until the very last moment.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Had he not, we may have had a few more allies on our side.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How about just not fighting?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m afraid that would be difficult. There is nowhere to seek refuge in this world.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Though you were fortunate enough to survive tonight, there is no telling what tomorrow may hold.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> They did not attack this fortress only because of the new, unexpected elements that you and Fafnir represent in the current situation.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Most likely, that was simply a function of the battle simulation program, rather than any thought or strategy on their part.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> But the next time will be different.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Next time, I expect they will account for Fafnir in their calculations, and mount an assault on this fortress.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then, what can we possibly–</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> We fight till the end. What other choice is there?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> So you&#39;ve returned, Rider.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Sure have, Teacher.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> So, this is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m the Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Hmm... Hmm, hmm, hmm.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> I see, I see. So you&#39;re one of those Master people!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Sorry to bring you here just when things couldn&#39;t get any worse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um, excuse me, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I didn&#39;t catch your name.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Oh, right, sorry &#39;bout that. My True Name&#39;s Achilles.</p><p><strong>C：Achilles:</strong> You know about the Achilles tendon in your heel, right? That was named after me.</p><p><strong>C：Achilles:</strong> I&#39;m the guy who was completely invincible, except for a spot on his heel. Then I freakin&#39; died when that bastard Paris shot me there with an arrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, you mean this tendon?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Yup, that&#39;s the one.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Don&#39;t ever get stabbed there if you can help it. Hurts like hell.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Of course, what he didn&#39;t mention was that, after he was shot, he decided to go out in a blaze of glory, wiping out a whole squadron of enemy soldiers before finally taking his own life.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hell yeah! I was pretty badass back then, if I do say so myself!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> I was like a writer suddenly getting a flash of inspiration the night before a big deadline.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Are you something of a scatterbrain?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> What? No way!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hahaha, I see you&#39;re an excellent judge of character, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Right you are. He&#39;s surprisingly scatterbrained and quite absentminded.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It&#39;s the one thing that hasn&#39;t changed a bit since he was alive.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Aw, come on!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> At any rate... Achilles, what became of Fafnir? The Custodian?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> He&#39;s resting in the courtyard. Go check on him if you&#39;re worried about him, Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s beautiful here...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Indeed... Even if it is just an imitation of the real thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How badly are you hurt?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Quite badly, I&#39;m afraid.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> The last Noble Phantasm I took the brunt of belonged to Siegfried...the Dragon-Slayer.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I&#39;m afraid that, being a dragon, I am more vulnerable to that attack than most.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I never thought these reproductions would ever learn how to use their originals&#39; Noble Phantasms...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> To make matters worse, we have only two Servants allied with us... Though at least they&#39;re two extremely powerful A-rank ones.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you make them into Servants?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Yes, I did.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> The idea was to convert all fourteen reproductions into intelligent Servants and investigate who or what is making them fight...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...but that would have been a horrible decision. Besides, creating intelligent beings on a whim...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Such irresponsibility would have been too cruel.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> However, my hesitation has only ended up making the situation worse.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I never thought they could use their Noble Phantasms despite lacking the capacity for thought...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> So in a spur-of-the-moment decision, the best I could do was turn those two reproductions into Servants.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Even so, I&#39;m afraid that does nothing to lessen my own sins.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I am too wounded to be able to move in this form for the time being.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> But I refuse to sit around doing nothing to help. I&#39;m going to make a terminal so I can join you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A terminal...?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Just a moment.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> ...Mm, hmm. Ahh, ahh, ahh.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> ...There we go. It feels good to be back to this height, and to have this voice back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, you&#39;re the terminal?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> That&#39;s right. This terminal&#39;s name is...Sieg.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I&#39;m afraid it can&#39;t do as much as my dragon body can, but at least this body can move.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, what&#39;s going to happen to the dragon...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He&#39;ll just have to go to sleep for a while.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Well, I&#39;m not able to split my consciousness across multiple bodies...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Still, I can at least use my dragon body&#39;s power. For brief moments, anyway.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry. Ever since I brought you here, I&#39;ve caused you nothing but trouble.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Well, uh, in that case...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nice to meet you...again.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Oh, right! You want to shake hands. I remember now.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I hope I didn&#39;t squeeze too hard. I&#39;m still getting used to this body.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Now then, I&#39;d like to meet with the other Servant before nightfall.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The Archer of Black, Chiron, is the wisest sage among the centaur.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So if anyone can make a plan with the information I have, it&#39;s him.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Maybe even one that could defeat all twelve of the other Servants, including his former allies.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...I&#39;ll be blunt: there is no way we can win.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I guess twelve Servants is just too tall an order...?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Correct. We are simply outmatched.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Even if all three of you team up?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m afraid so.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m afraid that this was a conclusion I reached even taking you into account, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Achilles, do you know anything about the Great Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Not really. All I know is I saw someone who looked a lot like Vlad III during the battle.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Oh, I think I saw Atalante from the Calydonian Boar hunt too. Or at least, someone who matched my old man&#39;s description of her.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> But that&#39;s pretty much it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> What about you, Sir Custodian? Do you know anything about the other Servants?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Of course.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> All fourteen Servants are divided into two teams, Black and Red.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The Black team includes Siegfried, the Saber of Black...Vlad III, the Lancer of Black...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Astolfo, the Rider of Black... Avicebron, the Caster of Black...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Frankenstein, the Berserker of Black... and Jack the Ripper, the Assassin of Black.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The Red team includes Mordred, the Saber of Red... Atalante, the Archer of Red...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Karna, the Lancer of Red... Shakespeare, the Caster of Red...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Spartacus, the Berserker of Red... and Semiramis, the Assassin of Red.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I see, I see. Thank you, Sir Custodian. You have an excellent memory.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Just call me Sieg. I&#39;m not used to being called “Custodian.”</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> As you wish, Sir Sieg.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Anyway, I guess you have a point... We can&#39;t possibly fight all twelve of those Servants at once.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I guess I shouldn&#39;t have bothered trying to stop them from the outside...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Sir Sieg. I am just getting started.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Aw, crap. This is gonna be bad.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Now, let&#39;s begin this class properly, shall we?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Master of Chaldea, would you do the honors?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uhh... All rise!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Bow!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Be seated!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Wait. Why are we just sitting on the floor in the throne room?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m not actually certain myself, but...it seems to me this is more of a classroom right now.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Oh. Okay. Great.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Now then, our lesson for today will be...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> “How to Defeat All Twelve Black and Red Enemy Servants.”</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Wait, wait. I distinctly remember you saying that was impossible all of two minutes ago.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And it is, were we to face all twelve together. So, what should we do then?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Use our Noble Phantasms to take them all out at once? No, that wouldn&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...Take them out one at a time?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Yes, now you&#39;re getting warmer. But it would be a waste of resources to focus on only one at a time.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That would be like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer. Not to mention that the other eleven Servants are unlikely to simply wait patiently for their turn.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So...about three at a time?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Well done, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru. A gold star for you.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Achilles and I will team up to hold back nine of the Servants.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Bwa?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> In the meantime, the two of you will defeat the remaining three. Simple, right?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Are you kidding? That&#39;s absurd.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I assure you, it is not absurd in the slightest.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Whoa, whoa, whoa!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hold on a minute, Teacher.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Having these two take out three Servants at once is absurd enough, but how are the two of us going to hold back the other nine while they do!?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Did you forget they can use their Noble Phantasms now!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Of course not. But based on what I saw last night, they are very obvious about when they are going to do so.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> A Noble Phantasm is, after all, a weakness as much as a trump card.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And right now, our enemies use them for no other reason than simply because they can.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So you&#39;re saying you want us to anticipate when they&#39;re about to use their Noble Phantasms and...just dodge?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Correct. You may be a little green now, Sir Custodi–Sir Sieg, but by nightfall, I will have trained you to see the signs of an imminent Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I see. By nightfall, you say? Then, that means...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> (Oh great. Here comes the crash course... I just know it.)</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Achilles... Achilles... I&#39;m told you wish to become a great hero, and that you want to do so as fast as you possibly can.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> To be a hero, you will need good judgment and proper analytical faculties.</p><p><strong>C：Eight-Year-Old Achilles:</strong> Yes, Teacher!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I promise that once you complete these trials, you will be a full-fledged hero.</p><p><strong>C：Eight-Year-Old Achilles:</strong> Yay! That&#39;s what I want!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Then for the next twenty-four hours, from this moment onward...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...I want you to dodge every single one of my attacks.</p><p><strong>C：Eight-Year-Old Achilles:</strong> Bwa?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> (Next thing I knew, Chiron was shooting hundreds of arrows at me in that narrow cave. I still remember what he said...)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> (“Don&#39;t worry! Once you can alter the trajectories of ten out of every hundred arrows, you&#39;ll be dodging all of them in no time!”)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> (“It should be well within your capabilities thanks to that superhuman speed of yours!”)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> (“Besides, none of them have arrowheads, so they won&#39;t kill you. They will just sting quite a lot!”)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> (“What&#39;s that? You would actually prefer a more slow and steady approach instead? Hmm... I see...”)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> (“I think that would suit me better as well. This is certainly not an ideal way to educate you.”)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> (“However, since we have precious little time, we should spend it polishing this method to the fullest.”)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hey, Custod–I mean, Sieg?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Just...don&#39;t die, okay?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Of course. I&#39;ll make sure I survive (both tonight and tomorrow night).</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Right on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I get the feeling you two aren&#39;t quite on the same page...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Until now, the reproductions have simply come back to life whenever they are defeated.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> In a system like that, there can be neither failure nor victory.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> But now that the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian, Sir Sieg, and [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, the observer, are here...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...there is a very good chance that we can break this stalemate.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, why don&#39;t you get some sleep? You will need to be well rested for tonight&#39;s battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, will do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m exhausted...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So...sleepy...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Again, again, again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Come, let us battle to the death. Let us fight, and grow purer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Go forth and recreate that battle, for it still has yet to be settled.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Recreate, recreate, recreate...and then, I will obtain what I seek.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Still afternoon, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> THAT was a weird dream...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> (Huff, huff, huff...)</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Oh, are you up already, Master? We still have some time before the battle begins.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hmm. You still have a ways to go, Sir Sieg, but I suppose we can take a short break.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Thank...you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> More or less.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Chiron was kind enough to stop before he actually killed me.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> In the meantime, Achilles and I will set about preparing our trap.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What trap?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> A Bounded Field, to make it easier to separate our enemies.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Specifically, to cut off the nine Servants Achilles and I will be holding back from the three that you two will defeat.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...No doubt the enemy Casters will move to dispel the field, but I believe it will take them some time.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m fairly sure the Caster of Black, Avicebron, is ill-equipped to deal with such things.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And Shakespeare&#39;s...well...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Indeed, I cannot imagine that either of them has the skills needed to disable a Bounded Field.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Very well then, we will return shortly. Achilles, come and help me.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Nine Servants... If I handle Karna and Semiramis, and ignore all the other attacks...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Achilles!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Gah!!!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> What is it, Teacher? I was just thinking about how I&#39;m gonna fight them all!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I need your help to create the Bounded Field.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Huh? But I&#39;m no good at that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I know. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> A-ANOTHER lesson? Now!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> But of course. Planning your strategy before a battle is one of the most important steps toward victory. As such, you will continue to do so while you help me prepare the Bounded Field spell.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We will be facing nine at once. A split-second decision will mean the difference between life and death.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Getting accustomed to thinking about several different things at once now will aid your decision-making capabilities later. It is a part of your training.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Okay, okay, I&#39;ll do it already!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> I swear, I can&#39;t let my guard down for a moment around you...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s nothing. I was just thinking how well that teacher and student complement one another.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Chiron was the Archer of Black, and Achilles the Rider of Red.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> They were, in fact, enemies during the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> As I recall, Achilles was born to a god... As such, he isn&#39;t easy to harm without possessing Divinity as well.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And the only Servant on the Black side who did...was Chiron.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Of course, Chiron isn&#39;t one to pull his punches, even when facing one of his former pupils.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I wasn&#39;t able to see it for myself, but I&#39;m told theirs was an incredibly fearsome battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You really know your stuff.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Well, I did survive the Great Holy Grail War myself, though not because I was particularly strong.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I wasn&#39;t even a Master. I just... How do I put this...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I suppose I was very lucky.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I wasn&#39;t very skilled, nor did I have the sort of charisma needed to command a Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Could you tell me more about what happened?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Yes, I suppose I should.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I don&#39;t think it will be especially useful, but now that I&#39;ve summoned you here, the least I can do is answer your questions.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I am an artificially created life-form called a homunculus.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Huh? You thought homunculi were enemies that looked like snowmen?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know anything about that. I can only assume those homunculi were made some other way.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> They do say that we–well, the Yggdmillennia production process was the work of a distinguished family of alchemists.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> As for me, an Yggdmillennia mage created me so that I could provide magical energy.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...It takes a vast amount of magical energy to keep a Servant materialized, to say nothing of using their Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So there were a lot of other homunculi besides me who were all here at this fortress to provide the Servants with magical energy.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Over half of them ended up wrung completely dry of magical energy and died...but I ran away.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...All because I didn&#39;t want to die.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...You say that like it&#39;s a bad thing.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Ah...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I guess...I would be lying if I said I didn&#39;t feel guilty.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Both about abandoning everyone so I could survive...and that I am still alive now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you regret that?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...That&#39;s a difficult question, but...I don&#39;t think so.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> This Greater Grail is precious. Every Servant who fought in the war risked their lives for it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I can&#39;t let it fall into the wrong hands.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...Tonight&#39;s Great Holy Grail War is about to begin. Are you ready, Achilles?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hell yeah I am!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We will hold off nine of the hostile Servants, and you will defeat three of them.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Sir Sieg, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, are you ready?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I am.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All set!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Good. I wish you luck.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. You can always shout for help if things go sideways!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> But hey, I&#39;m sure things&#39;ll work out somehow!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All right...let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...Screen spell, Asteri Amina.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Good, they&#39;ve been separated. Now it&#39;s time to lure them out.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We shall do our utmost to ensure that [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru and Sir Sieg are able to defeat their targets without drawing attention to themselves.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And of course, do take care not to destroy the wall.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Man, that&#39;s a lotta stuff to keep track of. This is already tough, and you&#39;re not exactly making it easier!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hahaha, don&#39;t worry. I have less practical experience in battle than you do.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> If anything, I will be counting on YOU to show ME the ropes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Okay, I see three of them.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The Caster of Red, the Caster of Black, and the Assassin of Black, huh?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> They are not quite as strong as many of the others, but they are still quite formidable.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Make sure to watch out for the Assassin, Jack the Ripper, in particular.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I, uh...I know.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Good. ...Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><h2 id="section-3-are-you-our-mommy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-are-you-our-mommy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Are You Our Mommy?</h2><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> How do you like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...It&#39;s morning!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Sir Sieg! [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hey, you&#39;re alive! Looks like you even kicked some ass!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> The other nine have fallen back as well.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> While we still don&#39;t know what the next night will bring...for now, let us rejoice in our victory.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You said it! Thank you, everyone.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I only hope something changes for the better before tonight...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Ah, don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll all work out. That&#39;s what my gut says, and it hasn&#39;t failed me yet.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I hope you&#39;re right...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Man, Sieg, you&#39;re a bit of a downer, aren&#39;t you? Why all the pessimism?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I can&#39;t help but be anxious. Not with the Greater Grail&#39;s fate resting on my shoulders.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> What&#39;s the big deal? It&#39;s yours to do with as you want, right?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> If worse comes to worst, couldn&#39;t you just smash it and call it a day?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> No, I couldn&#39;t. That...that&#39;s the one thing I can&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> There must be something driving the Servant copies, though I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know what it may be...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> At any rate, why don&#39;t we take the rest of today off?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...After we prepare another screen spell, just in case they&#39;ll fall for the same trick.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...You mean I have to do all that AGAIN!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Sir Sieg, would you be so kind as to accompany [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru back to the fortress?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Of course. Shall we, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Now that I think about it, it seems rude to call you by your name. How should I address you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You can call me whatever you want, really.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I see... Then I&#39;ll try to think of something that suits me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m going to check up on my real body. Go ahead and get some rest.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have to worry about getting hungry while you&#39;re here...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...but if you feel like eating something, I&#39;d be happy to bring you some food from the communal kitchen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m fine, thank you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I see. Then please get some rest.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Sweet dreams. ...That does have a nice ring to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You know, I think I would like to grab a bite.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Understood.

You still seem like it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What the...!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> We&#39;re the Assassin of Black, Jack the Ripper.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Is something wrong? Why are you so surprised? You are the one who summoned us, right, Mommy?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Fujimaru, we&#39;ve got trouble!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You&#39;re...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going on anymore...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...M-me neither.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Who&#39;re you? Are you a Servant? A friend? A foe? Which ooone?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> What do you want me to do with him, Mommy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just calm down, okay?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;m a friend.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m...your friend.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ...Oh really? We don&#39;t really get it, but we&#39;re not gonna fight, huh?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Come with me. It&#39;s not just her. The other two Servants we fought last night have shown up as well.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I see, I see! So that&#39;s what&#39;s going on here!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, now that I know what is happening, permit me to introduce myself!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> My name is William Shakespeare. Though perhaps Caster of Red would better suit me here?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh, hello there! I see, so you&#39;re the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> And you must be the Master of Chaldea he summoned!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...I see, I see. So you have come to save the Custodian&#39;s bacon, as it were.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hahahaha, how wonderful, how fantastic! What an extraordinary life you must lead!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Please allow me to mark this occasion by quoting a line from one of my many famou–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you ever shut up?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> So the only ones who came back to life were those of us you two fought last night?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Now, I have a question for all of you: Do you recall why you were summoned here?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Not at all, no.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Likewise.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> No idea. A Holy Grail War? ...No, that&#39;s not it.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We don&#39;t sense any bloodlust or animosity, even though you&#39;re Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> This is quite a surprise...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I did consider this possibility, but I never thought we would be joined by three more Servants all at once.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> This is certainly a welcome change in our situation.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hell yeah! Now this is more like it!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Sir Shakespeare. Sir Avicebron.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And...um...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Us? We&#39;re Jack the Ripper.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> You&#39;re whom!?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> The hell!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Well now, it seems this is a day of surprises.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...That&#39;s true. When you think about it, this really IS surprising.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Mommyyy, everyone&#39;s looking at us funny...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay guys, no more staring.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s okay, Jack. Come here.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> &#39;kaaay.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I didn&#39;t know she was so attached...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Chiron, perhaps you can explain what&#39;s going on here in a way that all of us can understand?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Very well then, I shall do my best to be concise.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Now...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...I...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ...see.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Sir Sieg. [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It seems that the other Servants will return to our side once you have defeated them.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> This should give us more than even odds against the remaining nine Servants.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Yeah, I&#39;d say things are looking up now.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Teacher? May I say something?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> The difficulty here is that I am afraid Avicebron and I are simply not at all suited for combat.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> No need to worry about that, Sir Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Master Fujimaru and Sir Sieg know very well what you can and cannot do, and are sure to provide expert guidance.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Th-that&#39;s a pretty tall order... But I&#39;ll do what I can.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Are you up for this, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll figure something out...I think.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I see, I see. In that case, dear patrons, we gladly offer our services for you to employ as you see fit!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Thank you for having us.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> What should we do, Mommy and Mr. Custodian?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Okay, well first let&#39;s figure out how we can best incorporate them into our plan for tonight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll start by keeping an eye on Shakespeare.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can&#39;t have a certain genius writer slacking off.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Good point.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Speaking for myself, though, I just want to make sure you don&#39;t do anything that would complicate the situation further.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I&#39;m glad to know you two trust me so implicitly!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> What in the world did you do?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hey! Mr. Custodian!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Y-yes?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Are you avoiding us?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> No, of course I&#39;m–</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> No, I guess I am, aren&#39;t I? I&#39;m sorry if I hurt your feelings.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Did we try to kill each other or something?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Yes. I...I&#39;m afraid I saw what happened in your past.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hmm. Now we understand. What did you think about it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I thought...it was horrible.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yes, we guess it was. But why does it bother you, Mr. Custodian?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Why would other people&#39;s pasts or memories matter to you?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Well, I care...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I wanted to save all of you.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Even though we&#39;re here now because you couldn&#39;t save us?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...That&#39;s true. You&#39;re right about that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Hmm, what&#39;s the expression for this again? I think it&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Feeling down?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Not exactly, but it&#39;s close...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> At a loss for words?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We see. So we lost.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Well, technically speaking, I wasn&#39;t the one who beat you...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...but I WAS there when you fell.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> That&#39;s okay. We were fighting a Holy Grail–a Great Holy Grail War, right?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Everybody tries to kill everybody else in those.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> But, we were on the Black team, right? So why were we fighting you?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Didn&#39;t Mr. Chiron say you were on the Black team too?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...It&#39;s kind of a long story. Do you still want to hear it?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Nuh-uh!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Got it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Why don&#39;t we talk about something else, then? How does that sound?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Sure! As long as it&#39;s not about doctors or London!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> All right then, let&#39;s see... I know, what about food?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I didn&#39;t realize we&#39;d been talking for so long.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s Mommy! Hi, Mommy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;d better get going.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> It&#39;s gonna be night soon? Okay, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s almost time for the next battle.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Right. Let&#39;s give it our all!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yeah!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All right, our plan for tonight is essentially the same as yesterday. We will lure three enemy Servants out and distract the others so they don&#39;t interfere.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> But tonight, I won&#39;t ask Sir Sieg and Master Fujimaru to handle the three Servants all on their own.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Achilles, I want you to go with them while I handle the diversion.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Really? You sure?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Avicebron, I want you to summon as many golems as you can and have them follow my lead.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> As for Shakespeare... Why don&#39;t you cast Enchant on whichever side you think would provide the most entertainment?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s your plan for him!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Most happily! In that case, I shall go with Fujimaru, naturally!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> For [♂ his /♀ her] side looks to be entertaining indeed!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> You see? It worked out nicely.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Chiron&#39;s actually quite cunning...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Of course, do be aware that I absolutely will not be taking part in the fighting myself!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Teacher! Teacher! We wanna fight with Mommy too!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Jack, but I&#39;m afraid that would leave a hole in our defenses.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And that would only make trouble for your mother.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Aww...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Please, Jack?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Oh, all right, Mommy! We&#39;ll go do our best to dismember them all!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m surprised she&#39;s so obedient...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> All right then, Sieg and Master, let&#39;s get this party started!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hm? Ah, it&#39;s no big deal. I can tell you&#39;re a good Master from the way you fought last night.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> So, y&#39;know, it just makes sense for me to take my orders from you!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> But hey, don&#39;t worry about me. You don&#39;t need to change anything you&#39;re doing.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Just keep following your own path, and I&#39;ll clear the way for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> No problem! Trust me, I got it covered!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Would you happen to know the Queen of the Amazons?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Y-yes, I do.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Wait. Don&#39;t tell me she&#39;s on the enemy side? She&#39;s not, right? Huh? She could be summoned to Chaldea at some point?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> N-no. That&#39;s fine. I&#39;m fine. This is fine... Everything...everything is fine. Yes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...This feels so strange.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Hm? What do I mean? Well, during the Great Holy Grail War, I never directly interacted with Achilles.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I never thought I&#39;d end up fighting alongside him. This should make for some good memories.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Memories?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Well, yeah. It&#39;s nice having memories like this, isn&#39;t it? Far as I&#39;m concerned, you can never have too many.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Especially in my case, since I don&#39;t have all that many to begin with.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> All right, let&#39;s get to fighting. There&#39;s no way we can lose with this team, no matter who we&#39;re up against.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...At least, I hope so.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Well that doesn&#39;t sound good. What&#39;s up? You worried about something?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Honestly, I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;s great that all three Servants we defeated came over to our side. That&#39;s certainly the best outcome we could&#39;ve wished for.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But...that&#39;s also why I&#39;m worried.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I can&#39;t see us having that kind of luck twice.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...Yeah, I guess you&#39;ve got a point there. In fact, I&#39;ve been feeling the same thing.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> And I&#39;m sure that means we&#39;re going to be facing some tough opponents! We&#39;re counting on you, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I-I&#39;ll do my best!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All right, tonight&#39;s Great Holy Grail War is about to begin. Good luck to you all!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Very well then, my boon companions! Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war! Keep my glorious words close to your heart, and may fortune smile upon you!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Is that really going to help us...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Oh well, I guess we don&#39;t need it anyway. Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru!</p><h2 id="section-4-confrontation-dual-swords-and-cavalry" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-confrontation-dual-swords-and-cavalry" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Confrontation: Dual Swords and Cavalry</h2><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Got &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...Man. I can&#39;t say exactly what it is, but something about this really bothers me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Agreed. But at least while we were fighting them, it was clear they were enemies.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And since it wasn&#39;t possible to talk with them, fighting was the only choice we had.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Still...don&#39;t you think it&#39;s strange?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Normally, no one can so much as scratch me unless they&#39;ve got divine blood...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...but those guys practically beat me black and blue back there.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Yes, I see what you mean.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;s possible there&#39;s more to Atalante and Spartacus&#39;s legends than we know...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...but there&#39;s absolutely no way Frankenstein could secretly have divine blood.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Her origin is too modern, and the circumstances of her creation rule it out entirely.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Maybe so, but I can still feel the spikes from that mace of hers when she smacked me with the thing!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> That would&#39;ve caved in anyone else&#39;s rib cage.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Are you still alive, Achilles?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Last I checked. How &#39;bout you, Teacher?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I am, yes, as you see. Though I am considerably worse for wear.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> I&#39;m afraid it was all my golems could do just to hold back one of the enemy Servants.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Are you okay, Mommy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What about you, Jack? Are you hurt?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hmm. We think we&#39;re hurt a lot... Yeah, we&#39;re really hurt a lot...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> But we&#39;re okay! We made fog and used it to get away!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re all alive.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We don&#39;t think we are all alive, Mr. Custodian.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean...!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. We need to hurry back to the fortress!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> You see, we actually faced eight Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And somehow those Servants included both Jack and Avicebron.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That was certainly a surprise.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> It was odd, I must admit, to be fighting a stronger version of myself.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Curiously, Shakespeare was nowhere to be seen.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Oh no. You don&#39;t mean...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m afraid I do.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> They may have decided to divide and conquer, just like we have...!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Then, the Caster of Red may have gone to fight Shakespeare...!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I thought I was a goner!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re still alive!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hahaha, welcome back! I&#39;m thrilled to see you&#39;re all safe! Though not as much as I am to BE safe!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I say, is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> You all seem quite disappointed. Don&#39;t tell me you were hoping I was dead!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, no, nothing like that.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hahaha, be at ease, Shakespeare. We are, of course, all relieved to see you are safe.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> But, Mr. Chiron, didn&#39;t you say we would have to redo all the fortress&#39;s defenses if he died?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> I also recall you saying you would need to keep Master safe, now that the enemy has taken us by surprise.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hahahaha, only in the hypothetical sense, I assure you.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, if the truth must out–and we all know it must–I was quite sure I had breathed my last when I came under attack!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Thank goodness I&#39;m so weak!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How do we know you&#39;re the real Shakespeare?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh dear, not this trope! You don&#39;t really think I&#39;ve been switched out for my evil doppelgänger, do you!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hmm, then again, he was me in every sense, a perfect facsimile, so I may not be altogether credible here...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> That is, aside from the fact that he never said a word, and was shrouded in a most ominous aura...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Still, were one to suggest I might become a more complete version of myself by defeating...myself, I could hardly gainsay them.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Uh-oh. I seem to have talked myself into a corner!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> O world, thy slippery turns, indeed!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Dismember, dismember♪</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> (Gulp) The child fairly radiates excitement...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Well, even if that does turn out to be the case, I see no great cause for concern.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> After all, if our assumptions are correct, the Servants we defeated last night should soon come to our side.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s true. Very well then, Shakespeare, please remain close to me until the new Servants arrive.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> One question, Professor: What fate might I meet should I decline to do so?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I hope it does not come to that.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Transient version of him though you may be, it would still pain me to fill the world&#39;s greatest writer with arrows...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Heavens, you&#39;re quite serious, aren&#39;t you? Understood!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All right, now we just have to wait for the resummoning.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Does this mean...things are going well?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m not so sure.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I have the sense that matters are progressing according to the enemy&#39;s plan.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> What about you, Sir Sieg?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Yes, I agree.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I feel like our enemy is going to come at us even harder, enough to negate our newfound advantage.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Not to mention that it seems all their Servants have gained Divinity somehow...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Those other versions of us were really tough. If they&#39;re even stronger next time...we might not be able to beat them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even so, our job hasn&#39;t changed.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru is right.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> No matter what they may come at us with, this is the only viable strategy we have.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We will just have to have faith that our opponent&#39;s strength is not without limit.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Very well then, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru–No, on second thought, perhaps I should address you as...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...our Master.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We will be counting on you once again in the next battle as well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Rider, it was fine with me. Once I had fallen, I wouldn&#39;t have needed to spread my wings and fly any longer...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Hero of Greek mythology, provider of wind, retainer to Artemis, hero of the Argonauts, hunter of the Calydonian Boar, noble beast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Atalante.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;ll take more than cutting off my legs to stop me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Giant of a man who shattered the shackles of oppression, smiling rebel who lay waste to all around him, indomitable monster of the coliseum.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Spartacus.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Come...with...me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Dr. Frankenstein&#39;s greatest legacy, girl revived with lightning, patchwork body, doll with a heart of fury.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Frankenstein.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Establishing all three Servants&#39; Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This is not the end. I won&#39;t let it end. I&#39;ll never let it end.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I brought you something to eat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It seems like there&#39;s more food now than last time?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Oh, yes, I thought we might eat together. Assuming you don&#39;t mind, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this for two people?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Yes, if it&#39;s not too much trouble...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Good. ...I&#39;m glad. All right, shall we?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I hope it tastes okay? I can&#39;t tell myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s delicious.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> When the Greater Grail first came into my possession, I never thought I&#39;d one day use my power as its Custodian for something as simple as cooking.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;ve never actually cooked before, you see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Chiron looks like he knows his way around a kitchen, but he&#39;s got plenty of other things to worry about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean you can&#39;t taste anything?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Not very well, no. Not unless it&#39;s really sweet...and even then, just barely.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So the only way I can cook is to use my power as the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian to grant a wish.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...But I figured a little wish-granting would be okay, especially if it was done to help you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity... Seven Singularities... Rayshifting...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Shadow Border... A world of white nothingness, as far as the eye can see...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity... Seven Singularities... Rayshifting...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity... Seven Singularities... Rayshifting...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...It sounds like you have more than your share of troubles in your world, too.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, though. I promise you&#39;ll be fine.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Whatever happens here, I will use my power as the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian to send you home. You have my word on that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So please, just think of this as an unusually long dream.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> If things take a turn for the worse, all you have to do is wake up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Don&#39;t thank me. I&#39;m the one who dragged you into all this, after all.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But never mind that. I&#39;d love to hear more about your world. I&#39;m especially interested in what you were like before you became a Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You know, come to think of it...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t talk like you do when you&#39;re a dragon.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Oh, that? Well...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Nobody in my world had ever summoned a Master before, so...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I gave it some thought and figured I should try to act...appropriate for that form, I suppose?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> In hindsight, I guess I might&#39;ve sounded kind of silly, though...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I mean, all that faux Old English and such...what was I thinking? It&#39;s embarrassing!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Please...just do me a favor and forget all that?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Ah!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Somebody&#39;s attacking me in the courtyard!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ughhh... Ughhh!!!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uuugh!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like she&#39;s trying to tell you those are her flowers...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think...she wants you to get off the flowers...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I, uh, I see. I&#39;m impressed you understood her.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Nonetheless, that dragon is my real body, and I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t move it right now.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You can, um, just shove it into a corner if you want? I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s the best I can offer. Sorry...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh... Uhh...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hmm. So that means... Yes, it would seem this dragon is an oppress–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No! No oppressors here!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Oppressor... Not an oppressor... Hmm, that&#39;s a difficult question.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> After all, I came to this land to fight, to overthrow my enemies.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> So would it not follow that the dragon IS a symbol of the oppressors here?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uhh...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> ...He&#39;s not an oppressor? Very well, then I shall wait.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> The oppressors are sure to come. When they do, that is when I shall act, and my songs of triumph ring forth.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> In the meantime...I will wait here, in this flower garden.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Good night, sweet rebellion.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There, there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Easy now.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Zzz...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh... Uhh...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So they&#39;ve both fallen asleep, huh... Oh well, they should wake up once night falls.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Anyway, if they&#39;ve both been summoned, then she must have been as well...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Achilles, was it? Do I have something on my face?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Are you the same Atalante my old man told me about?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Ah, I see. So you&#39;re Peleus&#39;s son.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I remember beating him in a wrestling match once.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> That was a good match.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Atalante, I&#39;m sorry to impose, but would you help me build the trap for tonight?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Your skills as a huntress likely make you far better at placing a trap in a forest than I.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Very well.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...I must ask, though: Why was I resummoned?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Actually, was I even properly summoned to begin with?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> If we are inside the Greater Grail now, then what am I supposed to do?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I believe we are meant to fight in order to keep the Greater Grail safe. Even if we were indeed enemies in the original war.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Well, that is no matter. I have had plenty of other former enemies become allies before.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> You and I were both Red, so I guess we were always allies.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> So, the immortal Achilles is my ally now, huh? Usually I would find that encouraging...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...but if all our opponents have Divinity, that does not offer much of an advantage.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Perhaps, but even without his invincibility, he is far more powerful than any of them.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...Indeed, it is quite fortunate that Achilles is not on their side.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Especially since we are the only ones on our side with divine blood at the moment.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I must say, it is an odd feeling to know that a copy of myself fights for our enemy...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Achilles, be sure you do not drag my corpse around the fortress.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> I&#39;m not gonna do that!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> If I was ever going to do something like that, it&#39;d be as a Berserker!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Haha, I was just kidding.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Since I am based on the data from before the Great Holy Grail War began, my Spirit Origin has no recollection of this...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...but I imagine we must have exchanged similar quips before, given that we were both part of the Red camp.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Yeah, we probably did.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> You know, I was hoping I&#39;d get to meet you someday. My old man used to talk about you all the time.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Stop that. It is embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Ah, youth is such a splendid thing...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> I do not believe Servants are either truly old or young. ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> No, there&#39;s just something nagging me about Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Did you find some evidence that he is an imposter?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> No, nothing like that.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> What troubles me is that the enemy version of him decided to come to the fortress.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> If it had been any other Servant...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> ...we might have faced eradication.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hmm. I see.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...In that case, I&#39;ll speak to Master, and see if we can&#39;t stay one step ahead.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> All right. ...Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Good luck! May fortune smile on you all!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> I doubt you&#39;ll need us on the front lines anymore, so I&#39;ll stay here and await your return.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Along with my golems, of course.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Okay Mommy, let&#39;s gooo!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Atalante.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re counting on you!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Right. To the twin gods I offer this...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Phoebus Catastrophe!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Tch, a Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That must be Rider...Astolfo&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> His hippogriff can pass through any kind of attack.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> In that case, we just continue to attack until it rematerializes. Come, Chiron!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Right there with you!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> There you are, oppressors! So you&#39;ve decided to take cover in the night and strike at us from the shadows, have you!?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> That will not protect you from the destruction of my love!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Good mooorniiing, rebellion!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, you&#39;ve certainly got greetings covered...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...All right, let&#39;s split &#39;em up like we always–Huh!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> This...this is my Bounded Field! So they DID learn how to separate us!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Sir Sieg! Master!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...It seems Chiron was right about the enemy appearing within the fortress.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Assassin...I mean, Jack the Ripper.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yes, yes! We&#39;re here, Mr. Custodian. What is it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Can you tell me what the enemies you saw looked like?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Okay. Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> There were two Sabers with heavy armor, and a Lancer who seemed kind of girly...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hmm. Maybe he was actually a Rider?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> If he was short, then he couldn&#39;t have been either of the two Lancers.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Then he must&#39;ve been the Rider of Black.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Oh, we also saw a few things that looked like Shadow Servants.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We were there too, so we think...they&#39;re probably leftovers from last time or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How strong were they?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Not strong at all! They were easy!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We can dismember all of them for you in no time!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> All right, then we take out any enemies that make their way here, and continue to protect the Casters.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Since we expected something like this might happen, we shouldn&#39;t have anything to worry about.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Fujimaru, go ahead and tell us what to do!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugggh!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We&#39;re counting on you, Mommy! Okay, time to go ripping!</p><h2 id="section-5-chiron-the-sage-s-combat-exercise" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-chiron-the-sage-s-combat-exercise" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Chiron the Sage&#39;s Combat Exercise</h2><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Dismembeeer!!! Wheee!!!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We won!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hooray!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The Rider of Black, Astolfo. The Saber of Black, Siegfried. The Saber of Red, Mordred.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I can confirm that they&#39;ve all disappeared.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Truth be told, I have mixed feelings about this... But at least we were able to outwit them and win.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I hate to think of what might have happened if Avicebron hadn&#39;t realized what they were up to...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh!?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;m all right. I think my control over the Greater Grail just wavered a little bit.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;s odd, though, considering how many Servants we&#39;ve defeated... Does this mean my ownership of the Grail wavering has nothing to do with this war?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> What happens when it wavers?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It means someone other than me will take possession of the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> If they want it that badly, why don&#39;t you just let them have it?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> You&#39;re not even a Servant, right? Why kill yourself over this?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> A Servant once tried to use this Greater Grail to make a wish come true.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And I&#39;m the one who stopped that from happening.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So, I guess...I kind of have a responsibility to make sure the Greater Grail is never misused.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ...We don&#39;t really understand, but okay. It sounds like you had a hard life.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I wouldn&#39;t say that. It may not have lasted long, but I enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Anyway, the battle is now over.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Fujimaru, do you know the Rider of Black...er, Astolfo?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yup.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I see. Then you also know how...difficult he can be at times.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He&#39;s a lot of fun, too, though...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nope.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I see... Well, try not to be too shocked by how he behaves.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He&#39;s easily the most unhinged out of all fourteen Servants.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Anyway, it&#39;s encouraging to know that both the Black and Red Sabers will soon be joining us.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Though I have to say, our “family” is growing rather large...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know if we can keep them all in line anymore.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;ve been thinking the same thing. Still, we&#39;ll just have to do our best.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There can be no atonement for this sin. I may be dooming him to a life of violence.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But even so...I choose to offer up my life to him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Immortal body, sword-wielding fortress, Dragon-Slayer, the hero who bears a thousand hopes upon his back.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about me. I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m mistaken. I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m deluded. I&#39;m fine with this.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So don&#39;t worry about me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Knight of the Round Table, traitor, the one who ended the reign of King Arthur, hero of red lightning, usurper of the throne, curse of the King of Knights.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Mordred.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Yeah! Good luck to you too!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The legend of Charlemagne, troublemaker, absent of reason, devoted Samaritan, knight of miracles.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Only three Servants left. It won&#39;t be much longer now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...It will be a bit of a wait, though.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I believe humans will make it here eventually, so I&#39;m willing to wait until they do. Even if it takes a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand years.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Still, if I have any regrets... Well, it would be nice to talk to someone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Homunculus, human, Servant...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As long as we could just talk about anything, really, I wouldn&#39;t care who it was with.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...That wish already came true with astonishing ease. I know so many things.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I know their memories from the Great Holy Grail War. I know all their data. I even know how each of them met their ends.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Of course, there&#39;s no need to say any of that, and I don&#39;t plan on doing so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s just...none of the Servants who gathered here knew about the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;m guessing they don&#39;t have the data from it. They&#39;re the same as they were on the first day of the war.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hiya, people I&#39;ve never met!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...That explains why he reacted that way. It&#39;s still kind of sad, though.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Nice to meet you. You must be Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And you two must be...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Well? What&#39;s goin&#39; on here, Custodian? Just give us the quick version, yeah?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Of course. I was just about to.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I see. So that is why both the Black and Red camps have gathered here.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Very well, I shall lend you my aid.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So this isn&#39;t the Great Holy Grail War? Damn. What a drag.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Go ahead and sit the rest out if you want. Not like one more Saber&#39;s gonna make a difference.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...What was that? You wanna fight or something, punk?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hey, so you DO get it!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Things are getting worse by the day around here. It&#39;s all we can do just to keep our heads above water.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> If you&#39;re not gonna help us fight, then get lost.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Now I get it. &#39;Course, it was pretty obvious just looking at you.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Oh yeah?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You&#39;re pissin&#39; me off. C&#39;mon. Let&#39;s go. You and me. No weapons. Just fists.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Now you&#39;re talking...!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uhhh!!!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey! What was that for, Frankenstein!? That really hurt!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh? ...Don&#39;t fight in the courtyard?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s small, and if we fight, we&#39;ll kill the flowers?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Tch. Fine, whatever.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You heard her. If we&#39;re gonna do this, we gotta take it outside.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...Eh, pass. Moment&#39;s gone. She took all the fun out of it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh yeah?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m glad to see such esteemed heroes getting along so well.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> The hell we are!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Not to worry. You&#39;ll get along fine once you start fighting side by side, whether you like it or not.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And I will not take no for an answer.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Heh... It seems things worked out nicely.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Gimme a break...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Took the words right outta my mouth. Now then.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Custodian, have you started losing ownership of the Greater Grail, or not?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I have, yes. I&#39;m steadily losing control.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why didn&#39;t you say so sooner!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Then there&#39;s no point in fighting these guys off.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I see. Then what do you suggest?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh come the hell on. You&#39;re telling me the “Great Sage” hasn&#39;t figured this out? The only thing still left is the Hanging Gardens.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right. I&#39;d been putting it off because of how dangerous it is...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...but now that we have this many capable fighters on our side, attacking it has become a viable option.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> However, I believe the Hanging Gardens is the Assassin of Red...Semiramis&#39;s Noble Phantasm. Correct, Sir Sieg?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> As long as she&#39;s in that garden, Semiramis is as powerful as a Ruler.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Back when we were fighting her, all she did was just bombard us from her garden.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> But, if we board the garden ourselves, it will be a different matter.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All twelve of us will have to focus on defending ourselves when we&#39;re there.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Our chances of victory are...slim at best.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Why do we not simply attack now, before nightfall?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> I actually tried sending a flying golem in there yesterday, at Chiron&#39;s behest...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> ...but as soon as night fell, it was teleported back to the surface.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> So we believe that our enemy has already taken measures against a daytime attack.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Shoulda figured it wouldn&#39;t be that easy.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Yes, that WILL make this very difficult...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I have only seen it from a distance at night, but its defenses are obviously quite formidable.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Were you able to make it up there, Custodian?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Well... During the Great Holy Grail War, the Black Team&#39;s Master&#39;s used stolen airplanes...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And Rider–Astolfo, that is... Well, he rode his hippogriff up to it, dodging its defenses all the way.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> On top of that, our Ruler used a defensive skill that protected us from more than half of the bombardment Semiramis unleashed from her garden.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Right now, we have Achilles&#39;s chariot and Astolfo&#39;s hippogriff, but–</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> I&#39;m afraid it will be difficult to attack the garden with those alone.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Convenient as it would be were she to simply open the garden&#39;s gates to us, I rather doubt she will be so accommodating. More likely, she will defend her garden quite fiercely.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, Chiron, got any brilliant ideas to get us in there?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Such things are always useful when there is a weakness to exploit, but I am afraid no amount of planning or brilliance can break those defenses.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m afraid we may have no choice but to charge through the front door. Sir Sieg, is your true body recovered enough to be able to move?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;ve had it resting the last few days to focus on healing up.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> If nothing else, it should be able to fly now.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But even so, breaking in will be difficult. If I take another Noble Phantasm, I&#39;ll fall right out of the sky.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Especially if it happens to be Siegfried&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> His Noble Phantasm is especially dangerous to me, given that it slew a dragon.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Even the slightest scratch from it could send me crashing down.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry I caused such trouble for you while I was on the opposing side.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> She says, “Don&#39;t worry &#39;bout it.”</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Unfortunately, we have no choice but for you to fly if we are to assault the garden&#39;s front gates.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;s not that I&#39;m scared... Well, no, I guess I AM scared.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m scared I won&#39;t actually be able to do this–that I won&#39;t be able to get you there safely.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Oh? Apologies. It seems I was not clear. We will, of course, ALL be contributing to this frontal assault.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> You may be the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian, but I would never put this entirely on your shoulders alone.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> In that case, Astolfo and I&#39;ll back you up, since we can both fly too.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Damn skippy we will!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I promise we&#39;ll keep you and Fujimaru safe up there!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Then I&#39;ll stay here and watch the–On second thought, I&#39;d better come along too. I&#39;d be no match for those Dragon Tooth Warriors on my own.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, I&#39;d better prepare a sonnet to sing the praises of you, our great heroes! That will surely make fortune smile upon you!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Now then, I&#39;m off to write! Only a few hours left until deadline! Time to get that ink flowing, William!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Hmm. In my case...I suppose I&#39;ll have some golems fly in front of the dragon, to act as his shield.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> If I make full use of the Millennia Fortress&#39;s walls for material, they should last at least a little while.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I suppose I could pick off any attackers with my bow...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Do you know something, Custodian?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Atalante, you, uh... You have another Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I heard you used it to fly during the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...The Calydonian Boar&#39;s pelt!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I remember now. You are right. There IS more than one way to use the boar&#39;s pelt.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Surprising that I would use it to try to win the war, though... I must have been quite desperate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you still use it?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I will figure something out.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I do not know that I will be able to stay in the air for overly long, but I should be able to defy gravity for at least a short while.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Mommy, Mommy. Can we use our mist?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mist?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean your second Noble Phantasm?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Uh-huh. It can...uh... What&#39;s the word again?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> You know, I can choose who it goes around. Do you know what I mean, Mr. Horse Servant?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> So you can freely select who your mist envelops...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That sounds like it can be directed, then.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yep! That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Aha, now I see. So back then, that&#39;s how she–</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We&#39;re gonna ride on Mr. Custodian&#39;s back along with Mommy!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Yes, good point. Avicebron, Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;d like you two to ride on Fafnir&#39;s back as well.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, Frankenstein... I mean, Berserker?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You and I are gonna team up, so I want you staying put on the ground.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh? Uh...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ah, don&#39;t worry so much! I got a brilliant plan, trust me!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Is there a legend about you flying that I was unaware of?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Nah, nothing like that. Don&#39;t worry, though. I&#39;ll figure something out!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Long as we get up there, it doesn&#39;t matter how, right? I&#39;ll get us there! Just you watch!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We&#39;ll go shooting up there like a rocket!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So...you&#39;re going to explode?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hell no!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean you&#39;re gonna use your Ma</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Shh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That&#39;s a damn secret, okay?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> What about you, Siegfried, Chiron, and Spartacus? What will you guys do?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Good question...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;ll accompany Achilles in his chariot. Assuming that&#39;s all right with you?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Fine by me.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Chariots aren&#39;t made for just one rider anyway.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Wanna ride on my hippogriff with me, Siegfried? I&#39;m sure we can find room for one more!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...It would seem that is my only option.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I&#39;ll make sure to defend against the other me&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Guess that just leaves this guy. Hey, Spartacus.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> I refuse.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Why!?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> You bear the stink of oppressors. Now that I know our destination, I will find my own way!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Nothing is impossible for me. The sky is but one more obstacle to be overcome.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Please calm down.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Spartacus, you may be a Servant, but I don&#39;t believe you have any skills or Noble Phantasms that would let you fly.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Nothing is impossible in this world.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> If birds are capable of flight, then humans must be as well.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> If I must become a bird to reach the garden, then that is what I shall do.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Yes, I shall be a small, elegant bird, soaring gracefully across the sky...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> A-a bird, you say...?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Cock-a-doodle-doooooo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Welp, you won&#39;t be soaring...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Well, you cannot expect to become a bird overnight, Spartacus. If I were a bird, I would be insulted to hear you think it such a trivial thing to do.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Perhaps we could send a rope down for you? With muscles like that, you should have no trouble climbing up to the garden.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> ... ...You are no oppressor...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What the hell does this lunkhead use to figure out what&#39;s an oppressor anyway?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Good. Now we all have a plan to reach the garden.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...Probably.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re fine... Yeah... Toootally fine...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> I will prove to you that my muscles are truly worthy of your absolute trust.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All right, then. You three new Servants will officially join our battle lineup.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Our next step is get you acclimated to working with [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru as a team.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Sounds good to me!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Aw, c&#39;mon. Really? Do I gotta? I already know how to fight just fine.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Indeed. I am certain a warrior of your skill can manage quite capably.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> But working with a team requires more than mere combat skill alone.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Besides, there&#39;s nothing better than the feeling one gets after landing a beautiful team combo.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All the more so when it happens in live combat, rather than in practice.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...All right. I guess I could give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> (She&#39;s like putty in his hands...!)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &#39;kay then, I&#39;ll go first! Looking forward to fighting with ya, Custodian!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Thank you. The pleasure&#39;s all mine.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Avicebron, would you mind creating some training golems?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Very well.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All right, Astolfo, focus on teamwork, and do not run off on your own.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Aye, aye, sir!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I will offer advice, but nothing more. Good luck, you two.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Wooowie! I&#39;m all tuckered out! Bleeeah.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Teamwork is an excellent way to compensate for one&#39;s weaknesses, but it can also greatly enhance your strengths as well.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Try to keep that in mind once the fighting begins in earnest.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &#39;kaaay!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Siegfried, you&#39;re up next.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Most of your opponents&#39; attacks will be focused on you, Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> You may block them, heal from them, evade them, trade places with another... You are, in short, free to handle this however you see fit.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Well then, here we go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Now I see. This is nice.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Something wrong?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Oh, no, everything&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I guess I just got caught up in the moment... Let&#39;s keep going.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Last, but certainly not least: Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah, yeah, fine. This teamwork stuff&#39;s a pain in the ass. I&#39;m just gonna go nuts.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That&#39;s perfectly fine. We will simply follow your lead.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wait, really? You will?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Of course. Rampaging about like a Berserker seems to suit you rather well.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well, hey, how &#39;bout that. Guess I don&#39;t gotta worry about you clowns. I like that!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Okay, Master, what do you say we get this party started!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Are you two ready?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Mordred appears to be well suited to quick, decisive battles, so let&#39;s try to hit the opponent as hard and fast as we possibly can.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Your goal will be to take out the heavy golems before they can become a threat. All right, begin!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Damn, that was close! These golems are way tougher than I thought!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But I&#39;ll finish these jerks off!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Brilliant work.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Aw yeah, piece of cake!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Have you got a handle on how all three teams operate now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Definitely.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Great. Then let&#39;s take a break.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> We still have some time until the sun sets and the Hanging Gardens shows itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I could still use a little more time.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I see... Then let&#39;s discuss our teamwork a little more, shall we?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> We should still have enough time for that.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m afraid we will need to leave this fortress behind. If you have any unfinished business here, now is the time to take care of it.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Frankenstein. Well...you could pick some flowers to take with you, right?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Aw, look at her, all excited...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You two really are good friends.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Who, us? Eh, it&#39;s pretty simple.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We&#39;re a lot alike.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You are...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Forget it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Anyway, what about you and the Saber of Black? You got some kinda problem with Siegfried?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> No, nothing like that. At least, not as he is now.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Aw, really? And here I was thinking he must&#39;ve handed you your ass back during the other war or something.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Sir Custodian, may I have a word with you?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> With me...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Okay. What&#39;s this about?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It seems none of us has any memory of the Great Holy Grail War we once fought here...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That&#39;s right. I think you&#39;ve all been summoned from the records leading up to it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Usually, your memories would be engraved in the Throne of Heroes, but the versions of you here right now are not actually complete.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Alternatively, someone might have sealed them away on purpose. Perhaps whoever is orchestrating all this.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I&#39;m told you still have your memories of the war, Sir Custodian. If that&#39;s true, I have a question for you...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Of course. ...Anything.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Did I stay true to myself?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I... I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t answer that.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I see. That&#39;s all right. I was just curious.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> No need to give it further thought.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Now that I&#39;ve been summoned here, whatever grudges I may have held in the past are of no importance.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I will simply fight to the best of my ability.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Thank you. That will be a huge help.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> That said, I still find it hard to believe that you are this evil dragon, Sir Custodian...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think you bathed in this dragon&#39;s blood once, right?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I did. ...I only hope I need never fight such a battle again.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It is too terrible to recall...but the feeling of it is forever etched into my soul.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m, uh... I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> What is it, Master of Chaldea? You look terribly embarrassed.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> An apology?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Hmm, I don&#39;t know what it is you are sorry for... But I promise you, I&#39;m fine. You needn&#39;t worry about me.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> You are a Master, a crystallization of the future.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> If you deem my aid necessary, I would be glad to lend it to you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I, uh, I see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So Siegfried fought a different Fafnir in Orleans...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Don&#39;t worry, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m sure he meant it when he said he never wanted to fight a battle like that again...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...but I doubt a hero like him would let something like that stop him from stepping up when he&#39;s needed.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll do whatever he has to. All the more so if the fate of humanity is at stake.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> After all, he&#39;s the sort of man who would risk his life just to save a homunculus like me...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He even put me ahead of his own desires, and those of the person he had pledged to fight.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He ended up throwing all that away, because of me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I don&#39;t regret doing what I had to do to survive. But, I guess...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Hmm, it&#39;s hard to explain.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I wanted to survive, and I want Siegfried to continue fighting.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I feel like those two desires contradict each other, but then again, maybe they don&#39;t...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you feel guilty or something?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Yes, I suppose I do.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> After I became the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian, I learned a lot of things I would have been happier not knowing.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Among them were things that happened without me having been aware at the time.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...The last Servant Atalante fought was Achilles.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Frankenstein was forced to use her Noble Phantasm&#39;s full power when she fought with Mordred, even though she knew doing so would be suicide.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And...a great hero like Siegfried gave up his heart, all to save my life.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> They fought long and hard to acquire the Holy Grail. All of their wishes were pure and righteous.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But in the end, I was the one who ended up with the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Ever since then, I&#39;ve been wondering whether I did the right thing or not.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> What would you have done? Would you have been able to accept a wish like that, and allowed the Greater Grail to grant it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Or would you have made the same choice I did?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Or...would you have taken another option? One I didn&#39;t see at the time...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d have had to be there myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s really hard to say.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Right. That makes sense.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That&#39;s weird. It&#39;s not as though my problem has been resolved, but...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...for some reason, I feel a bit better now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe you just needed to talk about it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...That could be it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;s hard to repress the urge to talk. Maybe that&#39;s not so surprising, since I&#39;ve manifested as a terminal.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> We still have some time before we leave for the Hanging Gardens. Would it be okay if we talk a little more?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Thank you. In that case...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;d love to hear about the Servants you know. Without violating their privacy, of course.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I see. So you know a ninja, huh?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Mechanical? But...she&#39;s not a robot, then?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I had no idea they had the technology back then to create a machine capable of becoming a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I guess ninja really are something else.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So Divine Spirits have materialized in your world? I see. I guess that makes sense, given the crisis humanity is facing.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Huh? The goddess of virginity and the moon that Atalante worships is actually a besotted romantic?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And Orion...is a tiny teddy bear? ...Are they even strong?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I would think that being loved by so many people is a good thing.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So why do you look so exhausted?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;s a heavy weight to carry? I wasn&#39;t aware love had mass.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I guess I still have a lot to learn...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Blackbeard. The pirate.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I see. I understand now. That one is beyond understanding.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Thank you for sharing all that. Chaldea...sounds like a lot of fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can&#39;t you come to visit?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m afraid not.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It might be possible, but even if it was, I&#39;m obligated to stay here and take care of the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Once this battle is over, I&#39;m going to stay here. I&#39;m...waiting for someone to show up.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That&#39;s the one decision I can&#39;t change.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see. That&#39;s too bad...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> If it was difficult or painful to do that, I might not be able to handle it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But it&#39;s just a long wait, so it&#39;s no trouble at all.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Still...it&#39;s nice of you to be concerned about me. I appreciate that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I was worried I might have upset you, summoning you out here all of a sudden like this.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...The next battle is going to be for the Hanging Gardens.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Avicebron said he would make a saddle for you, so make sure you hold on tight to that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But even if you fall, I&#39;m sure one of the heroes will save you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It could be Astolfo, Achilles, Atalante, or Avicebron...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...but whoever it is, I&#39;m certain one of them will save you if you need it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Anyway, we&#39;d better get back. We need to get ready to leave too.</p><h2 id="section-6-a-dreamlike-moment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-a-dreamlike-moment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: A Dreamlike Moment</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Guess I won&#39;t be seeing THIS room again...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> No, probably not.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Would you like one last thing to eat before we go?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, that&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Okay. In that case, we might as well clean the place up a bit.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Hm? I think I hear the Servants calling me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Hang on, I&#39;ll be right back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sure, that sounds good.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Okay, just sit tight. I&#39;ll be back with some food soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s keeping him...?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Whooo&#39;s ready for a picnic!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Not a damn picnic!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Aw, crap. He&#39;s stronger than he looks...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wh-what&#39;s this all about?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Rider–Astolfo said he wanted to have a picnic in the courtyard.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That it was worth celebrating so many Servants getting together like this, even if we&#39;re still missing three.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> What I REALLY said was, “What&#39;s the harm? You ARE hungry, right? Come on, let&#39;s do it!”</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And the rest is history.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What...No it isn&#39;t! What are you talking about!?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Right!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey! Don&#39;t you go turning Fran against me!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh, ugh!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Well... Here we all are, out in the courtyard, having sandwiches together...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Having everyone here together is...a bit of a surprise, really.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You said it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, gimme that one. I&#39;m not eating any of that egg salad shit! I want some MEAT!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But you&#39;re eating it already! AND you tried to steal my sandwich without even asking!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh, uh♪</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Sandwiches...trap meat and other food... Does this mean...bread is an oppressor...?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Even if it were, you can&#39;t just eat the sandwich&#39;s insides. Then you&#39;d be oppressing the bread.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Hmm. Strawberry custard...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> This is very sweet. Children would love this.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Mmm, yummy!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> As I thought.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Strawberries taste like blood! Both&#39;re really sweet!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I, um...do not think that is true...? In fact, they are...ah...really quite different.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> You sure?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Hmm. These would make perfect battlefield rations.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> You can eat them in one bite, and they provide excellent, balanced nutrition.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Not that we require nutrition as Servants, but old habits die hard.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Nothing wrong with thinking that way!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> My king never batted an eye at whatever she ate, no matter how bad it tasted.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It was like she didn&#39;t care one damn bit about flavor, just the nutrients! I&#39;ll take your approach over cold efficiency any day!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe she was actually something of a gourmand?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> My father?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That inhuman old fool? Hah! Gimme a break!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If she turns out to be a gourmand, then I&#39;ll eat every one of Gawain&#39;s “dishes” myself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You sure she didn&#39;t actually want to eat good food?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hell no.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It didn&#39;t matter HOW good the food was! She&#39;d always just give that same disinterested, “Mmm...”</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If she actually did give a shit about food, I&#39;ll eat every one of Gawain&#39;s mashed “specials” myself!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> (Ooh, I think I just heard a branch opening up!)</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...Mmm. These came out rather well, if I do say so myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You made these, Teacher?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I did, yes, though Sieg was kind enough to procure the ingredients for me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I could never make something this good on my own.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Dammit, these ARE good. Ugh, is there anything this guy CAN&#39;T do?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hell no there isn&#39;t. My teacher&#39;s not a great sage for nothing!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Can he hold a crucifix for an hour straight?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> You bet. He can do one-finger push-ups without breaking a sweat, too.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Can he shoot an apple off the head of an evil chancellor?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> In his sleep. He could shoot the chancellor too, while he was at it.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Can he shoot vacuum blades just by cracking his knuckles?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Easily. They&#39;ll go through anything like a hot knife through butter.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> How long can he hold his breath while still acting at full strength?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> As long as it takes for his opponent to keel over!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Is he a mommy?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Raising kids is what he does best!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh? (Can he come back to life with lightning?)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> I&#39;m not sure, but I bet he&#39;d find a way!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...You really mustn&#39;t go around making such outlandish claims, Achilles. Though I suppose it bears mentioning that I could indeed manage some of those.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Oh, you can, huh... Well, you certainly look like you could.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I admit that I can do most things better than the average person, but I cannot be the best.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I could not win against Achilles or Atalante in a footrace, nor could I defeat Spartacus in a contest of strength.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Indeed, I doubt I could defeat any of you in the areas of your respective specialties.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Archery may be my specialty, but even there I could never defeat, say, the likes of Arash Kamangir, who split the earth itself.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I am a teacher, not a hero. I am not meant to stand above others.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> In that sense, Achilles is not my only pupil here.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Sir Sieg, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I consider both of you to be my pupils as well.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I only wish we had more time together. There are so many other things I wish I could teach you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hahaha, I&#39;ll have to think about that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I know a girl who&#39;d love to learn from you, too.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Oho. Mash Kyrielight, hm?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I see, I see. It sounds like I already have quite the formidable rival teacher.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> At any rate, if we are ever summoned to Chaldea, it will be as our true selves.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I expect, should that come to pass, that I will have learned all manner of new things, and may even be able to teach you more as well.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Are you freakin&#39; kidding me with this shit?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There&#39;s no point continuing to study and stuff once you&#39;re a Servant, right?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Not the way I see it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> After all, I know someone who kept learning even after they became a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh really? Who?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t tell you. I wasn&#39;t actually there, you see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But I do know that hero never stopped moving forward. That much, I can say for absolute certain.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...All right, it&#39;s going to be night soon.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I hate to say it, but it&#39;s time to bring this picnic to a close.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you for the wonderful meal.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Of course. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I guess it&#39;s three minutes until we storm the gardens. Is everyone ready!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> No issues here.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...This outfit seems a bit...much, no? It feels more like a swimsuit than a suit of armor.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Personally, I much prefer my normal attire...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> I think you look great! I don&#39;t see a problem at all!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I was not asking you. ...Still, I suppose I can make do, since it allows me to fly.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Wahahahaha! I wish someone could take a picture of this!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Indeed. ...How you doing there, Hippogriff? I hope I&#39;m not too heavy for you.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> He says you&#39;re very heavy.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> That figures!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Man, looking at this thing up close, it&#39;s absurdly freaking large!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> We&#39;ll soon be entering the garden&#39;s firing range. Everyone, make sure to evade or block the Tiamtum Ūmu like your life depends on it!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> All right, now seems a good time to make my golem shield. My body is a red shield...Gevurah Armadura!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hippogriff...dimension evade!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> All right, we&#39;d better–</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Oh, I just had a revelation.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Oh? Who was that...?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Xanthos. What do you want?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that horse talking...!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ah yes, that is Xanthos. One of the divine steeds that Poseidon himself gave to Achilles.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I believe it is also the only one of the three that can talk.</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> I was just thinking.</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> How come you and Lord Chiron are the only ones not on the enemy side, Lord Achilles?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...Is that really important right now?</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> It is, yes.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> All right then, let&#39;s hear it.</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> ...I think you two must have been quite expensive.</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> That&#39;s not to say Lady Mordred, Lord Siegfried, and Lord Karna weren&#39;t expensive as well, of course.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> What do you mean by expensive?</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> You know, like in a strategy game.</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> In games like that, it is very expensive to create powerful units.</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> First you have to work your way up the tech tree, and that takes a long time on its own.</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> And all this time, our opponent in this game, this Great Holy Grail War within the Greater Grail...</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> ...has been laying the groundwork to produce the most powerful units possible.</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> No doubt whoever it is put in a lot of hard work. So, if this opponent is in the Hanging Gardens now...</p><p><strong>A：Xanthus:</strong> ...then of course, they&#39;ll be waiting for the right time to use their new units. This just occurred to me.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...Setting aside how you even know what a strategy game is...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...I must admit that is a strong possibility. In which case, our first move will have to be...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Achilles.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Y-yeah? What is it, Teacher?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I want you to neutralize the other side&#39;s Achilles. I&#39;ll do the same with their Chiron.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...Aw, c&#39;mon, Teacher. Xanthos has a history of blowing smoke up your–</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...Okay, yep. That was me, all right...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It would seem he was right on the money.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Everyone? Your attention, if I may?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> My Noble Phantasm has no telegraph or tell of any kind. If the enemy Chiron uses it on you, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll just have to trust in your luck.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> You may as well tell us to roll over and die! (↑ Luck rank: E)</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Yeah. That is hardly encouraging advice.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> My, my. At long last, the battle with all fourteen Servants will begin!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Though we yet lack the Assyrian empress AND the great hero of India!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> To say nothing of the enemy having the Hanging Gardens to serve as their airborne fortress!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Do we really have a hope of winning this?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> You&#39;re the great writer! Figure something out!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> ...Their assault is relentless!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hang on. Where the hell are Mordred and Fran!? Oh, and Spartacus, I guess.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right then.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh? You wanna know my plan to get us up there?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> It&#39;s simple. I&#39;m gonna blast up there with my Mana Burst.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Then there was no point in you staying behind? &#39;Course there was!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> See, even with my Mana Burst, it&#39;s gonna be tough getting all the way up there myself.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> But not with you here.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You got it. Your Noble Phantasm&#39;s all about lightning too, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So if we both power each other up, then boom! We&#39;re in business!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll be fine! If we don&#39;t make it up there, all that&#39;ll happen is we&#39;ll crash right back down to the ground.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, right. Can&#39;t have this armor weighing me down.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> There we go. Now, let&#39;s do this thing!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> One, two...THREE!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Hmm. So much for my shield.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> It&#39;s Karna...!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We&#39;ll make some mist...!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> He keeps blowing it away! This is why we hate really powerful Servants!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> I suppose we have no choice but for me to take the field. Shakespeare, you will be the next sacrifice after the five seconds it takes him to kill me.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Wait!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I don&#39;t mind throwing my life away if there&#39;s no other choice, but we must have SOME alternative we have not yet tried before it comes to that!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Hmm. ...I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Say, for instance if someone capable of saving us were to suddenly fall from the sky like a shooting star.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did anyone else just notice a flash of light from the groun</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Something just shot up, sent Karna flying, and smacked into the Hanging Gardens...didn&#39;t it...?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...I don&#39;t want to think too hard about it, but...I wonder if it might not have been Mordred and Fran...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...(Gasp!)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Aw shit, close one. But also kinda awesome. For a second there, I saw Father&#39;s hand reaching out for me.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> ...That...was...awful...!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, you actually talked!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> So...reckless!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, don&#39;t sweat it! What matters is that we made it here!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Woo! Yeah, time to SMASH! That oughta help all the other slowpokes catch up!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh... UhhhhhhAAAAAAHHH!!!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Whoa, hey! I didn&#39;t mean right this secon–Ah, dammit...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Eh, screw it. Might as well kick this party off with my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Clarent Blood Arthur!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> That was reckless and ridiculous, but it was very helpful! Now&#39;s our chance to head inside the gardens.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I&#39;ll switch back to my terminal after we land.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you sure it&#39;s okay to leave this body unattended?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Without my soul inside it, it&#39;s basically an oversized monster costume.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> It&#39;d be kind of annoying if it were destroyed, but if it comes to that, I&#39;ll just make a new one!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Good, we made it. Now to switch back...!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...There we go. Now come on, let&#39;s hurry.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The Assassin of Red, Semiramis. The Lancer of Red, Karna.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And the Lancer of Black, Vlad III.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Since we have other Servants on our side, we&#39;ll have to defeat them, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...It&#39;s possible these three are the ones seeking the Greater Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even Karna...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> True, that would be very out of character, so it&#39;s probably not Karna.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> If there&#39;s anyone who wants the Greater Grail more than anything...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...it would have to be that other man.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, there they are. &#39;Sup, Custodian?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uhhh...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So you&#39;re all right... How about you, Frankenstein? Are you okay?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Never...again. Ever.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> (Wow! It was so bad it actually got her to speak...!)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, just &#39;cause our opponents can think doesn&#39;t mean they can really THINK, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Best they can do is some normal, orthodox planning, y&#39;know?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So I figured if we hit them with a reckless, batshit insane plan like mine, where one false step would get you killed, they&#39;d HAVE to fall for it!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So you actually thought that far ahead...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call it “thinking”...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well it was, dammit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m thinking this was dumb luck. Like, really dumb luck.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh, uh! (Vigorous nod)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, we&#39;re up against that bitchy empress who owns these gardens, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Not really sure why, but that lady seriously pisses me off!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Besides, even if we&#39;d been on the same team during the war, I bet we&#39;d have been at each other&#39;s throats the entire time anyway!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> (She&#39;s certainly got that right.)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right, Master of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Just point us at whoever&#39;s face we need to smash in!</p><h2 id="section-7-decisive-battle-hanging-gardens" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-decisive-battle-hanging-gardens" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Decisive Battle: Hanging Gardens</h2><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Get...OUTTA HERE!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Fujimaru!

(You do.)</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> I have ascended!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Mr. Muscleman! It&#39;s about time! Hiya.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...I can&#39;t believe you actually climbed all the way here during that fierce battle...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> That rope held up really well!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Indeed. It is a rope with a rebellious spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you okay? Can you still fight?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Rebelling against oppressors is my greatest love AND greatest power!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;ll be morning soon...but the Hanging Gardens are still here, just like we thought they&#39;d be.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m guessing the Assassin of Red joined our side after we won that last battle.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Which means these gardens belong to both our enemy, and our ally.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Right you are. Your plan was rash, but successful.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...There you are. The Assassin of Red, Semiramis.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> I have a fairly good idea of what&#39;s going on here.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> It was your negligence that led to this situation. Wasn&#39;t it, Custodian?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...You may be right.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The last wish remaining in this Greater Grail was one that should never be granted, but it was also nobler than any other wish had ever been.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I never thought about touching it myself. I couldn&#39;t have even if I wanted to.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> That explains it.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> No wonder a mere human, a mere mage, a mere Master, made it so far then.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...Does that mean you know who our enemy is?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Oh yes, I know him all too well. I may not have my memories of the war either, but I do have these gardens.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> As such, it was a trivial matter to learn of him.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Ahh, it seems another has been revived.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...Forgive me. We really made you work back there.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. I will admit, though, that your attack was so powerful, it&#39;s almost a shame we&#39;re on the same side now.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> Thank you. Indeed, I wish we could have had a proper battle.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> All of you, come with me. Now that thirteen of us have been revived, night and day no longer matter.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Our enemy awaits us before the Greater Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Our enemy?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Yes, our enemy. A man, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> The only Master other than you in this entire world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I have lost. Leave me be, and continue onward. I regret that I have no gift for you apart from my defeat.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Armor of gold, godkiller lance, lone kshatriya of the great Mahabharata, warrior, brave, Hero of Benefaction.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Karna.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But...I am tired now. Tired enough even to forgive your deception. ...What&#39;s more, I have lost.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The oldest known poisoner, the empress as dreadful as she is beautiful, the queen of Assyria who desired not love, but power.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Semiramis.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Thirteen Servants in total. And now, I have perfect reproduction data for all of them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Enough to begin the Great Holy Grail War once again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Soon, I will reach the number of battles needed to shut down the wish made upon the Grail...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...and tamper with it myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I reach out my hand, over and over and over.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> I copied thirteen Servants, created shadows, and set the stage as best I could.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> I am the only one left, and now, I shall become the final Servant.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> My control over the system has reached eighty-seven percent. More than enough to grant my wish.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> And yet... And yet, and yet, and yet...!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> I am unable to speak my wish aloud!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> You... You would still resist me...!?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Of course. Under normal circumstances, this system would not even grant the likes of you an audience.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> It matters not how many years it was in your possession. It was another, far greater mage who did the work, not you.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Enough is enough, you cheap imitation of Vlad III.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Imitation?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> That&#39;s right. This man is no Servant.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> And yet, he is also Vlad III.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> How the hell&#39;s that work?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I explained this to Fujimaru once before.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He was the Master who desired the Greater Grail more than anyone, save for myself and a certain priest.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He was the leader of the Black team, and the head of the Yggdmillennia family.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And he was the mage who hid the Greater Grail and studied it himself for sixty years.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He desired the Greater Grail so much that he betrayed the Lancer of Black, Vlad III...his own Servant.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He is Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> ... ...Haha, hahaha, hahaha!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> So, with the exception of the Extra class, every Heroic Spirit from the war is assembled here!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Along with the homunculus who stole the Greater Grail from me! From mankind itself!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Khh... Ahh, the pain. I can feel my psyche slipping away.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> But that doesn&#39;t matter anymore, as the reproduction is perfect.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...So you still desire the Greater Grail, even though your soul is practically falling apart?</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> A tool, a THING like you could never understand.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> No, none of you heroes could ever understand. You&#39;ve always had power to fall back on.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Not me. I worked myself to the bone. I racked my brain studying magecraft so intensely it nearly killed me!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I extended my life even as I lived in fear. I threw myself into a Holy Grail War! I commanded armies! Betrayed my allies!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I&#39;m not like the three families who let their own indolence guide them until they lost sight of the goal!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I&#39;M the one who wanted this Greater Grail more than anyone! I&#39;M the one who desired it most!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Whether or not that is true, Darnic has been dead for a long time now.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The thing speaking now is nothing more than the lingering desires left behind after his death.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The desire...left behind...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...As I said earlier, he betrayed Vlad III, right before he died.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He used a Command Spell to force Vlad III to transform into a vampire and then merged with him.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> the result was a horrid monster, neither human nor vampire.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But even that did not gain him the Greater Grail. A priest who was a Master for the Red team defeated him, you see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That should have been the end of it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> When a Servant dies, they dissolve into purified magical energy, and are absorbed by the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...But that did not happen with him.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Most likely because he was still...human.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s part of it...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...but it&#39;s also because Darnic consumed the souls of infants to extend his life.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Now, he is neither human, nor Servant.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He is just a...thing. One driven solely by the desire to win the Holy Grail for itself.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That is all this “Darnic” is.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Damn... Sounds more like putting down a rabid dog than kicking ass!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The Greater Grail is close to falling apart. You won&#39;t even be able to activate the Third Magic, let alone reach the Root.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Give it up. Your dream ended long ago.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Oh no it didn&#39;t! Not yet!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Have you forgotten what I told you earlier?</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I now control eighty-seven percent of the Greater Grail&#39;s system.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I will make far better use of it than you ever would!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> All you&#39;ve ever done with its power is sit around waiting for someone who will never come!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> What an odd thing to say. How can you make use of the Greater Grail&#39;s power when you&#39;re dead...?</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Dead, alive, it doesn&#39;t matter. I will always seek to control the Greater Grail!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Once I have it, my wish will finally be granted...!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...I see. So now you are little more than a vengeful spirit.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> But this would benefit all of you very much as well.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> As long as I control the Greater Grail, none of you will ever die again.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> You would have a second–no, a third lease on life!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> But, if I am defeated, and this Great Holy Grail War comes to an end...</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> ...all of you will disappear as well.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> ...Now, Custodian, which is the better choice? In fact, let me make it simpler.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Would you rather have a third chance at life, or just vanish with no one to remember you!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I swear to you all now, on my honor as a Yggdmillennia...</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> ...I will ensure that you all leave this Greater Grail, and are incarnated in the real world!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> You will be free to do as you wish. You may make your own dreams come true, or simply wander as you please.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I have no intention of commanding you as my Servants. Whatever you decide will be your business, not mine.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;re you gonna do...!?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I...I have no right to compel them one way or the other. I am the Custodian. Nothing more.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Even if they are just reproductions, they&#39;re still conscious beings with their own unique personalities.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I can&#39;t order them to their deaths.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...Man, Sieg, you&#39;re way beyond being a downer, you know that? You can be completely exhausting sometimes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hey, Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hate to break it to you, but I&#39;m gonna have to pass.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Oh? And why is that?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Easy. &#39;Cause I wouldn&#39;t really be a hero if I went along with you now, would I?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> We&#39;re meant to live life to the fullest. Even if you trip up along the way, that doesn&#39;t invalidate what happened before the fall, or after.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> And reproduction or not, Servant or not, as long as I&#39;m still me...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...I&#39;m not doing anything that a real hero wouldn&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ... ...Tch.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> For once, you carrot-looking weirdo, we&#39;re on the same page!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Carrot-looking weirdo!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I can&#39;t really say I got the cleanest hands around here...but that sure as hell doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll be siding with you!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Even I&#39;d feel pretty gross going along with your plan.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> How &#39;bout you, empress lady? You gonna side with this ass?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Don&#39;t be a fool.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> The most generous offer I make to those who challenge me is a swift death.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Indeed. I cannot consent to your proposal.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I share Achilles&#39;s view. I will not dishonor the life I led before.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> And I am certain Karna agrees with me.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> You can certainly try to prolong your own life if you wish, but I&#39;m afraid I have no interest in that myself.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> I went to my death knowing I had done what I had to. Now, my only obligation is to lend my strength to those with goals to achieve.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Likewise.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> I can only carry out my work when I have been summoned properly. I therefore cannot go along with your plan.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> As for me, I refuse simply because you presume to order me about.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> If you take issue with that, then defeat me and prove you are right.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Oh I am toootally siding with these nice people! Yeppers!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Weeell...maybe I should side with you since I was on the Black team and all...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...but, naaah, can&#39;t do it! The hero in me has gotta stop you!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Perhaps one of my many famous lines will suit here: “Let the end try the man.”</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> So I am most resolutely opposed to your plan as well!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Certainly it can make a good story when a hero turns to evil, but such hackneyed plot twists are beneath me!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh.

You&#39;re going to reproduce the Greater Grail INSIDE the Greater Grail!?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> You&#39;re out of your mind! That&#39;s like trying to create a parallel mirror world with brute force!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> ...And I&#39;m quite all right with that.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> For how can one be a mage without traversing the realms of the absurd?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That wish may be wrong, but as it is your wish, I am sure it seems right to you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But...that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to let you have it.

Isn&#39;t that cheating or something?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It is one of the fundaments of combat!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> In battle, you strike at your opponent&#39;s weaknesses, and make the battle as difficult for them as possible.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...But, with that in mind...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...there is no reason we can&#39;t do the same.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Sir Sieg, Master, please keep the orders coming!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> The Greater Grail is basing its pseudo-combatants on our battle data.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It must be choosing classes and tactics depending on the current situation.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Fair enough. Then let&#39;s do this:</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Have all thirteen of us and Sir Sieg work together.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> If Darnic&#39;s residual thoughts refuse to shut down of their own accord, we will just have to overwhelm them with combat data until they collapse in on themselves!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> Sounds fine to me. Our job is the same either way.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> Master of Chaldea, your orders, please.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmm. These may not be my true gardens, but they are still mine.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> I suppose it would be amusing to completely obliterate them.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> If I may, Empress, have some consideration for us noncombatants! That includes Master, you&#39;ll recall!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> I think you may have gotten on her bad side.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> ...But, no matter. If that is our plan, I&#39;ll go ahead and use the walls to make more golems.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just be sure to leave the floor alone, please!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...? ...???</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh, uh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Okay, she says we just gotta pound his face in!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Did you really just take instructions from a Berserker?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Shut up, you freakin&#39; exhibitionist!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Wha...!</p><p><strong>H：Atalante:</strong> How dare you call me an exhibitionist!?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> (Hmm... She still went back to her old outfit, though.)</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> The lines between good and evil are ill-defined in this. We are not fighting as proper Servants, either.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...But then again, there has never been such a thing as a perfect person.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Instead of lamenting that which we lack, let us fight here and now for that which we already possess!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Now I get it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Get what?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Well, I was so caught up in my own responsibility to fix this predicament...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...that I forgot they have their own responsibilities as heroes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Even if they are just copies, they still have pride. Without that, a Servant is no more than a shadow.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Fujimaru, we need your orders now more than ever.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> This is the final battle, the last chance we&#39;ll likely ever have to fight by each other&#39;s sides.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;ll be sad to go our separate ways, but it&#39;s time to wake from this dream.</p><h2 id="section-9-returning-to-tranquil-slumber" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-returning-to-tranquil-slumber" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: &quot;Returning to Tranquil Slumber&quot;</h2><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> No... Not yet... I can still fight... I haven&#39;t given up yet... This isn&#39;t over...!</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Yes, it is. Dreams end, people die, and heroes rest in peace.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Wha...!</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Kazikli Bey.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> You... You were copied too!? No... It can&#39;t be...!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I sealed you away! I made sure you could never be copied!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> You should have been no more than a puppet based on battle data!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> How could you possibly manifest as a Servant capable of thinking for himself...?</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> It should have been impossible, Lancer!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> After tens of thousands of battles, this was inevitable.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Well done, all of you. Your valiant efforts succeeded in summoning me...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...a Servant capable of defeating Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Laaannnceeerrr...!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> My anger is long gone; my modest ambitions are long since quashed.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Is that not true for you as well? The time has come to accept your fate.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Indeed, you MUST accept it. Otherwise, you will never move forward.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Your thoughts and dreams can go no further.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Darnic, my Master, and my sworn enemy.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> What...? You...you have your memories...!?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Indeed. Of all fourteen Servants, I am the only one who retains memories of the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Perhaps that is thanks to your absorbing me. It is not, however, why I wish to defeat you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> No, my wish to defeat you stems from neither a desire for revenge, nor anger, but my duty as a hero...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...and the mercy I feel for you as your Servant.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Mercy...? Don&#39;t give me that nonsense, Lancer!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> You expect me to believe you no longer bear a grudge!?</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I trampled your pride as a hero into dust! You MUST despise me for that!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Then let me ask you this.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> If I strike you down now, will you die despising me?</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> ...What...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Do you truly not understand, Darnic? You would hold no grudge.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You may be angry, but that anger would not persist eternally.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> We both have dreams we have chosen to pursue, even as we have resigned ourselves to the fact that they will not be realized.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Even though, deep down, we have given up on our dreams, we still fight to pursue them.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It is an act of irreverence. We do not do so out of respect for anyone or anything else.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> We do so because our ambitions...our dreams...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...are the one thing to which we will always be loyal.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Even if others decry you as fork-tongued for your scheming, or fear me as the Impaler for the mountain of bodies I piled up...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...that loyalty is the one thing we cannot change. That is why our dreams stay with us.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...I&#39;m afraid this is likely beyond your understanding, Custodian. But perhaps, in the fullness of time...that will change.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I understand you all too well, Darnic.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I know that your hard work, your betrayals, your plots...are nothing to be ashamed of.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And that is precisely why this scheme of yours must end now.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> For if it does not, you will have betrayed even your own dreams.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And dreams that have been compromised will never shine bright again.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> ... ...Ahh, dammit.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> ...It&#39;s no wonder I summoned you, Lancer... Vlad III...</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> ...If you find my dream beautiful...maybe...that&#39;s enough...</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> Yes... I can finally stop walking... I&#39;m exhausted... This is hard work for an old man...</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong> I suppose, in the end...dreams that have been tainted and broken...simply can&#39;t be mended...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Is it...over?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It is. The Great Holy Grail War has well and truly come to an end.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Custodian.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Y-yes?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I do not know you, but now that you have taken the Greater Grail, you are responsible for it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Though I&#39;m sure you are well aware of that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Yes. I promise I&#39;ll take good care of it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Now, let me give you a word of advice. Not as a hero, but as a human.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Humans will come. It is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And they WILL discover magic, with or without the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But regardless, an excellent ending awaits you. Take solace in that, and sleep well.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Now then, I think I shall take my leave. Farewell.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmph. I never thought he would have the nerve to act like a king in my presence.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> That is why I was magnanimous enough to stay silent during his little speech. ...Besides, the gardens are about to collapse.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Here, I will teleport the lot of you back to the ground.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> I will remain here, and spend what time I have left with my gardens.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Try to stop me, and your already short life will end even more abruptly.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...I heard that, you insolent fool! Now be off with you!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey, I didn&#39;t say shit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I could&#39;ve sworn you said something about “stink.”</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Never mind that. Go on, all of you! Back to the ground with you!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmph. They certainly were a noisy bunch.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Ahh, I can finally relax now.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...The Great Holy Grail War, huh.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> When I was summoned here, did I have a wish of my own? One worth creating these gardens for...?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> And if I did...what was it? Was...it for someone in particular...?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...Heh. I suppose none of that matters now...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> That damn stink bug woman!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s an awful thing to say!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I knew you were saying something like that!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ah, piss off! Just seeing face of hers...she NEEDS to be insulted!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Well, whatever. At least all THAT&#39;S over with!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Welp, see you around, Chaldean! Oh, hey, am I there too?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> If I am, make sure you ride my ass into the ground!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Bye for now!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uh! (Salute)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Salute)</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uhn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Wave goodbye)</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uhn♪</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They really came in AND left like a storm...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That they did.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> The oppressor is dead. The mage&#39;s dream has now gone.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> My work here is done.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Now, I must be off! There are oppressors in other lands that must be defeated!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> ...Farewell!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Well, that certainly...happened.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Much has transpired, but I believe I have done all I could.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Young speedster. You...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> On second thought, you can wait. I will go on ahead.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Huh? You&#39;re leaving already!?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Goodbyes are best kept brief, and reunions celebrated heartily.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> See you around.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Not nearly tragic enough to suit me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Isn&#39;t that a good thing?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Don&#39;t be silly! A great tragedy is just the thing to spice up a happy ending!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Still, that Darnic fellow did bow out rather beautifully, so I suppose that must satisfy me.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Even in death, he was a man so driven to make his dream come true that he went to the trouble of recreating us.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Being as I rather walked the straight and narrow in my lifetime, I cannot but feel the touch of the green-eyed monster myself...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Straight and narrow, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good one, Shakespeare!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> That was no joke!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> “Straight and narrow.” (Stifle laughter)</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Good [♂ sir /♀ madam], I do believe you have offended me...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> ...At any rate, this is goodbye.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Hmm. Master of Chaldea, I don&#39;t know about the Custodian...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> ...but I have a feeling you and I will meet again someday. In fact, perhaps we already have.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> ...Hm. What an odd thing for me to say...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Very well then, everyone! I bid you all farewell!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Since brevity is the soul of wit, and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I shall be brief!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I believe that will suffice to fill my quota for quotations! Farewell!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong> Good grief...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> All right, I&#39;d better be on my way too. I have nothing else to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Because we&#39;re such good friends now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Because saying goodbye would just make you sad?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...Am I that easy to read...?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Ohhh... This means we have to say goodbye, doesn&#39;t it, Mommy?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll miss [♂ him /♀ her].</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> No we won&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We already have a connection with Mommy.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Even if WE aren&#39;t in Chaldea...we&#39;re sure Mommy will keep our connection alive with the other us.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> So it will be fine. Right, Mr. Custodian?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Thank you, Jack. You were a big help.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Oh! You&#39;re welcome! We will let you off the hook for killing us, then!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Just kidding.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We don&#39;t know what happened back then, and we don&#39;t remember it either.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> So we have nothing to forgive or not forgive you for.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Ever since we were born, we just like to play!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Well, bye-bye, Mr. Custodian! Maybe we&#39;ll see you again sometime?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> An endlessly wandering Assassin, all because they don&#39;t remember her, huh...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hey! Hey! Custodian!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Y-yes?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Were you avoiding me?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> No, of course–okay, maybe I was.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I thought so. But not &#39;cause you don&#39;t like me, right?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Why would I dislike you?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> HEY! N-no answering questions with questions!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Now I get it. You were just shy!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Yes, I suppose I was.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;s sort of awkward to meet someone again after you&#39;ve already said goodbye, even if they don&#39;t remember having done so.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But hey! The me you knew was still meee, right?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You helped me out so many times. I was proud to have you as my Servant.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...Thanks.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Well, see you again sometime!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> All right, I suppose I&#39;d better be on my way as well.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Sir Custodian...had you been the evil dragon I faced, perhaps we could have resolved our differences peacefully.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> That way, I would never have had to bathe in the blood of a dragon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But–</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I know.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> If I hadn&#39;t been immortal, I might have died in a ditch somewhere, without anyone ever knowing my name.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> No, I don&#39;t think so...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Even if you never bathed in dragon&#39;s blood, or came into possession of Balmung...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;m certain you would still have been a hero.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Thank you, Custodian.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Thank you for thinking so well of me, and for fighting alongside me.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Welp, guess we&#39;d better hit the road too, Teacher.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Indeed. For a while, I was rather uncertain how this would all turn out...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...but it ended up being much more fun than I anticipated.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> This battle lasted but a few days, and is unlikely to become part of history in any real sense.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> So I hope that, if nothing else, it will remain in your memories, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course. I&#39;ll never forget it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It will. And I&#39;ll remember all of you, too. I promise.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We have a connection now.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Once I have been summoned, I will spend every free moment I have holding classes on–</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hm? You already have a great many teachers?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hmm, interesting. In that case, I would love to pit our different teaching styles against one another!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...So, we really won this, huh?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Back when I was alive, even though my life was one battle after another...or maybe even because of it...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...I couldn&#39;t ever really relax after winning, &#39;cause I knew the next battle was never far off.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> But now...I guess I don&#39;t have to worry about that anymore.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...That&#39;s actually kinda nice, in its own way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It is?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Yeah. I&#39;m...satisfied.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> I don&#39;t have any grudges, and no civilians around means there were no massacres or other atrocities.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Oh, and it&#39;s nice that Hektor&#39;s not here either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you really do hate him?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Nah, not...exactly.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> If you ever end up summoning me, I&#39;ll figure out a way to get along with him.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...Yeah, it&#39;ll work out. Just gotta think positive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I take it you don&#39;t get along?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Hmm... Well, let&#39;s just say we went through a lot together, and most of it was less than friendly.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> That said, I&#39;m a Servant now. I&#39;m sure if I got summoned, I&#39;d forget any problems I had with him.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> ...But that&#39;s not what I&#39;m really trying to say.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> What I really want to say is that I bet I could have a lot of fun fighting alongside you guys again.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> So if you ever find yourself in a tight spot in Greece, just gimme a call.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> I&#39;ll come running, no matter when or where you are. Promise.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong> Thanks for everything. ...This was a really good battle.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Now that the Greater Grail is stable again, this world is about to disappear.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Give me your hand. It&#39;s time we returned to the real world.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Here we are. Now, at last...I can wait here, secure in the knowledge that the Greater Grail will be safe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You know, I really have to ask...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who are you waiting for, anyway?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t tell you that. It&#39;s a secret.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I know I shouldn&#39;t be keeping anything from you, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s fine. I get it.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Are you sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Some things aren&#39;t for anyone else to know. Not even friends.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, could you repeat that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes, but in exchange, I want you to be my friend.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Me... Your friend?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> All this time, I thought that you and I...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...were more like an oppressor and his victim than anything else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What!? No! Not even close!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> So, you would call me your friend?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Thank you. I will always cherish this memory. But, there&#39;s something else I need to say.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> There is nothing I can do for you, nothing I can give you after all you did for me.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> All I could do was stand around...even with all those heroes willing to risk their lives helping.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I can&#39;t tell you how sorry I am about that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s fine. Really.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...That only makes me feel worse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. This was fun.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Fun, huh?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> You&#39;re a very positive person, aren&#39;t you, Fujimaru? I&#39;m afraid I...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Hm? You know, now that I think of it, I had fun too.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Even though I genuinely feared for my life back when we were fighting... Strange.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> ...Anyway, I&#39;m sure you still have a long, difficult road ahead.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> It may not be much–hell, it may not even be welcome–but, I&#39;d like to help you on it, if I can.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> So...since I am the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian, I&#39;m going to repurpose the terminal I made earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, does that mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sieg?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I can still function as a terminal, but since my connection to my true body will be cut off...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;ll only be able to use my dragon power for a fraction of an instant.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...But, if that&#39;s okay with you...I&#39;d still like to do whatever I can to help you out.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;s the least I can do for someone who considers me a friend.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> There. Now I really can rest easy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you&#39;re going to stay here until this person shows up?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Yes. I don&#39;t mind waiting.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Not even if it takes them a hundred, or a thousand, or ten thousand years.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> You see, I know for certain that they will get here eventually.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I have all the faith in the world in them.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Farewell...my friend. And thank you.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> We may not have spent much time together, but I&#39;ll cherish it forever. It will always be a precious memory to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Goodbye, Sieg.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Goodbye, Fujimaru. Take care.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> I hope my terminal will be of at least some use to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Take care of yourself.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> You too, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong> Goodbye, my friend. My new Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;m not worried about all this waiting. If anything, my conviction is now certainty.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...It was a fleeting encounter, and a fleeting farewell.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But it doesn&#39;t bother me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The sorrow of parting may make my heart ache, but even that is drowned out by a great swell of joy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Those few short days I spent with [♂ him /♀ her] gave me boundless hope for mankind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was a short battle. A small fight to the death.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Still, I&#39;m sure that man had no choice but to fight, no matter how much pain it brought him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I can&#39;t say that was beautiful, but I can&#39;t say it was ugly, either.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I can no longer track my terminal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Soon, he will be summoned as a Servant, and aid Fujimaru in [♂ his /♀ her] battles.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> From now on, he will be making his own memories.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In time, Sieg will become a Servant totally separate from me, and forge his own path.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I only hope he is at least some small help to Fujimaru in the struggles ahead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For my part, I think I&#39;ll go back to sleep. ...I wonder when I&#39;ll wake?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Whenever it is, I don&#39;t mind. This tiny, sealed-off world will not change any longer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But if something were somehow to change, I am sure it would be for the better.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For now, I sleep, forever and ever...waiting for the future that I know will one day come.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Events/2020/apocrypha.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
