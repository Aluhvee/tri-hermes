I’m sure you understand.</p><p>Dark Koyan’s My Room voiceline towards Taigong Wang.</p><p>The reason why Dark Koyan is so butthurt at Taigong Wang is because her greatest match, the strongest Beast-hunter (even Koyan acknowledges him as such) had arrived to kill her after mistaking her for the wrong woman.</p><p>Taigong Wang: “Let’s settle the score once and for all, my destined woman (soul mate)!” →</p><p>Taigong Wang: “Oh.

//28 Japanese characters per textbox.

//A tale in Noel&#39;s dream world.

//Noel isekai. Noel wakes up in a world where she got to know some boy with sharp eyes 

in a student uniform, stuff happened, and for whatever reason they became a vampire-hunting duo. 

Basically Tsukihime if she was the heroine. In the simplest terms possible, this is the Noel route.

//Noel accepts the fact she isekai-reincarnated without thinking twice.

//She encourages her partner, the guy in student uniform, 

while they beat big name vampires they weren&#39;t supposed to be able to defeat, 

beat the Toono family head who is (speculated to be) Roa&#39;s incarnation, 

beat the actual Roa when he shows up, and in the end, 

beat the random Red Arc that hadn&#39;t showed up in the story until that point. 

Happy end.

//... Except not really. 

Partway through the story, Noel starts noticing something was missing.

// In the end, Noel notices Ciel&#39;s absence, rejects this world, and returns to the original world where she&#39;s just a side character... that&#39;s the gist of it

*OP

# Black screen

//He&#39;s represent by Shiki&#39;s sprites and talks like Shiki, 

but he&#39;s somewhat cold. Doesn&#39;t wear glasses.

//His name will always be displayed as &quot;Guy in student uniform&quot;.

@ ???:

... up!

Wake up, Ms. Noel!

If you don&#39;t wake up right now, you&#39;ll die!

@ Noel:

... Whawhat?

#Opening CG_NoelWakesUpAtopTheRubble. 

Vlov appears as the bad guy in the back of the screen. 

Shiki is with his knife ready, shielding Noel from Vlov.

-&gt; Quick exposition to get to the Vlov fight already.

* 1st fight - Vlov

An alternative ending to Noel&#39;s Arcade Mode.

The guy in student uniform intervened when Vlov was about to beat her.

But the student can&#39;t fight for multiple reasons. 

(He actually just broke up with Arc before coming here. 

He can&#39;t fight because Arc injured him too much there.)

She defeats Vlov with some help from the understanding young boy 

and rides the hype of being on her heroine route.

* 2nd fight - Nega-Noel

However, Noel&#39;s self-demotivation was too deep-rooted, 

causing her to develop an evil alter-ego who tries to prevent her 

from putting any real effort to anything... Nega-Noel. Why?

Nega-Noel is a decently capable Noel who can use infinite Black Keys. 

Noel cries that she has no chances of winning, 

but the boy supports her saying 

&quot;With projectiles, you just need one well-timed hit. 

Besides isn&#39;t it cooler to see an expert winning with limited resources?&quot;, 

so Noel beats Nega-Noel.

* 3rd fight - Kohaku

Noel infiltrates the Toono residence as a housekeeper. 

But she fails to deceive the real housekeeper.

She attacks with a Kohaku-ryuu battou while Noel is distracted microwaving her lunch.

Meanwhile, the student who was supposed to be her safety line is chatting with the other maid in the library.

* 4th fight - Akiha

&quot;Perhaps your research wasn&#39;t thorough enough?&quot;,

argued the lady speculated to be Roa&#39;s incarnation, in the coldest tone she could muster.

&quot;(Oh. It&#39;s not her. This girl is not a vampire. She&#39;s something worse.)&quot;

Noel&#39;s natural danger sense told her to get away from the mansion fast.

That&#39;s when the boy in the uniform appeared.

&quot;Huh, you&#39;re leaving already? Then I&#39;m going with you. 

You don&#39;t have the key, do you, Ms. Noel?&quot;

&quot;Is that all you want written in your testament?&quot;

The lady completely dropped her intellectual act 

and her attack was heated as Hell. Elegantly.

* 5th fight - Roa

After some troubles, Noel manages to escape the Toono mansion 

and comes face to face with a suspicious individual.

&quot;Excuse me. You forgot to button up your shirt.&quot;

The suspicious man was insulted by the student&#39;s casual comment.

Here&#39;s starts the battle with the suspicious moving at lightning speeds.

* 6th fight - ??

//Noel discovers the suspicious man was Roa and earns her happy ending. But...

@Noel:

It&#39;s all over now?

What? Really?

I feel like something is wrong, something is missing...

Since this is my story, the villain of the last chapter should be...

//This is where she finally remembers Ciel.

@Noel:

I haven&#39;t seen her anywhere!

Even if I&#39;m the main character of this word,

we can&#39;t have my story without her!

None of this had any point!

@Student:

So, what are you trying to say here?

@Noel:

That this is all fake!

Even if my life here is happier than in the real world,

and I got a great boyfriend in you!

Something is wrong!

This is not my world!

I didn&#39;t even put any work into earning my heroine spot, to begin with!

Oh, no, no, I do want to be a heroine!

But that&#39;s a different matter!!

@Student:

You&#39;re not making much sense.

I can&#39;t see what you&#39;re getting at.

@Noel:

It&#39;s a matter of feeling,

no logic or interest involved!

We&#39;re breaking up!!

@Student:

Then I guess we must fight.

-&gt; Battle against the student (if possible, give him different voice clips)

-&gt; When she wins, do the classic &quot;they say goodbye as the world fades to white&quot; trope

@Student:

Bye. Stay well.

I know this is not your not your thing, but work as hard as you feel like you can.

//Down to the last moment, Nanaya is always a cold but very caring younger boyfriend.

//Noel is a bit sad but walks toward the light of awakening.

//In the light, the students fades in the distance. And in the end,

@Noel:

Oh, that&#39;s right. Why wasn&#39;t this the first thing I said?

HEY! WHAT&#39;S YOUR NAME?

TELL ME YOUR NAME BEFORE THIS IS OVER!

//The students gives a discontent response as he walks away. 

//&quot;Saying that would ruin the mood.&quot; The screen turns white after he answers.

*Epilogue

Ending epilogue.

My point is, summer is coming.</p><p>It&#39;s right around the corner, just a wait bit longer for your ticket to paradise to be issued.</p><p>It&#39;ll be a wonderful summer where you&#39;ll get plentiful materials... No doubts about it... Seriously, I have no Grails. I can&#39;t even raise one Servant to 120. Gimme Grails!</p><p>(Those are the harmful effects of thoughtlessly raising every Servant he loved to 100)</p><p>And I&#39;m very glad to see you&#39;re all respecting Tsukihime&#39;s no spoilers period.</p><p>Thanks a bunch for preserving the joys of facing the unknown for the players who are still reading and the players who want to read but are too busy right now!</p><p>I&#39;d appreciate if you preserved this mood for one more week, talking about the game with your like-minded friends in your personal chat spaces, using Fusetter to talk about it in public spaces, etc.</p><p>Tsukihime is a visual novel, so the fun of it is not in moving your character, like it is in action games. Its plot is its life.</p><p>That&#39;s why I had to ask you not to post spoilers on these two weeks.</p><p>I must mention that we discussed the matter with Fusetter beforehand and they gladly offered their cooperation.</p><p>Thank you very much, Fuseta.</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Sorry for the abrupt change of topic but let&#39;s talk about the Solomon movie.</p><p>It&#39;s already been a month since the debut, so I&#39;ll give some little behind-the-scenes stories and exposition on the parts that were difficult to understand.</p><p>(I&#39;ll touch the plot without any vagueness, so if you haven&#39;t watched the movie yet, please skip this section)</p><p><strong>Seventh Heaven Mystic Code</strong></p><p>Each of those seven bolts were the exact amount of fuel (magical energy) for one Servant summon.</p><p>The wearer can do simple summons without it, but that would put a lot of stress on their body, so the safety breaker on the suit&#39;s chest restricts them into being unable to summon without using the bolts.</p><p>As long as the breaker is there, the wearer can use all the bolts and that won&#39;t interfere with their vital functions (because they&#39;ll stop summoning before it can).</p><p>In the Lev fight, when Lev pointed out that all systems that try to do the impossible have flaws and shot his magecraft, he was aiming at the breaker.</p><p>Fujimaru guarded it perfectly though.</p><p>And that&#39;s why Lev begrudgingly praised his &quot;competent imitation (of a warrior)&quot;.</p><p>Now to the Goetia fight.</p><p>By the time of the Throne Solomon fight, he had already used 6 bolts and was down to his last one.</p><p>Mash&#39;s shield protected Fujimaru and Chaldea. (Goetia&#39;s Noble Phantasm was, you know, aiming at the actual Chaldea base behind them)</p><p>The doctor comes to close the match.</p><p>It&#39;s a situation where Fujimaru has to look for a way to beat Goetia with the last summon, but thanks to his fond memories of Mash and Romani in the Singularities, the Master faces &quot;the most intense moment of his life&quot;.</p><p>No matter how ordinary and commonplace he is, as a person who passed Singularities 1 through 7, his boiling determination reflects his gratitude to everyone he met along the way and his pride of having survived that far.</p><p>The Master, as the one human standing there, recites the &quot;What is Human Order Security?&quot; speech Goetia got when he joined Chaldea&#39;s personnel... The first piece of flavor text the Masters got in FGO.</p><p>At the same time, instead of summoning from the bolt, he destroyed his own safety breaker and made the most daring move he could:</p><p>A new summoning spell consuming his entire being to safeguard Human Order.</p><p>In response to this sacrifice, all Heroic Spirits erased by Nega Summon appear again as a meteor shower covering the entire sky.</p><p>Goetia answered to Fujimaru&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s you and me now, Goetia&quot; with &quot;Then come, Chaldea&quot;.</p><p>He said &quot;come, Chaldea&quot; instead of &quot;Fujimaru&quot; because he accepted Fujimaru&#39;s will.</p><p>Fujimaru&#39;s will here being &quot;I&#39;m not defeating you. These Heroic Spirits were called by the merits and feelings of the Chaldea personnel that was already safeguarding Human Order long before I was born&quot;.</p><p>That&#39;s was I told Nobunaga during the recording, at least.</p><p>I told him that speech was a line Fujimaru always repeated to himself in his room during his daily training, with how unexperienced he considers himself to be.</p><p>Adding to that, Fujimaru said &quot;We of Chaldea...&quot; in the movie, but in the original draft, he was going to say &quot;They of Chaldea...&quot;.</p><p>During the first test recording, I requested Nobunaga to put a special feeling in this line. Quoting myself:</p><p>&quot;Fujimaru really wants to say &#39;we&#39; here. He wants to present himself as a proud member of Chaldea. But knowing how long the staff persevered before he got there, he can&#39;t include himself just one year after joining. &#39;It&#39;s not me defeating you. It&#39;s the fruit of the labors of everyone in Chaldea. I&#39;m just representing them.&#39;.&quot;</p><p>Respecting this request, he delivered a most wonderfully heartfelt &quot;They of Chaldea...&quot;</p><p>But seeing the whole scene confirmed that this intent is hard to convey in a movie, so we changed that into &quot;We of Chaldea&quot;.</p><p>And Shimazaki&#39;s perfectly delivered &quot;We&quot; convey the same nuance with opposite words. He was not the only one trying his hardest... Everyone in Chaldea was... What a wonderfully passionate performance.</p><p>When the studio first sent me this line, I thought to myself &quot;Oh... This Fujimaru can go beyond LB6.&quot; It was a heartwarming experience.</p><p>As you can tell, the Solomon movie has a lot of dialogue not present in the source material.</p><p>Many parts were cut for length, so I hope I can publish the raw script one day.</p><p>That&#39;s all I have to say about Time.</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Sorry for the even more abrupt change of topic but I&#39;ll advertise Tsukihime now.</p><p>It&#39;s been one week since launch.</p><p>I believe a lot of people must have already beat Arcueid&#39;s route by now.</p><p>If you did, check this out.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iTCUZxi9_c</p><p>A disc with all openings and endings in Tsukihime is coming out!</p><p>In September 1st!

(Kinoko)</h2><p>Note: Contains LB6 Spoilers</p><p>It&#39;s been a week since the release of the Collapse Arc of Part 2, Chapter 6.</p><p>This has turned out to be the longest main chapter we&#39;ve published so far.</p><p>Once again, allow me to thank all of the development staff at DelightWorks,</p><p>the creators who designed the Servants and drew the backgrounds,</p><p>and of course, the staff of TYPE-MOON who for the past 3 months were like, &quot;We already knew this would happen, so what do you need us to do?&quot; and still put their heart and soul into making this happen.</p><p>It&#39;s been a grand dream, and it couldn&#39;t have come true without every single one of you.</p><p>Now, then. Since it seems like many players have completed the story, I&#39;ll spill a bunch of details even if it might be a bit early.</p><p>First, I know you&#39;re probably asking why I&#39;m calling it the Collapse Arc.</p><p>Chapter 6 was structured into three parts: the First Arc, Second Arc, and Collapse Arc.</p><p>During the stream right before the First Arc was released, it was compared to Kara no Kyoukai:</p><ul><li>First Arc: &quot;Garan no Dou&quot; from Kara no Kyoukai</li><li>Second Arc: &quot;Paradox Spiral&quot; from Kara no Kyoukai</li><li>Collapse Arc: &quot;A Study in Murder (II)&quot; from Kara no Kyoukai</li></ul><p>...are what was meant by that. The supposed final boss also similarly left the stage in medias res.</p><p>We intended to focus our resources on making the Collapse Arc, but the First and Second Arcs ballooned in volume,</p><p>and we kept making more and more assets and stills for them until all three arcs grew to be impactful on their own.</p><p>Also, I figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt to turn to the guy (company president) sitting next to me, whose hands were already full with the main work, and say,</p><p>&quot;I waNT BRidE poSES for Mash.</p><p>In TWO wEEks FRoM Now, IF yOU COuLD.</p><p>FOrGivE ME. foRgiVE mE. FoRgIVe me THE sInS OF kInoKo.&quot;</p><p>I sent that message using (physical) telepathy and in reply, he stunned me with entirely new portraits instead of just pose variations, and a huge amount of facial expressions too.</p><p>&quot;Well, that worked...</p><p>Maybe I could ask for the three fairies and Mike, too...</p><p>I&#39;ll ask BLACK-san to do the trio, and Simoshi-kun to work on Bogard!</p><p>Oh yeah, I can ask Shimoshi-kun to squeeze in Mike, too! They designed Da Vinci, after all!&quot;</p><p>And that&#39;s what we got.</p><p>In the plot, Mike was only to have a faceless mob fairy portrait, but I wanted him to leave more of an impression.</p><p>For Mike&#39;s design, I asked for &quot;lines that make him feel like a mob even though he&#39;s not. He shouldn&#39;t stand out during the First Arc, but it&#39;ll be really meaningful during the Collapse.&quot;</p><p>Thank you, Shimoshi! I&#39;m really looking forward to swimsuit Da Vinci-chan!</p><p>The musical score this time was nearly three times that of a typical main story chapter,</p><p>and KATE-kun fought until the very end to get that done.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d like individualized battle themes for each Fairy Knight.</p><p>The ____ in the Collapse Arc should have an arrangement of that... speaking of which, ____ should get the complete version.</p><p>Try to think of the Fairy Knight battles as only the starting skirmishes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm, hm. The motifs of Lancelot and Gawain are easy enough to understand, but what about Tristan?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A girl&#39;s hysterical thoughts. A blood-drenched stage. A dance musical, a brilliant stage, the girl herself is hell, something like that. In the style of CCC&#39;s Alter Ego battles.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Should I make ____&#39;s theme orchestral since it&#39;s a boss battle?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to. It&#39;s supposed to be a girl&#39;s happy (dancing) dream, so it should be a cheerful melody with some tempo. The stage is part of the climax, so it should enrapture the audience and make them wish they were happy to have been born! Or something like that. Think like, the most exciting moment of your life. Even if it was all a dream.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s why the stage spins round and round! I get it now! But can I say something? Why are you giving me such an awful job?&quot;</p><p>By the way, speaking of the track &quot;Land of Hope,&quot; it&#39;s actually the initial map theme that was submitted for Saber Wars 2.</p><p>When KATE-kun gave it to us, I thought it would be too perfect for the end of Chapter 6, so I said,</p><p>&quot;I want to use this in Chapter 6, so please keep this one under wraps for now.</p><p>I think we should arrange it for Castoria&#39;s Noble Phantasm; give the players a taste of it so it&#39;ll sound familiar to them.</p><p>At the very very end, I want to use an emotional arrangement of it. Thanks.&quot;</p><p>And that&#39;s how, for the past 2 years, I&#39;ve listening to &quot;Land of Hope&quot; and thinking about Spring Memories whenever I was moving around.</p><p>To me, that song is about seeking stars.</p><p>Okay, at this point people are going to start accusing me of rambling too much again, so I&#39;ll explain a bunch of trivia off the top of my head.</p><h3 id="more-lb6-story-trivia" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#more-lb6-story-trivia" aria-hidden="true">#</a> More LB6 Story Trivia</h3><p><strong>____ in the Garden of Lost Will</strong></p><p>Regarding [the name of the imprisoned] in the Garden of Lost Will, the person that appears at the end is generally a person that you unconsciously feel is pointing out &quot;the very hardest thing, the first thing that you yourself avoid confronting.&quot;</p><p>The Oberon that shows up at the end isn&#39;t the real one.</p><p><strong>Vivian of Orkney</strong></p><p>The leader of the Rain Clan recognized their sins and offered the Fairy of Paradise their love and affection.</p><p>These were Vivian&#39;s warm childhood days.</p><p>A dimly lit yet warm castle sunroom, where the rain never stops.</p><p>The girl dreamed of a fairytale-like kingdom where she had no duty to Avalon, where everyone could live in peace.</p><p><strong>Caster of Avalon</strong></p><p>Caster has no Spring Memories because, as the Fairy of Paradise, she had no fun memories to look back on.

The trailers are available on this website, so check them when you have the time. Captions aside, all screenshots in the trailers are from the final version of game. Assume the screen composition will be like that all the time.</p><p>◆</p><p>Hello again. It&#39;s been two weeks since the release of chapter 6 part 2. We still have one week until the ending, but I want you to put that aside for a moment to prepare for the daily festivals.</p><p>Yes. The Fate/Grand Order Fes 2021 started.</p><p>Even if we can&#39;t do a IRL event, we still have the internet...! I think having these intense shows every day can get a bit heavy, but I hope you enjoy these 6 days of 6th anniversary.</p><p>I&#39;ll participate in the Fes only as a regular FGO player. I know the titles of each project but nothing beyond that. (...because producing chapter 6... took me a lot of time...)</p><p>Despite thinking the Grand Exam is an insane idea, I&#39;m taking the challenge. I don&#39;t think I can get a 100/100, but a 90/100 sounds doable. That&#39;s the creator of this franchise talking.</p><p>◆</p><p>Grand Temple of Time: Solomon.</p><p>I got to watch the movie before everyone else. I just have one brief comment.</p><p>Everything I wanted to see was there!</p><p>The screenplay had a special format (Nasu writing the full story first and then they adapting that into a proper movie script), so some scenes were obviously omitted due to time constraints, but the final product was a movie good enough to make those cuts not matter in the bigger picture. It successfully adapted the game into a movie through a different approach from the Camelot movies. Not only that, but it also became a 90 minute traditional blockbuster everyone should watch. Anyways! Everyone who beat Part 1 needs to give it a try! Really!</p><p>The first 7 Singularities were missions to explore and return alive, but the Final Singularity is a mission to exterminate and win. The need to prioritize the Master&#39;s life is no longer applying. The Master uses his body and Magic Circuits to become a Servant-summoning weapon even if it kills him...</p><p>This is Fujimaru Ritsuka&#39;s role in the Final Singularity and Chaldea&#39;s responsibility in preserving Human Order. Chaldea was supposed to be a research facility but had to operate as an army for one year out of necessity. Make sure you don&#39;t miss their final mission.</p><p>The movie really made me wish you were required to watch it before you played the Garden of Lost Will in chapter 6 part 2.</p><p>Oh, by the way, the official English names for the &quot;saccharine dream&quot;, &quot;dusky abyss&quot;, &quot;despondency&quot;, and &quot;those without sin&quot; are New Home, Horizon, Lost Will, and Heavenly, respectively. &quot;Heavenly&quot; being from the scene where Merlin gets trapped.</p><p>◆</p><p>Note: Contains LB6 Spoilers</p><p>Since we already got in the subject of chapter 6, time for some inside stories. One of the authors who inspired Nasu to write his doujins was CHOCO, Fairy Knight Lancelot&#39;s designer. I can never forget 1999. Takeuchi said &quot;Doujins come in all shapes and forms. Take a look at this one.&quot;, and showed me his thickest book, CHOCOLATE GEOMETRY #0002. It was a shining star even for today&#39;s standards of quality, and it taught the young Nasu that there were a multitude of wonderful doujin magazines he didn&#39;t know about. Still, this volume was my own fateful encounter. The cover forced anyone to admit it had a high level of artistry and composition. Uncompromised design, stunning visuals, and refined book design... Everything about it shattered my views about the differences being pro and amateur. It was an astonishing accomplishment for the Nasu from the ages before internet, before computers, and when the closest convenience store was a 30 minute walk away.</p><p>&quot;If people can make books this good and have a place to distribute them, I want to see what I can do.&quot;</p><p>CHOCO&#39;s earnestness encouraged me when was somewhat skeptical about doujin activity. After that, my luck and my bonds blessed me with the opportunity to produce a game, and I spent the whole process dreaming of one day working with CHOCO, my dear father... And as usual, my bonds blessed me. I was having lunch with MahoHako&#39;s designer Imaizumi, when he suddenly dropped a &quot;I have CHOCO&#39;s number&quot;.</p><p>&quot;What... No way... (thunk)... But I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s busy with Xenoblade Chronicles 2 right now... Despite everything, I&#39;m an industry insider, so I know how things go... I want to meet him... I want to hire him... I want to make this long-standing dream come true... But I also don&#39;t want to meet him because I&#39;m fangirling too much... I want to watch him from a distance...&quot;</p><p>After about 6 seconds of fan anxiety, I took action and asked Imaizumi to introduce me because I wanted to hire him. Yes. That&#39;s how life goes. Opportunities never last forever. Throw away your shame and honor and eat the carrot dangling in front of you. That&#39;s the story of how I connected myself to CHOCO, my dear father.</p><p>&quot;Fate has this dragon named Albion, and she has to look like she&#39;s the one thing that doesn&#39;t belong to that world. Something like a sci-fi character in a fantasy land, perhaps. Like really out of place, really extraneous.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Could you be more specific. How extraneous, exactly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm, if every other character were Mobile Suits, this one is a Getter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Got it. Just to make sure, you&#39;re the real Kinoko Nasu and I will design a Fate/ Servant, right?&quot;</p><p>Lancelot started from this explanation. A few years later, I was finally set to start producing chapter 6, and I could request the long-waited CHOCO design. I want to take this moment to thank CHOCO for cheerfully accepting my unreasonable requests, and Imaizumi for tying us together. By the way, when I request a FGO Servant design, I take a lot of ideas from the illustrator. This includes ideas for weapons, facial expressions, dialogue, and Noble Phantasms. In Lancelot&#39;s case, I took CHOCO&#39;s ideas for all the things I just listed, but the finest example of this comes from his NP image boards. Lancelot&#39;s 3rd Ascension NP had already achieved perfect beauty since the earlies design stages.</p><p>◆</p><h3 id="lb6-part-2-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lb6-part-2-notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> LB6 Part 2 Notes</h3><p>Whew, that was long. Here are some quick chapter 6 bits that had to be kept out of the final script.</p><ul><li>Beryl&#39;s Command Spells:</li></ul><p>Beryl didn&#39;t use his Command Spells on Tristan. They didn&#39;t have a proper Servant contract, after all. For special character reasons, Beryl can use Command Spells on himself, and was planned to do so in the Black Wolf fight. But that had to be scrapped... for programming difficulties... We even got the voice lines recorded...</p><ul><li>The cause of Woodwose&#39;s death:</li></ul><p>The CG didn&#39;t make it clear enough, but Woodwose was finished off by Morgan&#39;s magecraft dagger. After taking a hit she could dodge from Woodwose, she realized it was too late for him (he was turning into Mohs) and stabbed his abdomen with a point-blank dagger. That&#39;s what that stab sound effect was about. Later, figuring out everything Morgan did, he regained his senses but became Mohs. Here he was supposed to aimless attack everything like normal Mohs do, but his love and respect to Morgan... his heartfelt sense of guilt and repentance... freed him from the Mohs curse and allowed him to vanish without violence.</p><ul><li>FGO Radio - Nemo&#39;s secret:</li></ul><p>Don&#39;t tell anyone, but here&#39;s what I wrote for the original version of Nemo&#39;s Valentine&#39;s scene.</p><p>Nemo Marine D: &quot;Really?! None of us is getting left out? Waaaaaah, I love you, Master!&quot;</p><p>Nemo havers, please check how this line turned out to be in the voiced version. What&#39;s my point?

You’re always so profound, Habenyan~”</p><p>After receiving such advice I dwelled a bit on it and as a result I made it in this kind of format, as to treat everyone kindly.</p><p>For this chapter, the more you advance, the more the quantity of information grows so take a breather after each chapter and enjoy it at your own leisure.</p><p>In addition, for this chapter we’ve arranged for a “travel memo”, a feature that you can check in-game.</p><p>As you advance a certain amount of chapters, an icon at the top-left of the screen will appear, looking at it you’ll be able to visually understand the Fairy Country’s history.</p><p>This will keep updating little by little in-game each time you acquire new information so you&#39;d do well to check it out after each chapter.</p><p>Filling out the annals of an unknown world might turn out to be quite enjoyable.</p><p>◆</p><p>Well then. Let’s get into the main topic.</p><p>Oberon. Umino Chika.</p><p>I’m sure everyone is aware of “Honey and Clover” and “March comes like a lion”, right?</p><p>For those who are, I&#39;m sure explaining won’t be necessary at this point.</p><p>For those fortunate enough to not have encountered them I won’t say anything mean, just please get running to the bookstore right now.</p><p>Whichever one of the two is fine. Though if possible I’d like you to start reading from “Honey and Clover”.</p><p>Umino Chika&#39;s manga contain all the trials and tribulations of (a nerd’s) life. They are simply fun, charming, enviable, heartrending, bitter and sad... but also inspiring.</p><p>Thinking back to it, it was 3 years ago, after an FGO livestream (Surprise Birthday).</p><p>It was the first time I talked to this scary fellow wearing sunglasses and a leather jacket in the flesh.</p><p>“Hm, this scary dude, he’s totally nice... practically a master at thoughtfulness...</p><p>Also... his eyes... are kinda beautiful... (heart racing) not that I can see them…</p><p>He really loves games... and can talk about Chrono Trigger all legit... damn dude…”</p><p>Before I&#39;d noticed, almost 2 hours of intense conversation had passed. Though we split up as the it was around time for the last trains of the day, we did manage to talk about “Honey and Clover” at this point.</p><p>For me, “Honey and Clover” is a very important work.</p><p>I can’t simply categorize it as an interesting work.</p><p>It&#39;s one of the mental pillars of support that lets me work hard when I’m struggling with my creativity.</p><p>(I get a little choked up at the episodes where Hagu is making things on all her lonesome)</p><p>Mafia: “If that’s that case, then how about meeting her? I might be able to set up a meeting.”</p><p>What do you mean ‘if that’s the case’, Muramasaaaaa!</p><p>He hit me with a direct attack out of the blue, as if he’d be ready to charge in right there and then.</p><p>And with that, before I knew what was happening, I&#39;d managed to meet with Umino Chika, as blessed by fate as I was.</p><p>I talked… a lot.</p><p>I splurted out 20 years of all my thoughts onto her.</p><p>“I&#39;ve been a fan since CUTiEcomic. I created this game called Tsukihime and then when we have the fandisk for it one of our staff-members called OKSG introduced me to this one manga, saying it would totally be up my alley and so I fell in love at first sight (volume). And with that, I looked around the bookstores for the previous magazines and managed to enjoy myself up to volume 2 but then the magazine it was published in was suspended... I mean what the heck…! As I despaired, it restarted serialization in YOUNG YOU and so out of sheer happiness, the three of us - me, OKSG and Takeuchi - went drinking while talking through how beautiful the world was. Humanity was alright after all. Yamada is so beautiful. Seeing as I am a wordsmith, I poured my attention over the line delivery and the monologues, like man Chika’s monologues are just so... keen... and heart-wrenching… yet so sincere and vulnerable, you write it so beautifully I’m afraid my heart as a creator is gonna break, it’s like your words as sharp as a knife powered up into words as sharp as a katana with “March comes like a lion”, I mean really take care of yourself... Still… I wanna see how it the continues, I want Shizuku to become happier than ever before! (snip) Perhaps one day we could work together on something... even if it gets me killed...&quot;</p><p>“Okay~ (warm smile). It might be a bit inconvenient as making adjustments to my schedule is quite difficult right now.&quot;</p><p>That’s no inconvenience at all, Muramasaaaaa!</p><p>That was around the time FGO Part 2 was starting.</p><p>It was already decided that Chapter 6 would be my responsibility so in my head I was just like,</p><p>“Oberon... Oberon! I’m gonna ask her for Oberon.</p><p>I’m gonna have Umino Chika draw me a fairy-tale character.</p><p>Is it okay to be this happy? It’s not.</p><p>Are you telling me this kinda chance happened in my lifetime? It seems so.</p><p>Oooooooohhhhhhh, Oberooooooooooooooon!”</p><p>It was nothing but that, essentially.</p><p>And so Umino said</p><p>“Oh Chapter 6 is going to be a fairy world you say? I wanna draw a cute girl☆”</p><p>While cackling and giggling to herself... but...</p><p>“It’s... a male character...</p><p>I want the kind of... this and that... of a Umino character... with that kinda blunt expression…”</p><p>And so I destroyed the dreams of an innocent little girl in all but 3 seconds. I apologize.</p><p>And with that, I had decided on how Oberon was to be introduced.</p><p>The instant the offer of Oberon went through, the way he was to be depicted had already been decided inside of me.</p><p>“Someone with a different presence from the usual Servant.</p><p>A guide to this fairy-tale world, who embodies the themes of Chapter 6.”</p><p>In order to carry out this concept I also requested this from Umino:</p><p>“There’s no need to try and fit in with FGO’s style. In Britain, I want Umino Chika’s drawings to be just as they are.”</p><p>And with that selfish request, Umino came back to me like a blazing fastball.</p><p>Though she was so, so busy, she arduously adjusted her schedule and lent us her help.</p><p>So I once again offer my gratitude to you, Umino.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>◆</p><p>It was the work that gave me strength as I was making the original Tsukihime.</p><p>That I could work together with its creator, and also</p><p>that it could be released in the same year as when Tsukihime R is being sold,</p><p>I really makes me feel like my life has become quite good... still...</p><p>There’s actually one more person in Chapter 6 who I’ve admired ever since the original Tsukihime’s production.</p><p>Or rather, one of the creators who served as the impetus for its creation is joining us now.</p><p>“Is this really a doujinshi!? It’s so big, cute and cool…!</p><p>To think there is a person who’d put out such a book on all their own...!”</p><p>This is already ages ago, I’m talking around the year 2000.</p><p>When the latter part of Chapter 6 is released I’ll talk about this once more.</p><hr><h2 id="_2021-5-13-showing-gratitude-as-a-representative-of-the-round-table-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2021-5-13-showing-gratitude-as-a-representative-of-the-round-table-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2021/5/13: Showing gratitude, as a representative of the Round Table (Kinoko)</h2><p>Long time no see.</p><p>I&#39;m back from a private showing of the second Camelot movie.</p><p>What a freaking masterpiece.</p><p>The first Camelot did as good as it could on its mandated role of providing the bare minimum explanations on what FGO is about, but other hand, it had to keep its momentum and flash on the low side, among other problems, all caused by the larger problem of the swirl of Corona messing the entire production schedule... (Thank you to the entire staff, including the director, for holding on until the very end...) With all that happened, I think the movie managed to shift into the second gear but never get to the third.</p><p>The moment the baton is passed to the second Camelot, things get ghastly.</p><p>90 minutes of pure &quot;The prequel already all the base exposition. Now it&#39;s we just run with a nonstop sequence of all the scenes everyone was wanting to see.&quot;</p><p>And they did it right. Every single was done with refined taste &amp; super quality...!</p><p>Everyone who played the game will go there thinking &quot;I want to see this scene&quot; and watch a scene 100 times better.</p><p>Despite my initial shock at their bold decisions on what to cut from the story, but on the first 5 minutes it already hit me that they cut all that because the viewer would be able to imagine what happened off-screen, and because they had a lot better things to show instead.</p><p>It&#39;s a huge sequence of scenes I wanted see, they exact way I wanted too see them from start to finish, but the real amazing part is the last 60 minutes. The war in the holy city.</p><p>They look good. All of them look good.</p><p>(Every character was highly reflective of their original designer&#39;s artstyle. To an almost uncanny level with Tristan in particular. I couldn&#39;t believe they could reproduce the complicated delicated of a Morii character)</p><p>On top of that, they&#39;re in a constant sequence of high-octane scenes that leave you with no room to breathe.</p><p>They go all out with the flashiness, but an earnest devotion to the original tone, without ever forgetting the main focus of the plot.</p><p>My honest opinion is that <strong>the entire movie is a theme park where you to an exciting new attraction every 5 minutes and pretty much every attraction feels like the main attraction,</strong> but if I had to pick just one, it&#39;d be the final battle against the Lion King.</p><p>The dialogue confronting the Lion King was <em>scripted so specifically for the game format</em> that I honestly had already given up on the idea of <em>finding a way to make that look good in the movie.</em> And yet, their fantastic direction and cinematography managed to <strong>materialize the excitement of playing the game.</strong></p><p>They did better than the game, to an extent, even.</p><p>As someone who has been following Arthuria since /stay Night, all I can say about the Lion King fight is... &quot;I saw something beautiful.&quot;</p><p>A spoiler warning here... although people who didn&#39;t watch it wouldn&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about.</p><p>No line in the Lion King fight&#39;s script says &quot;This scene goes with this image.&quot;</p><p>That means all the beauty of the that fight comes from the raw power of the director and the animation staff (the director personally storyboarded this one!).</p><p>All his creativity and the good sense necessary to make it real! This director is insane. I want more!</p><p>I get why they co-credited the director on the script.</p><p>He took the second movie&#39;s script as a guideline rather than hard rules, attentively directed everything from storyboards to editing, and stylishly reconstructed everything into <strong>one spectacle.</strong></p><p>Again, this is just my personal opinion, but I&#39;m considering what was done here to be <strong>the best way to adapt a videogame every player plays differently into a movie.</strong></p><p>The image quality is consistently throughout the whole movie, with every Round Table battle being terrific.</p><p>The Hassans, Pharaohs, and Sanzang were all beautiful and refined.</p><p>You&#39;d be hard pressed find another superhuman knight battle movie as extravagant as this.</p><p>Also, fans of <strong>battles inside giant crumbling buildings,</strong> prepare to see your dreams on the screen.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe they made that scene 30-minutes long. Are the director and animators Berserkers?</p><p>And those were all my heat-of-the-moment impressions...</p><p>I know a lot of movie theaters are closed in the current state of emergency, but if you can find the time and theater near you, please come savor this excitement.</p><p>It&#39;s perfectly fine if you <em>can&#39;t remember a lot of what happened in Camelot but remembers having fun with it!</em></p><p>It&#39;s been 4 years since Camelot&#39;s release, after all!</p><hr><h2 id="_2021-2-10-valentine-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2021-2-10-valentine-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2021/2/10: Valentine (Kinoko)</h2><p>Valentine&#39;s Day, 2021</p><p>This is the first time I&#39;ve been able to get a good look at it.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what to make of it, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s worth it.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what to make of it.</p><p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree with me.</p><p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree with me.</p><p>But this time, I&#39;d like to give you a little more information before the event starts.</p><p>This time, the event was announced in advance at the Winter Caravan.</p><p>(Only this time, we wanted to be informed 4 days before the event, not 1 day before.</p><p>However, we can&#39;t disclose all the information.</p><p>Instead of showing the servants, we asked them to hide the event title.</p><p>This was done in order to hide the name of Caren&#39;s &quot;Spiritual First&quot;, and it was really for no other reason.</p><p>It&#39;s a hollow event divided into day and night parts.</p><p>I&#39;ll tell you more about this dreamy story sometime ......</p><p>The scale of the event will be the same as the annual Valentine&#39;s Day event.</p><p>For the main event, I will be supervising the dialogue and</p><p>I had a lot of fun writing the mini-scenarios for the servants I was in charge of.</p><p>There&#39;s also one thing I&#39;d like to add about Caren in her My Room.</p><p>&quot;In Caren&#39;s My Room voice.</p><p>&quot;Caren&#39;s My Room voice doesn&#39;t have a line for a character with whom she has a deep relationship.</p><p>You&#39;ll probably notice this immediately, but of course it&#39;s a specification.</p><p>Caren is very energetic this time, she talks to many people she knows, but</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not going to touch that character.</p><p>The shattered piece of glass is not in Chaldea.</p><p>It is a confession that can only be made in the four days of promise.</p><p>So, the 2021 Valentine&#39;s Day event is almost here.</p><p>I have a sweet feeling about this year too.</p><hr><h2 id="_2020-8-24-untitled-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2020-8-24-untitled-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2020/8/24: Untitled (Kinoko)</h2><p>Power....</p><p>Powweerr...</p><p>Aaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaa....</p><p>◆</p><p>Damnit, my mind is in shambles.</p><p>It’s at times like these that I listen to Abi’s pancake song...</p><p>It melts my brain...</p><p>Actually, I did the checks of the text for these current shop voice-lines from Abi, but it&#39;s only now that I play it on my phone that I hear them for the first time...</p><p>Meteo... now you&#39;ve gone and done it, Meteo...!</p><p>(You see, the writer in charge of the Servant explains how the acting should be when we’re doing the recordings)</p><p>You can’t just do that.</p><p>You really can’t.</p><p>To think the Director of the Gentlemen’s Re-education Center is her...</p><p>Isn’t the magnificent Valentine 1 year too early?

I think it lent the presence of an unusual enemy, something never before seen in Fate.</p><p>Having received these background settings, I-IV did the design drafts of the Machine-Gods, and then DW did the designs and animations.</p><p>Machine-God Ares’ design was done by Huke on account of his connection to Altera, with it being the Divine Core that crossed over to Rome and all.</p><p>He&#39;s got an orthodox approach different from the 12 Machine-Gods of Olympus, rustic and militaristic, on top of being stylish and super cool...!</p><p>I’m sure there were many players who didn’t notice that you could use him as a type of Master Skill during the final battle.</p><p>That war-god can, because of my own little request, hit Zeus up and down, and remove his dumb annoying defense buffs, you know?</p><p>Great Full Armor - Kumano was designed by RAITA, on account of his connections with Kintoki.</p><p>Black Barrel - Round was designed by Hirai Yukio, who we are much indebted to for his work on Shadow Border, among others.</p><p>They were not able to sortie onto the battle screen but both were wonderful designs. Thanks as always!</p><p>Well then. Let&#39;s talk about this &quot;Greece arc&quot; then.</p><p>As usual, the Chapter writer’s role was everything from the landing and until the defeat of the Lostbelt King, as before.</p><p>My role then was taking that and doing general re-writes, adding the introduction and ending - the plot details and stories that bridge the Chapters and so on.</p><p>Still, this time around I was also allowed to participate as a writer.</p><p>The climax of Part 2’s turning point... As it’s the script where the story of the Crypters briefly comes to an end, that final conclusion is the duty of the script supervisor.</p><p>That’s right. Olympus was the end of the Crypter arc.</p><p>(The truth of the Crypters has yet to be revealed but what I mean is that they’ve been released from their roles as the current enemy)</p><p>What in Part 1 was Chapter 4, around the point when Soloman appears.</p><p>Chaldea’s journey still has a ways to go, so I’d like it if you&#39;d think of it as their direction changing a bit.</p><blockquote><p>The Alien God who has finally revealed itself (?).</p><p>The mischievous Disciples who have started doing whatever they feel like.</p><p>The remaining Crypters. The two remaining Lostbelts.</p><p>The records of Bluebook.</p><p>What exactly lies past the Wiped Blank Earth?</p><p>As always, please look forward to more “Fate/Grand Order”</p></blockquote><hr><p>Right, from hereon I’ll talk behind-the-scenes for some characters I’ve hand-picked.</p><ul><li>Caenis</li></ul><p>It’s been two years since their appearance in Part 2’s Opening Animation. Our Mr. Ms. Caenis has finally been added!</p><p>...Caenis was actually delivered to us in 2015, so we’re not even talking about before the start of Part 2, in fact this illustration has been here since Part 1. Among the FGO characters, they&#39;re actually part of the old-timer gang, rivaling Red Hare.</p><p>I’m sorry for making you wait so long, Azusa! Not only did you wait so long with a smile on your face, but also happily undertook some sprite additions in the eleventh hour. My greatest thanks to you...!</p><p>I left the background setting of Caenis to the other writers but</p><p>They were a servant of a special pattern, as I took charge of them within each script.</p><p>As their relationship with Kirschtaria was an element that spans across the various Chapters, it&#39;s true that only I, being the general supervisor, could do it.</p><p>As for this crude and violent Caenis, I think you can guess at their true feelings now that you know their conclusion and can look back.</p><p>This was especially strong when they lost during Atlantis. Who was it they could not afford dying because of?</p><p>Caenis’ screams were not a plea for their life, but rather a plea in order to save him.</p><p>Also, I had to have some exclusive lines for the last battle and so after testing the waters in asking for a supplementary recording session, it turned out we were blessed by the voice actors schedule being open and got an OK!</p><p>In that sense, a super luxurious Servant. Hey, are you really a 4-star?</p><hr><ul><li>Kirschtaria</li></ul><p>Everyone&#39;s favorite apple-providing bigger brother.</p><p>Why did he introduce himself when the earth was Blank Slated in the Prologue with “I am Kirschtaria Wodime”?</p><p>I mean usually at that point there’d be no need to do so.</p><p>Putting aside that he’d basically already secured victory, it goes without saying that remaining anonymous would be to his advantage with his greatest enemy in Chaldea still remaining.</p><p>Yet, Kirschtaria did not do so.</p><p>That was a declaration of intent concerning the Editing of Human Order, and also a proclamation for the purpose of making it clear that the responsibility of destroying Pan Human History laid with him.</p><p>Also, the reason why Kirschtaria’s 6th and 7th skill are like that is because,</p><p>“Beyond there I was always alone” and</p><p>“There were no memories sufficient in supporting my body from my journey there.”</p><hr><ul><li>Pino (the boy under the bridge)</li></ul><p>Pino is a moniker that I secretly added as I was writing. This name does not appear in the main story.</p><p>I asked Takenashi Eri to do the design and sprites. Indeed, I used my connections to the fullest!</p><p>Someone who doesn’t give off a presence of more than just a background character, fundamentally creepy and menial, yet that final expression...</p><p>A character with a very difficult, yet important role, and so I just had to get Takenashi’s touch.</p><hr><ul><li>U - Olga Marie -</li></ul><p>Sorry for keeping you waiting. So we have finally arrived here.</p><p>The U is the U of Ultra.</p><p>“If - just what if - I turned into a being that rules over the earth, then what title would I give myself…?</p><p>Super... Hybrid... No, not that, it’s gotta be Ultra, right!”</p><p>Whether she thought this or not is unclear, but I at least think it’s entirely possible.</p><p>(Look it up)</p><p>So I requested for her design to be ultra monster-ish. No, not that kinda ultra.</p><p>Also, that single sword stroke was the end of Muramasa’s job, and so that appearance comes from her own disposition.</p><p>“Seems I got some more work to do” as per Muramasa.</p><hr><ul><li>The protagonist’s feelings.</li></ul><p>During the latter half, from the part where you hear about Kirschtaria from Pepe (about them being equals, both in terms of ability and circumstances) a spark lights up in the protagonist’s feelings, becoming one of fighting, rather than one of restoring.</p><p>With the words imparted as the team-up with Caenis ended after the battle with Chaos, this spark has clearly erupted into a flame, going from fighting for the sake of the Human Order, to wanting to beat Kirschtaria as a fellow Master.</p><p>In being recognized more so than anyone else by an opponent who they thought they had no chance against, they can give it their all more so than ever.</p><p>This loosened the protagonist’s heart who previously fearfully froze up thinking they had to repair the Human Order, to now being returned to the same state as in the finale of Part 1 of just wanting to defeat what&#39;s in front of them, with all their might.</p><p>They believed in themselves, for the sake of someone who believed in them more than they did.</p><p>With that in mind, I requested that the battle with Kirschtaria in Atlantis be balanced not as to be an overwhelming show of power, but one strong enough where it’s winnable if the players pulled out their everything so they’d feel like “damn, he’s strong, but this is it!”.</p><p>So when players who really managed to win popped up I smiled in satisfaction, while also thinking “3 turning it is overdoing it, Medb!”</p><p>So. At the time, there was a Kirschtaria defeat voice-line just in case of players winning but I decided to scrap it as it would give away Kirschtaria’s true nature if used in Atlantis.</p><p>It’s not much but I present this to those of you who have beaten Olympus.</p><p>(I&#39;ve already gotten permission from DW)</p><p><a href="http://www.typemoon.org/bbb/diary/img/%E3%82%AD%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E6%95%97%E5%8C%971.wav" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audio Link<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p>Yes.

And so I had the honor of writing “Chaldea - Zero”.</p><p>The A-Part is Romani Archiman’s journey.</p><p>The B-Part is Mashu’s upbringing and her growth up until Chapter 6, as a milestone towards Chapter 7.</p><p>And with this, I could hand over the baton to the protagonist, Fujimaru Ritsuka...

In short, he&#39;s someone who can&#39;t quit.</p><p>→→</p><p>First Spoiler (revealed in the middle and later half of the story)</p><p>His identity is the same as that of the NPCs on campus, merely &quot;recreated data from past humans.&quot;</p><p>(It is less expensive for the Moon Cell to model NPCs after past humans, but the Moon Cell fundamentally cannot understand humans (intelligent life forms))</p><p>He gained a self and passed the preliminary round as a human, so he was registered as a Master.</p><p>→→</p><p>Second Spoiler (revealed at the end of the story)</p><p>The human he was recreated from is in cold sleep on Earth, neither alive nor dead.</p><p>This is why the NPC managed to gain an ego and autonomy.</p><p>(This has to do with where souls reside in TYPE-MOON, but that isn&#39;t explained in this story.)</p><ul><li>Saber (Nero)</li></ul><p>The Servant who was summoned in response to Hakuno&#39;s call.</p><p>(Summoning details are in Material, under Saber&#39;s entry.)</p><p>A female knight who acts as she pleases and whole-heartedly glorifies life.</p><p>Her speech and attitude are pompous, but at her core, she respects all that is beautiful.</p><p>She appears condescending, but actually reacts to most things with a &quot;wow, that&#39;s amazing. How impressive! But I won&#39;t lose, either!&quot; attitude.</p><p>Her physical abilities are below average for a Servant, but her Skill &quot;Imperial Privilege&quot; is powerful. A true genius displays her talents in all areas. Red Saber&#39;s strength can be considered her ability to learn anything that is possible through human levels of effort or talent.</p><p>Saber is reluctant to reveal her true name.</p><p>It is not because she wishes to conceal her identity as the infamous tyrant Nero, but because she is afraid that Hakuno will dislike or be disappointed with her if he knows her name.</p><p>During the fifth round, she moves past this hesitation and reveals it herself.</p><ul><li>Girl Classmate (Female Protagonist)</li></ul><p>A girl who occasionally crosses paths with Hakuno, leaving him a casual word of advice.</p><p>She&#39;s always eating a noodle sandwich.</p><p>She wasn&#39;t in the PSP version, so the audience would misread her as &quot;a new heroine!?&quot;</p><p>→→</p><p>Spoiler (Round 7)</p><p>The same entity as Hakuno. Personnel data: a NPC created by SE.RA.PH, modeled after Kishinami Hakuno. However, she was configured as a female due to overlapping identity.</p><p>She gained an ego in connection with the same event for Hakuno, and advanced as a Master.</p><p>(※ She didn&#39;t gain a soul. Hakuno gained a soul, and the aftermath of this awakened her ego.)</p><p>Because her data was modified further after recreation, she quickly becomes aware that she is not a legitimate being.</p><p>As a degraded copy, she cannot withstand the installation of an ego (soul), so she is destined to disintegrate.</p><p>(※ Even if she wins the seventh round, she will then disappear. Only Archer deduces this.)</p><ul><li>Archer (Nameless)</li></ul><p>The Female Protagonist&#39;s Servant. He is a Servant summoned to a Master without a soul, so his summoning circumstances are also irregular.</p><p>Half of his body is crumbling and burned.</p><p>Knowing the Female Protagonist&#39;s situation, he helps her fight to the bitter end.</p><p>→ Every time Hakuno is alone and in a pinch, Archer saves him. As for why he does this, if Hakuno dies, so does the female protagonist. Archer is trying to give his Master a conclusion where she doesn&#39;t lose until the very end, and accepts her end even though she couldn&#39;t survive.</p><p>→→ Archer is partially destroyed, so Nero and Tamamo don&#39;t recognize him in the world of EXTELLA. Also, the Nameless that appears in EXTELLA comes from a world where the Female Protagonist won.</p><ul><li>Rin &amp; Rani</li></ul><p>Fewer appearances than in the PSP version, but their position is unchanged.</p><ul><li>Leo</li></ul><p>The heir to the Western European Conglomerate. A perfect prince. The strongest foe in the PSP version.</p><p>His role is the same in the PSP version, but this time he is defeated in the sixth round.</p><p>→→ Foreshadowing</p><p>Out of curiosity, Leo talks to Kishinami Hakuno many times, but several of the conversations are inconsistent.</p><p>&quot;Oh, didn&#39;t we talk about this before?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;m interested in you, too.&quot;</p><p>He says things like that, because he&#39;s interacted with the Female Protagonist in the same way.</p><p>Leo loses to the Female Protagonist in the sixth round, so this time, he realizes that the Female Protagonist has the potential to defeat him.</p><ul><li>Saber (Gawain)</li></ul><p>Leo&#39;s Servant. Unchanged from the PSP version.</p><ul><li>Julius</li></ul><p>Leo&#39;s older brother. An assassin who handles the dirty work. On Earth, he doesn&#39;t have much time left to live.</p><p>He eliminates Leo&#39;s enemies without regard for his own survival.</p><p>His position is unchanged from the PSP version. He is openly hostile to Hakuno, and is Hakuno&#39;s greatest rival.</p><p>Julius&#39; special animosity towards Hakuno (and the Female Protagonist) is because Hakuno is the same type of person as Julius.</p><p>On a deeply subconscious level, Julius rejects the notion that a normal person, possessing nothing and chosen by nobody, could rise to become Leo&#39;s greatest enemy.</p><p>It also stems from Julius&#39; irritation that he was unable to do the same.</p><ul><li>Assassin (Li Shuwen)</li></ul><p>Julius&#39; Servant. Position is unchanged from the PSP version.</p><ul><li><p>Matou Shinji</p></li><li><p>Rider (Drake)</p></li></ul><p>The opponent in the first round, which has the theme of fighting a friend. Unchanged from the PSP version.</p><ul><li>Atrum</li></ul><p>The opponent in the fourth round. His Servant is Caster (Tamamo no Mae).</p><p>A new Master for the EXTRA storyline that was reorganized for EXTELLA. A user of sacrificial magic that kills and creates life.</p><p>Acquainted with Leo on Earth. In the world of EXTRA where fossil fuel resources have run dry, he lacks the cockiness and carelessness of his Fate/stay night counterpart. However, his basic personality is the same.</p><p>A self-proclaimed feminist, but it&#39;s obvious in reality that he views women only as tools.</p><p>He speaks respectfully to Caster, but also looks down on her.</p><p>After the Moratorium of Round 4, he sends Caster to seduce Hakuno (to gain his sympathy).</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t need win the boy over. As long as you can ensnare him, it&#39;ll be a windfall for us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Me? I have things to do. Dirty jobs are a Servant&#39;s duty, right?&quot;</p><p>Casko wearily follows his order, replying &quot;By your command.&quot;</p><p>After dispatching Casko, Atrum accesses a proprietary hidden circuit to Earth to find data on Kishinami Hakuno, but fails to turn up anything. This troubles him.</p><p>After Atrum loses to Hakuno in their duel, Atrum uses Caster as a scapegoat to avoid the destruction of his own body, and flees.</p><p>After he escapes from the firewall, he is dealt with by Julius or the Moon Cell.</p><ul><li>Caster (Tamamo no Mae)</li></ul><p>Appears as Atrum&#39;s Servant.</p><p>From the start, she is aware that she is expendable to Atrum, but she does not resist fulfilling their pact. (Of course, if Atrum were to sever their contract, it would be a different story.)</p><p>When she comes to Hakuno on Atrum&#39;s orders to seduce him, Hakuno asks,</p><p>&quot;...Umm, I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re doing this,&quot;</p><p>which confuses her.</p><p>Fox: &quot;I suppose, in short, that my Master&#39;s naive strategy is to have me drown you in my charms and end you in your sleep. Failing that, sympathy might still move you to carelessness during your final duel...&quot;</p><p>Having heard Casko&#39;s circumstances and taking issue with them, Hakuno becomes serious.</p><p>Hakuno: &quot;Have a seat, Caster.&quot;</p><p>Hakuno kneels across from Caster.</p><p>Casko does the same. Hakuno begins to give her a stern lecture out of concern for her well-being.</p><p>This is the first event that leads to Caster falling in love.</p><p>After their duel, Casko burns away, as Atrum&#39;s scapegoat.</p><p>The protagonist then uses his Command Spell to try and save her.</p><p>Casko is restored, without a scratch. &quot;Ah, I&#39;m finally free!&quot; The way she easily withstands the assault of the firewall is similar to Arcueid&#39;s scene.</p><p>Afterwards, she cooperates with Hakuno as his (self-declared) true Servant.</p><p>Nero: &quot;Damn you -- who let this raccoon- no, this fox into our den!?&quot;</p><p>Fox: &quot;That&#39;s obvious. As if the curse of a third-rate Master could roast me!&quot;</p><ul><li><p>Dan</p></li><li><p>Archer (Robin)</p></li></ul><p>The opponent in the second round, which has the theme of defeating one&#39;s senior and mentor in life.</p><p>Position is unchanged from the PSP version.</p><ul><li>Twice Pieceman</li></ul><p>The final Master who awaits Hakuno in front of the Moon Cell&#39;s core, after the seventh round.</p><p>Position is unchanged from the PSP version.</p><p>However, to make his appearance less sudden, he would appear frequently throughout the story.</p><p>※ He could also interact with the Female Protagonist instead of Hakuno.</p><p>PART II</p><p>Continuing on...</p><p>◆</p><h3 id="reorganization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reorganization" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reorganization</h3><p>※ This is basically meant to be a shorter version of the plot, so it only contains the essentials. Unfortunately, I have to cut the excess fat.</p><p>※ That said, in the end this is a reorganization of the Nero route. There are differences from the Tamamo no Mae and Nameless routes. For example, in the Tamamo route, the event that occurs on the path to the core is completely opposite.</p><ul><li>Awakening ~ Preliminary Round ~ Servant Summoning</li></ul><p>From the top...</p><p>&quot;A girl falls on the water&#39;s surface, lying face up. It&#39;s the Female Protagonist before she disappears, after losing to Hakuno in the sixth round.&quot;</p><p>This scene would be interesting to include. The audience would be misled to believe she was someone who died in the preliminaries, but the truth would be revealed in after the sixth round.</p><p>※ This is just meant to be a surprise scene, without any bearing on the story. It doesn&#39;t have to be included.</p><p>The protagonist notices the incongruity in school life, escapes from the Inside of the World (the Inside of the Texture), fights a doll, and summons a Servant.</p><p>Unchanged from the introduction to the PSP version.</p><ul><li>Round 1, Beginning</li></ul><p>Round 1 begins while the mood is still carefree, while explaining SE.RA.PH., the Moon Cell, the Holy Grail War, and the state of Earth.</p><p>The atmosphere of Round 1 is &quot;this is a game,&quot; &quot;this is a proxy war,&quot; and &quot;this feels like a game.&quot;</p><p>The opponent in the first round is announced. Hakuno faces Shinji.</p><p>→ In the PSP version, the opponent in each round was announced on a bulletin board, but if we have the budget, I&#39;d like to make it more flashy this time.</p><p>We could show the audience the tournament brackets and where each character is.</p><p>Also, the Masters can casually face off in in the halls, and we can also have Casko smugly appear.</p><ul><li>Round 1, Conclusion</li></ul><p>Events from the competition against Shinji, to the elevator ride, until the final duel.</p><p>Demonstrates that this isn&#39;t a game, but rather a ruthless battle for survival.</p><p>Drake: &quot;Don&#39;t you all realize that you were dead as soon as you got here?&quot;</p><p>They were all a great herd of fools lured in by the colorful promise that their wishes would be granted.</p><p>Of course, some were staking their lives on the competition, but the majority of them had been deceived.</p><p>Even Hakuno is troubled. &quot;What reason and wish do I have for fighting in this war for survival?&quot;</p><p>→→ Point</p><p>It left a bad taste in his mouth to join this tournament with neither convictions nor goals, and fight his own friend.</p><p>It struck him that unmindful murder and innocent fights to the death → Real death.</p><p>Shinji: &quot;I thought it just granted wishes! Why do I have to die!?&quot;</p><p>Drake: &quot;Look, that&#39;s just what it means to live. All people are unaware that they trample on the wishes of others.&quot;</p><ul><li>Round 2</li></ul><p>The heartbroken protagonist fights Dan, the old soldier.</p><p>The old man who fights with regrets about his life, and the Heroic Spirit Robin who died in regret.</p><ul><li>Round 3</li></ul><p>Round 3 is unchanged from the PSP version.</p><p>After Hakuno wins, his next opponents Atrum and Casko appear to put on haughty airs. &quot;You face us next, oh ho ho.&quot;</p><ul><li>Round 4</li></ul><p>Atrum is a character related to both Leo and Earth, so he serves the supporting but important role of explaining much of the setting, such as the state of Earth, and how it ended in the 2030s.</p><p>Atrum affects goodwill, taking the &quot;you should lose, so that I can live to save the world&quot; approach to sway Hakuno&#39;s resolve.</p><p>Hakuno, who has no identity, hesitates. However, he overcomes Atrum&#39;s intimidation by realizing that although Atrum&#39;s words are true, Atrum himself is not. They fight as Masters.</p><p>As a result of the duel against Atrum, Casko decides to help Hakuno while avoiding detection by the Moon Cell. She becomes a useful and helpful friend.</p><p>Of course, she schemes to defeat Nero and take her place as the main Servant, given an opening.</p><p>Nero is aware of this, naturally. Casko and Nero share a friendly, combative relationship.</p><p>→Their relationship is changed from &quot;heroines of different worlds&quot; to &quot;heroines in the same world.&quot;</p><ul><li>Round 5</li></ul><p>Hakuno fights Julius in the fifth round.</p><p>Nero is rendered unable to fight by Assassin&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p>With Casko&#39;s assistance, Hakuno challenges Julius and Assassin on his own.</p><p>Thanks to Hakuno&#39;s efforts, Nero recovers, and the story proceeds as it does in the latter half ot the PSP version.</p><p>After Nero recovers, she tells Hakuno her true name. Her Noble Phantasm is finally unsealed.</p><ul><li>Missing Chapter</li></ul><p>This is when CCC takes place. Casko remembers all of it. Nero only remembers, &quot;Elizabeth is my lifelong rival. But which round did we fight in?&quot;</p><ul><li>Round 6 ~ early Round 7</li></ul><p>Rin and Rani are defeated in round 6, and say their farewells.</p><p>Hakuno anticipates a showdown with Leo next... but Leo is reported to have been defeated.</p><p>Leo has fallen, but the name of the Master who proceeded to round 7 is hidden by jamming, and the Master is nowhere to be found.</p><p>Casko and Saber attempt to investigate, but they are unable to either locate the Master or remove the mosaic obscuring its name.</p><p>In a dramatic development, they realize, &quot;what if they aren&#39;t hiding? What if their name was always this way to begin with?&quot; They proceed on the assumption that their next opponent is nameless.</p><p>They report this irregularity to the priest, but the priest answers, &quot;No. In a sense, your next battle is fair.&quot;</p><p>Hakuno enters the elevator, not knowing who his next foe will be. No one is next to him.</p><p>When he arrives at the arena, it&#39;s a wasteland resembling the Grand Canyon.</p><p>Hakuno and the Female Protagonist face off, separated by a valley.</p><p>The enemy Master was his classmate. &quot;Ah, I knew it,&quot; Hakuno says in understanding.</p><p>The girl: &quot;Let&#39;s begin, Archer. This is my final fight.&quot;</p><p>Archer appears in response to her order, facing Nero.</p><p>The girl dispels the texture concealing her true face.</p><p>There she stands, aloof, her hair blowing in the wind.</p><p>For a moment, the story switches to the girl&#39;s perspective.</p><p>It&#39;s the story of a girl who suddenly woke up like Hakuno did, and strove to move forward in spite of her lack of self and her impending collapse.</p><p>The Female Protagonist&#39;s fight against Leo is the same as Round 7 of the PSP version.</p><p>→ Even though it was against the Female Protagonist, Leo still lost to &quot;Kishinami Hakuno.&quot;</p><p>Round 7 concludes. Archer disappears along with the girl.</p><p>The Male Protagonist inherits the girl&#39;s memories and details of her fight with Leo as his own.</p><ul><li>End of Moratorium ~ On the way to the core</li></ul><p>While traveling the path to the core of the Moon Cell, Hakuno is attacked by a debugging program.</p><p>Its target is Casko, not Hakuno. The Moon Cell is enraged that a Servant which should have been defeated is still intact.</p><p>→ Hakuno parts ways with Casko. The tone is similar to parting with Casko in the CCC Route of CCC. The debugging is powerful enough to actually erase her in CCC, but the debugging is light in this case, so Casko won&#39;t disappear.</p><p>Casko schemes to capture the Protagonist&#39;s heart and affections by risking her life (which is in no actual danger) in a heart-rending farewell, after sharing a tender scene with him. Nero sees right through it.</p><p>&quot;Come back out here!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll beeeeee baaaaaaaack!&quot;</p><p>&quot;She&#39;ll live,&quot; remarks Hakuno, as he dons his sunglasses.</p><p>Hakuno and Saber arrive at the Moon Cell&#39;s core. There, they face Twice.</p><ul><li>Moon Cell Core ~ Savior</li></ul><p>Hakuno confronts Twice. Twice gives a long speech.</p><p>※ The events here are described in the final entry of the Material glossary.</p><p>His thoughts breaking down, Hakuno has a showdown with Twice.</p><p>T: &quot;No Servant can reach me. After all, heroes are little more than flowers that bloom in each age.</p><p>He who saves the world. My answer is he who saves humanity.&quot;</p><p>The Servant Savior appears.</p><p>The duel against Twice becomes a reflection on human history in the Common Era.</p><p>&quot;All this consumption and bloodshed, and this is the conclusion we reach?&quot; laments Twice solemnly.</p><p>&quot;So what!?&quot; roar Nero and Hakuno in defiance.</p><p>Twice is correct. Humanity is not.</p><p>Yet, the final role and responsibility to decide and enforce what is right belongs to the people living in the current era.</p><p>It would be even more unacceptable to have it decreed by a ghost from the past.</p><p>After Twice is defeated, the ending of the PSP version proceeds to the Saber Route ending of CCC, and the story feels like it connects to EXTELLA.</p><p>It leads to a new beginning that collects all of the previous components.</p><p>That said, in the end this reorganization is supposed to be vague, in the sense that &quot;this seems to have happened.&quot;</p><p>For example, the tense but inseparable relationship between Nameless and Cu Chulainn, Gilgamesh and Artoria&#39;s connection, and other factors aren&#39;t described in EXTRA and CCC. I hope that the audience will accept that these fuzzy connections similar to the ones from Fate/stay night might have existed in the EX world, too.</p><p>◆</p><p>That&#39;s one portion of the materials from before we began developing EXTELLA.</p><p>It&#39;s just background for the story which will never appear as a concrete title, so don&#39;t worry about the typos.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this, even if it was just my thinking &quot;hmm, this is how we might need to redefine multi-route games that continue as a series.&quot;</p><hr><h2 id="_2016-10-15-today-s-meeting-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2016-10-15-today-s-meeting-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2016/10/15: Today&#39;s Meeting (Kinoko)</h2><p>Everybody makes mistakes.</p><p>Kinoko is prone to jumping to conclusions.</p><p>That&#39;s the kind of creature I am.</p><p>■■</p><p>At yesterday&#39;s regular meeting.</p><p>We&#39;d pretty much gotten through the agenda, and were on our way to the next stop when Shiocchi approached me apologetically.</p><p><strong>Shiokawa-san:</strong></p><p>&quot;Nasu-san, actually, something&#39;s been troubling me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Nasu Kino:</strong></p><p>&quot;Yes, what is it?

In other words,</p><p>&quot;As planned&quot; means it was decided a year ago.</p><p>&quot;Suddenly&quot; means a conference about four months ago.</p><p>Sanzang-chan was a indeed a special case, so it began production as a weeklong event.</p><p>But, the story ended up longer, so production was adjusted to make it a two week event.</p><p>Also, &quot;as planned a year ago&quot; refers to our initial schedule when FGO was being planned.</p><p>For example, the Servants that would appear in all seven chapters of the main story, and the event where the titles of all seven chapters were presented were already set back then (2014 UBW).</p><p>At the time, we still lacked knowhow, so we made a list of all the Servants, and then afterward came up with the rest of the plans for things like background story, illustrator commissions, or combat ideas.</p><p>The plot of the main story started from &quot;Servants to include&quot; and &quot;what we can do with that era.&quot;</p><p>Servants weren&#39;t included to fit the story, but rather, the story was created based on the Servants that would appear.</p><p>That&#39;s why, except for a portion, most of the Servants that have appeared were created &quot;as planned.&quot;</p><p>Conversely, you could say that Servants that appeared in events for the first time and didn&#39;t show up in the story were the &quot;sudden&quot; Servants.</p><p>The kind of production I&#39;ve described is based on our system when we were first planning the game, so since a certain point, development of both story and Servants has evolved into a more natural process.</p><p>That&#39;s the behind-the-scenes tidbit this time.

Piety is... Sanzang is... Getter is...&quot;</p><p>all converged and I ended up with the longest story yet. If Chapter 5 was 300 kb then Chapter 6 is 500 kb. Forgive me. Chapter 7 won&#39;t be that long.</p><p>Anyway, it&#39;s been 10 years since stay night, and I&#39;m quite happy to revisit this theme and write a story about King Arthur again.</p><p>We present to you a strange tale about a certain knight. Please enjoy.</p><p>Of course, I had to call on Sakurai-san&#39;s aid for the Egypt-related parts since there was no way Nasu could handle it all on my own. Specifically, for the Blue and Silver characters. Arash&#39;s regular life, Serenity-chan&#39;s hotness, and King Ozymandias impressing upon us his ideas of kingship and how he&#39;d consider this situation.</p><p>In other words, the Egyptians, Arash-san, and Serenity-chan were like a collaboration with Sakurai-san.</p><p>King Ozymandias of Blue &amp; Silver and King Ozymandias of Chapter 6 both appear as an unassailable troublemaker. Coupled with Koyasu&#39;s character voice, that invincible air is no joke.</p><p>To put it dramatically,</p><p>&quot;The ancient Sun King, &#39;I&#39;ll show you a true Beamer&#39; Ozymandias is here!!!</p><p>But I&#39;ll pass on a fight with Moses, &#39;cause that dude&#39;s liable to part the sea with his fists!&quot;</p><p>Something like that.

Using the power of the Holy Grail, the expeditionary force approaches the Holy Land. Dedicating everything to the King of Magic, they set fire to the land and slaughter the people. However, in their greed they summon the Pharaoh. Naturally, the Pharaoh confiscates their grail, creates the Egyptian Territory, and sets about building his own kingdom there.</li><li>The expeditionary force loses ground. The one chosen by the Holy Grail is cornered by the people of the Holy Land. But then, a mysterious Servant appears and summons the &quot;False Crusaders.&quot; Though this Servant identifies themselves as Richard I, their appearance and behavior are far too different from his. The False Crusaders capture the expeditionary force and occupy the Holy Land.</li><li>The Lion King arrives in the singularity and summons the Knights of the Round Table.</li><li>The Knights of the Round Table battle the False Crusaders. The expeditionary force is annihilated. The Holy Land falls. The Holy City is completed.</li><li>Xuanzang-chan suddenly appears</li><li>Chaldea begins the Sixth Grand Order</li></ol><p>That&#39;s more or less what happened before the beginning of Chapter 6.</p><p>When the Lion King appeared in the Sixth Grand Order, she summoned the Heroic Spirits of the Round Table with her own power.</p><p>(This is different than the summoning method used by Chaldea)</p><p>All but two of the Knights responded to the summons, and were informed of the world&#39;s collapse, and how in half a year&#39;s time all would be reduced to nothing by the King of Magic. And, the Lion King told them about the &quot;means of salvation by the holy lance,&quot; their best hope of counteracting it.</p><p>In the solemn morning glow, the Lion King proclaimed:</p><p>&quot;I summoned you knights because I require your power. While I can destroy my enemies alone, I cannot perform the Holy Selection. I need knights that will become my hands and feet. However. I understand that this act violates your beliefs. Will you obey me, or will you leave my side? Or, will you band together here to strike me down? I will hear your answers at sundown. I can wait no longer than that.&quot;</p><p>And so, the Knights of the Round Table each fretted over their choice.</p><p>There would surely be those who sided with the Lion King, just as there would surely be those who tried to stop her.</p><p>In either case, the enemy would be their fellow Knights.</p><p>Nobody was going to leave. If they disagreed with the Lion King, they had no choice but to enact the death penalty.</p><p>That, in turn, meant fighting their comrades who had chosen to follow her.</p><p>Sir Kay was strangely silent, and vanished till sunset without saying a word.</p><p>Sir Percival politely exchanged words with all of the other Knights one by one, and weeped alone.</p><p>Sir Gawain understood the significance of King Arthur calling herself the &quot;Lion King.&quot;</p><p>Sir Tristan blinded himself to the tragedy of the situation.</p><p>Sir Lancelot, though he was loathe to admit it, realized that the Lion King&#39;s choice was making the best of a bad situation.</p><p>Gaheris resolved himself to parting with his older brothers and younger sisters.</p><p>Gareth never once doubted that Sir Lancelot, whom she revered, would surely choose to aid King Arthur.</p><p>After the longest half a day of their lives, the Knights of the Round Table convened before the Lion King, as those that would stop her, and those that would serve her.</p><p>Battle was inevitable.</p><p>No matter what they chose, they would be forced to strike down those who were most dear to them with their own hands.</p><p>Because, the only way to protect the Lion King was to kill their fellow countrymen.</p><p>And, the only way to put the Lion King to death was to eliminate the compatriots standing in their way.</p><p>Neither camp bore any hatred for the other.</p><p>There was only grim resolution.</p><p>Like that, the Knights of the Lion King were born.</p><p>They struck down those they loved the most, and became beasts.</p><p>Even if they tried to survive, they no longer possessed the qualifications to be chosen by the Holy Lance.</p><p>They accepted the fact that no matter what they did, they would not be rewarded. They were sinners, doomed to be burnt away with the era.</p><p>Then, the Lion King bestowed &quot;Gifts&quot; upon the Knights stained by their comrades&#39; blood.</p><p>Tristan received the Gift of &quot;Inversion,&quot; for she saw his fingers were completely frozen from despair.</p><p>Gawain received the Gift of &quot;Everlight,&quot; for he wanted to maximize his usefulness.</p><p>Mordred received the Gift of &quot;Rampage.&quot; It wasn&#39;t asked for, but it was given.</p><p>Gareth received the Gift of &quot;Impurity,&quot; for she wished to avoid being defiled any further.</p><p>Lancelot received the Gift of &quot;Ferocity,&quot; for he vowed to ascertain the situation as a person, without martyring himself for justice.</p><p>And, Agravain received the Gift of &quot;Needlessness,&quot; for he had declared before all that he had no need for a Gift from the Lion King.</p><p>The Lion King and her Knights marched into the Holy Land controlled by the False Crusaders.</p><p>Though the False Crusaders were no match for them, the Servant calling himself Richard I was demonically strong.</p><p>&quot;Even the Knights of the Round Table can&#39;t possibly defeat this devil without loss. A sacrifice of two... no, three of our own will be necessary.&quot;</p><p>As Gawain made that judgment, a single Knight charged forward, restraining Richard at the cost of skewering her own chest.</p><p>It was Gareth.</p><p>Gareth&#39;s heart had long since shattered to pieces over the course of their many battles.</p><p>Killing her beloved comrades.</p><p>Killing knights, false though they may be.</p><p>Killing the people of the Holy Land, day in and day out.</p><p>Mummy-like bags had appeared under her eyes, and her lily-white fingers that had once been more beautiful than anyone&#39;s were unrecognizably blackened from the washing she performed after combat.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry. Even though I chose this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can&#39;t bear it any longer. I can&#39;t fight any more. Please. Please.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m a fool. Please, punish me.&quot;</p><p>It was the perfect opportunity to kill the enemy leader.</p><p>Lancelot froze. He understood Gareth&#39;s feelings, but was hesitant to once more do the deed.</p><p>Mordred raged. She had tried to stop her, saying they could win without making such sacrifices.</p><p>Agravain quietly placed his hand on the sword hanging at his side. He understood what must be done.</p><p>However. The one who swung his sword and dealt the mortal blow was Gawain.</p><p>Along with the last remnants of his heart, he bid farewell to his little sister.</p><p>Thus, the Holy Land passed into the Lion King&#39;s hands, and the Immaculate Holy City manifested itself.</p><h2 id="_2016-6-11-untitled-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2016-6-11-untitled-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2016/6/11: Untitled.

An all-purpose weapon weapon that can deal with any situation. That it&#39;s plain-looking is but a fly in the ointment.</p><p>If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, just skip this part.</p><hr><p>Now. FGO is finally about to begin its fifth chapter.</p><p>Chapters 1 to 4 have been released as we first produced them, but chapter 5 has benefited from seven months of popularity, and has some additional scenarios.</p><p>Kinoko topped off the stuff the writers submitted, and some extra spice was added after hearing user feedback. That&#39;s what Chapter 5 is.</p><p>If you open the lid, you&#39;ll find twice the jar&#39;s original capacity, and it&#39;s mainly become something like a collaboration... but what&#39;s done is done.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this action-adventure story the two writers worked so hard on, that is the voluminous chatper so far.</p><p>And so, the white-robed angel&#39;s identity is finally clear. Angelic... I guess she&#39;s angelic? Let&#39;s talk about the angelic Nightingale. When one mentions Nightingale, you imagine a white-clad angel, like Mentholatum&#39;s symbolic Little Nurse on their logo, right?</p><p>Me too. Until I researched the esteemed lady&#39;s lifetime!</p><p>I can say this now -- during the development of Fate/EXTRA CCC, Miss Nightingale was a candidate Heroic Spirit for a new enemy Servant all the way up to the end. Going with CCC&#39;s theme, I wanted to make characters almost exclusively female. Smells like a fetish.</p><p>In the end we only got enough budget to add Elizabeth, but I always wanted to show Nightingale&#39;s steel conviction one day.</p><p>And when it was decided that FGO&#39;s fifth chapter would take place in America, it felt like destiny and I was really happy.</p><p>Immediately I decided that she would be the navigator heroine.</p><p>You might protest &quot;but she isn&#39;t white-robed at all!&quot; I assure that you&#39;ll forget all about it once you start Chapter 5.</p><p>&quot;Clothes a priestess wears become priestess&#39; robes.

And, it finally starts tomorrow.</p><p>Pay attention to Helena, Nighting, and ______&#39;s relationship that I don&#39;t really understand.</p><hr><p>That said, let me follow up on the inappropriate remark in the AnimeJapan collab event.</p><p>She said &#39;FGO in its latter half,&#39; but of course that&#39;s only the first portion of the stories.

There are many others so its authenticity isn&#39;t certain, but it at least has a connection to her, right?&quot;</p><p>This line was cut down for the anime.</p><p>That said, Glastonbury was a really beautiful place.</p><p>I can&#39;t quite put into words what I felt when I went through the gate and saw that meadow.</p><p>To put it in game terms, it was the emotion of leaving Kokiri Village for the first time in Ocarina of Time for the N64 + the world of ICO (PS2) in reality.</p><p>If you ever plan on traveling to England, by all means take the time to go there.</p><ul><li>The very final scene</li></ul><p>It&#39;s a scene that you&#39;ll understand if you review it again, but it was easily misunderstood so here&#39;s the excerpt from the script.</p><ul><li>Wasteland scene</li></ul><p>&quot;After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland.</p><p>Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt.</p><p>Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone&#39;s footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking).</p><p>Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope.</p><p>Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait.</p><p>The camera stops at Archer&#39;s trail, and the scene ends on Shirou&#39;s back, shrinking in the distance.</p><p>(To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it&#39;d be best if you didn&#39;t)&quot;</p><p>He&#39;s not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point.</p><p>◆</p><p>On that note, the &quot;stay night&quot; aspect of Fate concluded with a splendid final episode.</p><p>But, I&#39;m afraid to say that the Fate anime won&#39;t end yet.

Enough about all that story writing stuff.</p><p>This time, there’s something even more important to discuss, you know?</p><p>That’s right, why don’t we talk about the extraordinarily powerful background song!</p><p>When Shirou does xxxxx, the background music is by Aimer, who also did the opening theme “Brave Shine.”</p><p>The name of that song is “LAST STARDUST.”</p><p>Actually, both of these songs were submitted by Aimer as candidates for the opening theme of UBW’s second season.</p><p>They’re both great songs that elevate the themes of UBW, so frankly, we were writhing with indecision over which one to use.</p><p>As a result, we strategized that the opening needed a feeling of speed, so we went with “Brave Shine.”</p><p>As a theme song, “LAST STARDUST” was outstanding in my mind.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it breaks our hearts to have to pick only one… but we’d be happy to see “LAST STARDUST” used in Sakura’s route, so plan for that, please!”</p><p>Is what we insisted to Aimer.</p><p>Three months later, somehow a recording of “LAST STARDUST” that was more polished than the demo version reached my ears.</p><p>Nasu: “How!? No, I’m incredibly happy though! I’m not exaggerating when I say that I can taste UBW just by hearing this! But why did they spend so much time making it!?”</p><p>Director Miura: “Ah, about that. I requested it as a background song because I really wanted to attach it to episode 20. But, we didn’t know if it would go well, so we didn’t tell you until it did. Tee-hee.”</p><p>Nasu: “Dammit man, you kept quiet about something this important—</p><p>Don’t mind me, just keep doing this——!”</p><p>And so we got the best possible result.</p><p>Who would’ve thought that it would become a scene brilliant as only an anime could be?</p><p>It was Director Miura’s idea to play “LAST STARDUST” during the farewell scene in the internal world.</p><p>This didn’t come out of the scriptwriting stage.</p><p>Making the story of an anime is like a baton relay.</p><p>The continuity of the script is handed over the the continuity or production, ultimately resulting in many times more good things.</p><p>One such miracle is this episode’s background song, which came out of this process.</p><p>Both “Brave Shine” and “LAST STARDUST” being in the same production distinguished the power that came out of this series of events.</p><p>The full versions of both songs are an even deeper experience, so please buy the single if you like them. They’re really good.</p><p>What? There’s no release date yet?</p><p>You’ll just have to believe in the courage of Sony Music…!</p><p>◆</p><p>And now, please enjoy the five remaining episodes of the TV anime UBW.</p><p>My gratitude to Aimer for their wonderful compositions and songs, and their cooperation that showed a deep appreciation of our work.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/bamboo.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
